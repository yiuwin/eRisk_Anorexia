	<TEXT> Hello guys! From Manila, Philippines here! I ordered a Refurbished Wii U at Nintendo.com last December of 2014 and have my relative brought it here in Manila since they're going home from USA. I just received the Wii U and I was surprised that it has a pre-installed Digital copy of **Super Mario 3D World**! I love Nintendo more! My Nintendo 2DS is now happy with my Wii U LOL! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-01-05 04:57:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello! First of all, thank you for taking time rating my Primary Team. My secondary Trick Room team is still in the works but as of now I need your help about my team. Comments and Suggestions are highly recommended!

Meowstic (Male) @ Light Clay

Ability: Prankster

Level: 50

EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA

Bold Nature

IVs: HP, Def, SpA, SpD

- Psyshock

- Reflect

- Thunder Wave

- Light Screen

Main role is to set up Screens. When the screens are setup I usually use it for T. Wave my opponents team. His more of a support role for my team.

Azumarill (Female) @ Sitrus Berry

Ability: Huge Power

Level: 50

EVs: 244 HP / 46 SpD / 220 Atk

Adamant Nature

IVs: HP, Atk, Def, SpD, Spe

- Aqua Jet

- Protect

- Belly Drum

- Play Rough

Basically when Azumarill sets up Belly Drum I usually use it to Aqua Jet but with the help of Meowstic's T. Wave Play Rough is an alternative move to use.

Electivire (Male) @ Air Balloon

Ability: Vital Spirit

Level: 50

EVs: 252 Atk / 252 Spe / 4 HP

Adamant Nature

IVs: HP, Atk, Def, SpD, Spe

- Thunder Punch

- Ice Punch

- Earthquake

- Brick Brake

Most likely the Sweeper of the team. Ice Punch coverages Dragon   Ground type while Thunder Punch for STAB damage as well as fainting off Flying and Water types. Earthquake for Steel   Rock types and Brick Brake for Dark and Normal Types.

Volcarona (Female) @ Leftovers

Ability: Flame Body

Level: 50

EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA

Calm Nature

IVs: HP, Def, SpA, SpD, Spe

- Bug Buzz

- Heat Wave

- Quiver Dance

- Protect

Most likely the "stall" pokemon in my team. When Quiver Dance sets up its all offense for it.

Venusaur (Male) (Mega) @ Venusaurite

Ability: Overgrow/Thick Fat

Level: 50

EVs: 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Def

Bold Nature

- Sleep Powder

- Giga Drain 

- Protect

- Sludge Bomb

Most likely the one who makes Mega Kangaskhan sleep. I use Mega Venusaur in Sleep-Giga Drain strategy. When Meowstic's screen sets up its eats up Psychic, Fire   Ice type Special attack moves. Zen Headbutt and Brave Bird hurts but it barely survives it.

Lopunny (Female) (Mega) @ Lopunnite

Ability: Klutz/Scrappy

Level: 50

EVs: 252 Atk / 4 HP / 252 Spe

Jolly Nature

- Return

- Ice Punch

- Drain Punch

- Fake Out

My second Mega. She can deal with Gengars like apple pie. Her Fake Out helps when this Pokemon comes in. She is also my sweeper.

I kinda feel like my team is a Hyper Offensive team. Feel free to criticize, comment and suggest! Thank you very much /r/stunfisk! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...I'm not proud of it. The reason why I reactivated it after 11 months and 19 days, is because of two communities, [Pokemon Philippines](https://www.google.com.ph/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=web cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0CB4QFjAA url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpkmnph ei=y2dtVIraFYPXmAXeiID4Bg usg=AFQjCNGIRTPNoZwYgedkCDw0BjHbGMV6sw sig2=VAyvJ21YXUdTHvClMvmG1Q) (especially that they will have an event for Pokemon OR/AS launch and a send off farewell competition for X/Y this Saturday. I'm planning to compete!) and a Philippine 3DS community that has weekly Streetpass meet ups. I love having no Facebook but due to these communities that I love, I'm forced to reactivate it again. It sucks how everyone is in Facebook. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There is a 3DS community that has weekly StreetPass (SP) meetups at Ali Mall food court every Sunday 2pm onwards. I went there last Sunday and had a great time playing Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, Pokemon X/Y and Mario Kart 7! Other 3DS game includes Monster Hunter! You won't miss them because all of them are holding 3DS/2DS. Add to that I've also learned that there are other meetups as well in different locations such as...

Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall - Every Saturday at Jelly-G second floor (Near Abensons) 3pm onwards.

Ali Mall - Every Sunday at the Ali Mall food court 2pm onwards.

McDonald's North Ave. (In front of Trinoma) - Every Friday 2PM onwards.

SM Megamall - Every Saturday 2PM onwards at the SM Food court

EDIT: *Typo*

EDIT2: **UPDATED SCHED**

EDIT3: **Forgot to mention that almost everyone in the group are casual Smashers and Mario Kart racers though their Monster Hunter characters looks epic and their Pokemons are in competitive level but competitive or not every game there is fun to play!** </TEXT>

[Pic of the day. We've prepared many hats for Mii Fighters...but a lot of them are humorously designed, so it might be hard to coordinate them with flair. You could, of course, choose to not wear the hats at all... It makes me wonder--how is everyone planning to dress up their Mii Fighters? Well, one thing is for sure: the ninja headband worn by the Mii in front should look good with anything.](https://i.imgur.com/XCTbufS.jpg)

	<TITLE> Bayonetta 2 for the WiiU is worth it! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-22 10:21:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I watched a playthrough of the game from twitch who has a Japanese WiiU. 

First of all though, the game can be set to english language in the settings so it's understandable even though it's Japanese version. 

Second I know only a small information of Bayonetta 1 (PS3, Xbox 360) and with that being said, you can play Bayonetta 2 even though you haven't played Bayonetta 1. And why is that you ask? 

I don't want to spoil it. I can say it's one of the best Action games that I have ever seen both in gameplay and story. Seriously, it has some Devil May Cry references there up to the point that Bayonetta may know Dante. (It is to believe by fans that they're in the same Universe regardless that both of them are from different gaming companies.) Also, the Nintendo costumes for Bayonetta is fucking awesome! Chain Chomp weapon anyone?

In all seriousness, Nintendo is offering the best games as of this year with Super Mario 3D World, Mario Kart 8, Hyrule Warriors, Bayonetta 2, rumored StarFox WiiU and the up coming Super Smash Bros for WiiU add to that Ubisoft is now doing Watch Dogs for Wii U! Buying a PS4 can wait for me since Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy 15 and Tekken 7 are the only games that I'm looking forward to.

EDIT: *StarFox Easter Egg in Bayonetta 2 is confirmed! It's epic as fuck!* </TEXT>

Take note that I always use Assistive touch whenever I use my phone. I tried restoring it as a new iDevice but still no luck. Any advice what to do? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I've screwed up my friendship to one of my close friends. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I decided not to talk to him because I when he was single, he has time to hangout with me and our group of friends. When he got a girlfriend (fell in love with a single mom) he suddenly just went MIA. We do meet in a weekly basis because we're both in the same Church choir but after our Church service when I ask him if he wants to hangout, he always declines.

I am happy for him for what he is now but at the same time disappointed at him that's why I choose not to talk to him instead. I want him to make the effort. I really miss him because he is like a brother to me but there's a sense of hatred that built up. I want to talk to him but I'm afraid of talking to him because I might say something that may hurt him at the same time I'm afraid of whats he gonna say.

Make me feel better please and thank you... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Old post for referrence](http://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/288qct/anyone_here_got_their_drivers_license_confiscated).

I arrived at Manila City Hall by 8:30am. I gave my ticket to the authorized personnel and their system is they do it batch by batch. The department has 5 windows and the only functional windows are 4. My name was called at the 3rd batch went in line to the designated window, payed my fine   got my license by 9:40am. I was impressed on their system. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I got mine confiscated last week Tuesday because I right turned on a red light at Pureza Street in Manila City but before I turned right, there was no sign of 'No Right Turn on Red Light'. I told the officer that there was no sign but he still confiscated my license. I got a ticket   tomorrow I'm going to Manila City hall to pay the fine   a seminar maybe? Honestly, after that experience I have no more trust to Traffic officers.

My question is, did anyone experienced this and how did you get through? </TEXT>
