	<TITLE> Favorite Music of Disneyland </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I find myself listening to Disneyland music all the time. While I love the music, just the nostalgia is incredible. I love finding new tracks that you heard in the parks that bring back so many new memories. This leads me to my question. What is your favorite ride soundtrack, area music, or attraction music at Disneyland Resort?
(if you want to be really awesome you can post a link) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the most magical thing about Disneyland is the fact that this is where Walt stood and created this amazing place. I've never been to WDW but I feel like from a Californian perspective it's just trying to recreate the magic that Walt created. I'm sure you can have fun at any Disney theme park but Disneyland is truly the creation of Walt Disney and you just can't recreate that. Please don't hate on me for thinking this way. It's just my honest opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Despite being an overlay of a ride that already exists, I actually think Hyperspace Mountain may be my favorite. I already love star wars and racing around ti-fighters around jakku was really awesome.

My least favorite it easy. It has to be Autopia. I know everyone loves it because its nostalgic and stuff but I find it extremely boring and annoying. The steering barely does anything. You get a nice view of the rusting people-mover tracks. Not to mention it doesn't really fit in tomorrowland. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Star Wars Seasons of The Force Music? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi! In January I went to Disneyland and saw Star Wars seasons of the Force for the first time. I thought it was pretty cool. I noticed in the background they used a lot of star wars music. I couldn't quite make out some of the soundtracks. I really want to find them. It would be amazing if someone could compile a list of the music tracks in the background of the new Tomorrowland. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's true. However, I don't think it's new success has too much to do with that. Obviously they made Buena Vista St. which is beautiful. Tower of Terror, while based on the twilight zone, is an original concept. I think while some of its success came from IP attractions may have helped. There were other factors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes you're right. I didn't think about that. However, Matterhorn doesn't have that much to do about that movie. Obviously Pirates has been changed to fit in with the movie. However, they're not completely based on the movies. I guess space mountain is a better example. Thank you for pointing that out. </TEXT>

4. Cats going around at night eating mice. (I've even seen them during the day)

5. Tomorrowland should be deeply renovated. It needs better mobility and to be more futuristic. I also say that if they're going to keep the peoplemover track then they should do something with it.
