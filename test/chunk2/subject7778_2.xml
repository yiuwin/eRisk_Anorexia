	<TEXT> Actually, that's my point - I reserve the right not having to laugh when finding something unfunny. I've noticed how people tend to accuse others of not having a sense of humour, being overly sensitive, political or whatnot. The price for "freedom" of making any sort of joke, must be that people have the right to not laugh or be forced to find it funny.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't take it "personally" or anything, nor feel particularily political about it. Also, I would be shit, standing in front of an audience trying to get a laugh, so I respect people who does this for a living (or tries to) generally speaking. That doesn't prevent me from thinking that comedians that resort to aggressive stereotypical humour are rather, well, if not lazy, at least unskilled. I rarely find them funny. 

Judgements or home made analysis when not laughing, makes me cringe. That sort of reasoning is uncomfortably related to fundamentalistic views on what is to be considered to be "allowed" to joke about. I figure people should make jokes about anything they feel like, I however reserve my right not to laugh if I don't find it funny - it balances out in the grand scheme of things, I think.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've gone from sexy-cute to fat, old and I guess, rather ugly (as "not beautiful" tends to mean ugly these days).  The fat part I realized I worked on subconsiously, because being "shaggable" never really agreed with my personality, as great shagging is and all that. My self-confidence has always been healthy, which is the foundation for any kind of good looks in truth, but in regards of picture perfect or whatnot, it just wasn't enough. People treated me all kinds of weird, or I weirded out people by not behaving as they expected, and so on. 

I really loved your post because, I don't know any ugly people, and I have a friend with a deformity across half of her face. I just don't know what ugly is, in truth, I've come to think that people possibly mean "plain" or something like that, when they say ugly. I really struggle with this, because I simply can't tell what the hell ugly **is**.

I have another friend that jokes about not ever being noticed by waiters in restaurants. (I've seen it, it's hilarious.) They simply don't take any notice of her, and she often thinks about punishing them by leaving without paying for the meal. That is, if she ever gets to order. She's not ugly by any standards I know of, and if you know her (she's one of those that crack you up big time) you don't see her as anything but attractive, even if not a model. She's plain, I guess. Although she considers herself ugly, and gets p'o-ed at me when I give her a compliment about her looks.

Why is that, btw? Why do we compliment eachothers looks? I do enjoy a compliment, it's not that. But at work for instance, I've noticed that people tend to compliment clothing and hair, rather that great work. It's kind of annoying. A while back I started to make a point of complementing my collegues work. It's not like I've stopped complementing a great pair of shoes, but surely, professional achievements must be of more "value" than a pair of shoes? Even if they're designed by Prada?

Which leads me to the next conondrum. Why the hell are we supposed to be hurt by being told we're ugly? I know it's more a matter of picking up that somebody is wanting to hurt you, therefore it doesn't really matter what kind of mean stuff that is said, but still. I couldn't possibly care, really deep down, if I'm percieved as having "let myself go" (which I even have), why should I care getting a comment in regards of my looks? 

Guess I had a lot of pent of feelings regarding this, thanks for the space to vent! ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom, is like yours, made handwringing into an art form. Then something happened and she shocked us all by being extraordinarily strong, through two bouts of cancer and some other stuff that happened. It was truly amazing to see, and I had to reconsider my view of her. Much of her ways were based on "supposed to", for instance, and a scarily large amount about "I don't know any other way".

It's important to understand that generations of women were brought up to be "useless". Stereotypes we all have to live up to one way or another and it sucks. I find it important to try to break that vicious cycle. Exploiting this trained fear, for instance by pulling pranks, only reaffirms the roles. Sometimes people who quetch about this strikes me as being lost if it wasn't like this.

This requires good rolemodels and teachers-- expectations and upbringing is a bitch. I'm sure you do stuff on a reflex, that you have been taught, and has nothing to do with logic or your potential abilities. We all have that and it sucks. In order to challenge those things we need to stop confirming bullshit like it's a friggin natural law and stop propping up the stereotypes. 

Anyways, your mother would probably stop a bullet for you. I know my mother would. As useless as she was in the past. (And still is, to a degree.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing crossed my mind, it sucks to be raised to "not being able to defend yourself", being useless in situations like these, indeed. However, it makes for a great premise, doesn't it, to pull scary pranks on people who are supposedly not able to defend themselves? 

Reminds me of a friend who's boyfriend was supposed to be out of town hid under her bed, and once she sat down on it without any clothes, he grabbed her ankle. Needless to say, he had to stop going out of town entirely, since she never felt safe in her own home after that. (Personally, I'd kick his ass out, connecting his behaviour with unsafety rather than solitude, but we're all different I suppose.)

However, I doubt that men would react any different statisticly. Very few step up to the plate when shit goes down in public, for instance. The fear of weapons have started to lodge itself into the subconsious even in that gender, creating mental blocks for much needed defense mechanisms. So, I guess we're all getting to a point of of being useless, in that respect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the article:
It's no surprise the religion was born in Swedenit has some of the laxest copyright laws in the world. The Swedish Pirate Party has two seats in the European Parliament, and The Pirate Bay, a Swedish website that's one of the world's largest portals to illegal files, has avoided being shut down for years.

How on earth does seats in the EU parlament equal "laxest copyright laws in the world"? This is nonsense that turn up now and again in reporting, and I simply don't get it. The guys that ran TPB are sentenced to jail, for goodness sake, and have been ordered to pay millions. It's because the copyright laws are completely off the wall that a Pirate Party was created to begin with, it's a reaction to the laws. It's almost like other nations believe that because we have such lax laws, we are "allowed" to create political momentum for change. Same goes, apparantly, for anybody wanting to create a new religion or whatnot - that lax copyright laws "allows" for it to happen. That underlying notion, that critizing copyright law ought to be forbidden as if that's a natural state, creeps me out to no end.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I'm not really informed in the reasoning behind that particular regulation but it was ruled a while back that people are allowed to make copies for private use. My (not enitrely educated) guess is that it's a matter of recognizing some kind of ownership/right to the customer who has puchased something. Basically a sort of limitation on how far copyright is allowed to reach into your every day life. Books, however, is exemptet from this rule, it would seem. I have absolutely no idea about the logic behind that. It's okay to lend it to people though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The abstrakt in this working paper: 
"Since the sinking of the Titanic, there has been a widespread belief that the social norm of women and children first gives women a survival advantage over men in maritime disasters, and that captains and crew give priority to passengers. We analyze a database of 18 maritime disasters spanning three centuries, covering the fate of over 15,000 individuals of more than 30 nationalities. Our results provide a new picture of maritime disasters. Women have a distinct survival disadvantage compared to men. Captains and crew survive at a significantly higher rate than passengers. We also find that the captain has the power to enforce normative behavior, that the gender gap in survival rates has declined, that women have a larger disadvantage in British shipwrecks, and that there seems to be no association between duration of a disaster and the impact of social norms. Taken together, our findings show that behavior in life-and-death situation is best captured by the expression Every man for *himself*

Apparantly the Titanic is an exception of the statistical rule, because the captain threatened to shoot the men unless they let women and children to be first off the ship. The resarchers of the paper suggest that his action gave birth to the widely spread notion of "women and children first".

Personally, I was a bit surprised at the findings, thought it would be interesting to you guys as well. The psyche (if that's a correct way of putting it) of this kind of thinking is often criticized, as it to some proves that genders aren't equal, since one group is considered worth saving over the other; it gives women a better position than men is the general idea. However, I do find it interesting that when push comes to shove, it would appear that the norm isn't really a practice according to this paper, and I wonder how that will affect those, often times, infected debates? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Though, as a Swede, I have to give him points for mentioning the flexibility in the educational system. It's not cramming as much as it is learning by ability and interest, no? Also, the fact that teaching is a profession that has a better status than most counties. One could argue that the competetiveness is in the profession of teaching, than in the students, is the impression I've gotten. The point is, that allow for individuals to grow, regardless of background or social setting is quite unique. Testing, I understand it, is a semi-volontary deal, as a tool for students themselves regarding degree of ambition, for instance? Finland is spearheading in education, that shouldn't be disregarded because the guy in the vid, took "poetic license", I reckon. Finland does do things differently when they educate their children, and I suppose it's a bit ironic that it's so difficult to process exactly what it is! ;) </TEXT>

Apparantly a social media advisor had said that it's important to be around when putting stuff up online, which is a good advice really, but I doubt they meant this. I assume there are loads of seemingly good, reasons for those that decide to disable comments, so maybe advisors should consider telling people to at least explain why in the description? I dunno if it's prefered in general, but personally I always like to know the reasons behind it to better understand, to the rest of us, seemingly weird decisions. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-03-11 10:22:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I stumbled on a few threads where people basically [ruined](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/qqsk7/4chan_is_a_force_to_be_reckoned_with/) other people's lives - because they could. Too often the blame is put on the victim. I don't get it. I don't understand how people hoot and holler and seem to think it's cool that somebody is being an asshole. What the hell is up with that? I notice this bevaviour all over, and it's a disgrace. Particularily when it turns [up here on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays+none/comments/qn43l/low_effortpost_in_which_a_student_posts_a_picture/), where people pride themselves as aware or whatnot, and not seldom stand up against bullying.

For example: I feel that you can joke about anything. Anything. It's well within your rights to find whatever funny--if you start limiting things like that you're just asking for fundamental problems in a society, however "cultural" a sense of humour may be. But that does not in any way mean that **I must find the jokes funny**, dammit. Why are people having problems with this concept? Hell, some even get aggrivated when other people don't find a joke funny -- like we have some sort of frigging responsibility, seeing how it's allowed to joke!?

In order to have some sort of working democracy we have to put up with people being different than ourselves. It's a basic requirement, you can't have one without the other. That means that we need to have access to anonymity as well as [privacy](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/qqyhz/the_12yearold_was_punished_for_statements_she/), we need to accept that people have different needs. But it does not cover being responsible when somebody is exploiting this fact to be an asshole to another human being. We have to stop rewarding shitty behaviour and stop punishing those that doesn't live up to our "high standards of human righteousness".

And I'm not even considering criminal behaviour here; just that somebody wanted some attention is damn well not worthy of having your life ruined. For God's sake - just don't give any, then!

The proportionality of some shit that goes down is way off the scale. Sometimes I wonder if it's some sort of paid army of percieved morons being out there (frequently cheered on by bystanders in search of social belonging) so that governments get enough support to bring out god-awful laws to forever keep us silent. Yeah, I know, we are doing this seemingly effortless to ourselves. I wish it was a great conspiracy, I guess, in order to hold on to some shred of hope for humanity.

The inability to keep more than one principial thought in the mind of the average user, drives me nuts. We want free speech, we need anonymity it's important, dammit. **This does not mean that bullies are to be rewarded, just because they are allowed or able to it.**

This sort of psychology goes way beyond the forums and social medias online -- it's reflected in the political systems. Where people who are being mistreated by the state probably had it coming... the stupidity of this kind of thinking is staggering. All over the world "democracies" are demounting free spech and anonymity at an alarming rate. This everybody knows and most object to, but few connect their own enabling behaviour that allows this to continue. We must learn to put some pressure on wrong doers instead of blaming victims, both in big and in seemingly small. 

I guess I'm mostly mad for not doing it more often myself. Thanks for the opportunity to vent, though. </TEXT>

 The timing: A court order is limited to the primary foundation, Acta superseeds those issues. Questions regarding the Unions future internationeal trade relations and the industies possibilities to develop dynamicly on the internet, for instance. Those issues can only be dealt with though political institutions. Pushing it to the court is merely a delay, those issues will remain. 

 Which questions will be asked by the commission to the court? How relevant are they going to be in how the Union's law, present and future, are to be interpreted in lieu of Acta, or is this merely a way to buy some time? The overwhelming protests surrounding Acta has made quite a stirr, and this may provide some peace and quiet without actually having to lose face, and not having to denounce the agreement.

Otherwise - Yay!  </TEXT>

Since the reporter was careful to put in quotes from Gingrich, and some other references to the republicans, I got the impression that it was important to them to keep a balance. Which I figure they succeeded with, even if it's most likely difficult to be "neutral" when talking to kids who's gone to bed hungry, I'm guessing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps it's my european eyes that reads this between the lines, but I didn't get the impression that Obama was to "blame" as much as that expectations fell short, expectations that he would handle it? The basic argument in the segment seems to me, to be that - right or wrong - neither republicans nor democrats are either able or willing to handle this issue. </TEXT>
