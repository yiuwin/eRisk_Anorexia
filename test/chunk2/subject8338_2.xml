	<TEXT> Well, my hair is about medium length, too short to wear without any product. What I normally do is towel dry it, take a medium sized hunk of the Axe Messy Look Paste and spread it through my hair a bit, and then go through it with a towel and pat it down. I let it stay like that for about half an hour and then I mess it up with a towel one last time to dry it and pat it down again. Normally it turns out looking pretty stupid, but every once in a while it looks really cool, like in the pictures. It's a hit or miss thing, really. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sixteen, even though I look a bit young, and I posted here a while ago and got some good responses, but some people said my photos were sorta stupid and to loose the hair cut I had then. I lost the bieber haircut and tried to stop making that stupid expression I had in my other photos.  I'm not quite confident of how good I look now, so what do you guys think? Sorry for all the different links, by the way.

I'm thinking American Idiot would be up there, considering the critical response the entire album got. 

 So, Reddit, what songs that have been released in like the 2000's do you think will be, in the future, considered classics like "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Hard Day's Night", "London Calling" etc.?
