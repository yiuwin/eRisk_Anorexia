	<TITLE> Wondering what my best option is now? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I have been a long time sim addict, being in the perfect generation for growing into adulthood as the games progressed. (Oh, middle school) When I graduated high school in 2008 I got a macbook from my parents and immediately bought sims 3 and played it literally too often. Over the years I have bought most (if not all) of the expansion packs. (I also bought sims medieval which i love) Within the past year though, I haven't been able to play at all because for some reason my computer keeps saying that it's not a valid copy of sims 3, which I can honestly tell you it is. I called customer service and he said that there must be a glitch in the first disc so I should uninstall everything and then reinstall it in order. That would be only a minimal bummer if I hadn't lost the original disc (and maybe an expansion or three) a couple of years ago in a move. I guess my question now is, what is my best option? My boyfriend is pretty convinced that my laptop is getting too old for them and I mean, they ran sloooowwwww so it wouldn't surprise me. And I wouldn't want to waste the money on repurchasing multiple games if they aren't going to work. I thought you guys would have the best advice! Thanks in advance, I hope this all made sense  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was a very young baby my Mom had a similar run in with Jeffrey Dahmer (I'm from Milwaukee WI) at Mitchell Park. Obviously, it's a bit different because he targeted men and she was a woman, but she said she spoke with him multiple times and he was very pleasant and it just terrified her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I have, but it was only once. It was also shortly after all that drama about the pharmacist's right to deny and whatnot. I have had multiple friends who have had to switch gynos for this very reason though. </TEXT>
