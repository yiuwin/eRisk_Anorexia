	<TEXT> Young people are generally more open with it (hard to give a statistical number) but generally people are still quite conservative. It is improving though. If you are a foreigner its less of an issue but id still suggest being cautious.

Dont get me wrong, its still a wonderful country and there are some amazing things and places that you will see(especially if you go to less known places) but the concept of kissing in public and things like that are less common so its kind of strange for locals.

If you want more info this was a nice read written by a foreigner:

(personally i dont agree with 2 though....its extremely cold in some places...i suggest you visit nuwera eliya...AKA Little England)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LESS KNOWN FACT. This video is about the The Japanese Peace Treaty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_San_Francisco) after the second world war in which the then President of Sri Lanka  J.R. Jayewardene convinced the treaty partners to sign the treaty and was formally received by resounding applause by the global stage.It is said that this speech had a significant effect on the treaty allowing it to be passed.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0FTwGA9H0E
 (1951 Sep 01)

New York Times stated: "The voice of free Asia, eloquent, melancholy and still strong with the lilt of an Oxford accent, dominated the Japanese peace treaty conference today."
