	<TITLE> Things you should know about Reinhardt's Shield </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-25 12:23:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> - Reinhardt's shield is not invulnerable  
  
If you see a hostile Rein, shoot his shield.  
If you are behind a friendly Rein, shoot the damn turret that is shooting his shield.  
   
   
- Reinhardt needs to drop his shield to recharge it  

If your didn't shoot that damn turret, don't call Rein an idiot for not having his shield up when it went down.  
  
  
- You can shoot through a friendly Reinhardt's shields  
  
"Rein's shield was in the way" is not a valid excuse for not shooting that damn turret. Nor is it an excuse to run ahead of the protected area and immediately get killed.  
  
  
- Some attacks, notably Symmetra's alt fire, Reinhardt's fire strike and all melee attacks can go through Reinhardt's shield   

Do not blame lag or hackers if you die to these attacks while hiding behind Rein's shield  
  
- You can walk through a hostile Reinhardt's shield   
  
Again, no blaming lag or hacks or Rein because you didn't shoot that hostile before he walked through. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With the patch I've noticed that a [M] has appeared next to the save files of one of my characters.
It's also deleted some of the files related to that character.  
This is a character I renamed later in the game with console commands and I've used some modded content on it.  
Any idea what it means exactly?     
I suspect it might have disabled achievements, unless the "instigator" achievement requires something other than assigning settlers to an arena pad, hitting the quitting time siren then letting them fight. </TEXT>

I mean for tank suit shiny and glowier might make you a more obvious target, but you are just advertising you got rank 5, so they might switch targets.  
But for a DPS suit, why would you want to advertise "This guy is probably not a total PVP noob!"?

Now I can't control that settlement.

So is there a way to get that settlement?  
Any console commands to allow me to take control? Or some way to convince the BoS QM to let that settlement go?  
I've been playing for a long time and I've never gotten a Minutemen quest to help the settlement and it's the last settlement on the map not under my control. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What unit of measurement are they using for Water and Fuel? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've noticed that water and fuel in the post mission screen are measure in terms of Ml (Mi?).  
This doesn't make alot of sense to me. If it's a Mega liter, that the carrier is holding a ridiculous amount of fluids. 700 million liters of fuel at the start of the expedition. For comparison an olympic swimming pool has 2.5 million liters of water. A Nimitz class carreir holds less than 12 million liters of fuel for it's aircraft.  
So does Ml stand for something else? or is it Mi? Anyone know?  
  
EDIT: For comparison, [this](http://www.marineinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/TI_Europe.jpg) is what a ship designed to carry only 500 Megaliters of oil looks like. That's the sole purpose of the TI-class Supertanker and it's already massive. </TEXT>
