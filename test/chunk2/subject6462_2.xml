	<TITLE> So I usually weigh myself first thing in the morning but on a whim decided to weigh myself before bed... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> ...and I weigh less than I did this morning! 4.4 lbs less, to be exact. I usually try to avoid weighing at night because 99% of the time I gain a few pounds of water weight and go to bed feeling like a failure.

But tonight was different. I went to my friend's house to watch the latest ep of The Bachelorette (obsessed) and ended up drinking wine and eating cheese with them. I was mad at myself for ruining all of the fasting progress I made today, and felt inclined to see what the scale had to say about it. I'm still really curious to see where I'm at in the morning but more than that I'm bewildered. Has anyone else experienced this?  </TEXT>

The weekends tend to be rough because I stay at my boyfriend's place for the duration. This time was a different story. I managed to turn down candy, popcorn, AND pizza. All things I love and crave. Instead I fasted most of Saturday and Sunday I had half a hot dog and a big salad. 


I feel ready for this week.  </TEXT>

This past weekend was all over the place for me food-wise because it was my 1-yr anniversary with my boyfriend. I probably took in at least 2000 calories on Saturday :( but they were delicious calories so at least there's that. 

And the good news is when I weighed myself this morning I was pleased to see that I was still down 2 (!!!) lbs from last week. I'm not updating my flair until I see that same number or less three more times this week but I'm glad this past weekend didn't fuck up all of my progress or throw me off track.  </TEXT>
