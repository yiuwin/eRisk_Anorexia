	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Rebooting a film doesn't mean you hate it or find something wrong with it....but that there's something you want to change/improve.

For example;

I would reboot BvS, but instead of there being a two year timeskip since MoS....it's only a month after.

That small change would create a different plot entirely, more focused on the BZ event and Superman growing as a hero and getting used to Metropolis while healing from PTSD and the backlash from the public.

Luthor's presence would be felt, but he would just be a loved Billionaire helping out the city......his evil machinations would be subtle and in the background since he's more focused on the "larger plan". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "This arc is so strange! 

Why did Pudding whisper the plan to Nami and Luffy and then continue to fake smile as she left? Her family knows of her bad side so why pretend? 

How does Pudding with such importance to Big Mom have no observation Haki to sense Sanji outside the window during her conversation with Reiju? 

Why did Big Mom order Luffy and co to be captured alive if she intended on killing them anyway? 

Why did she call Luffy to tell him she would let them go after the wedding if she was planning to kill them anyway? Why bother calling people locked away in a prison cell, unable to move? 

Why does Big Mom assume that after she kills the Vinsmokes she'll automatically gain control of their technology that she has no knowledge of and the loyalty of the Germa soldiers who were genetically modified to be subservient to the Vinsmokes themselves? 


That's like killing Caesar Clown to get his inventions instead of having him work for you. No sense to it. 

Why is the Charlotte Family so incompetent that they not only fail to kill 6 people outnumbered by an island's worth of fighters, but also outright lie about killing the SH's thus endangering the plans, sleep inside their prisoner's bed, and not even check to see if the person in the bed is truly Sanji? 

Why is Brulee and co. so insistent on divulging their plans to the enemy? 

Why is Sanji insisting on staying to die even though he knows the plan?

Why does he think Luffy will get away even though Pudding said everyone would be killed? 

Why did simply touching meat turn him from resigning to his death to running to feed Luffy? 

Why did Big Mom let Jimbe walk free if the dial was made to kill them on the spot? Why does she even need the dial to kill them? 

Why did Peckoms bring the SHs who he has shown incredible gratitude to for saving Zou to Whole Cake Island despite knowing the truth about the wedding? 

Why did Lola give Nami a Vivre Card leading her to Big Mom if she knew her family was like this?

I don't understand this arc anymore."

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What do you think are the prospects for a civil engineer (with Masters) from a Top 25 university outside America?

Would working for a engineering consultancy like Arup, being in the Australian reserve army and knowing multiple languages help in me getting into an MBA at Wharton/HBS?

Please don't misunderstand, I'm currently on the cusp of finishing my undergrad and starting my Masters.....I'm just thinking of a plan to get to that MBA.

My CV/Resume is bare at the moment (other than a few extra curriculars), so I would love any advice on how to spruce it up before the 5-6 year mark (when I'll hopefully apply).

Thank you

	<TEXT> Why give him a full CGI body when they could've used a combination of special effects and prosthetics? This would have allowed Fisher the opportunity to act with his entire body, not just his head.

Hell, you could say that the Motherbox was able to mimic the texture of skin - giving him the "guise" of a normal body that transforms like Ironman's [Bleeding Edge armour](http://imgur.com/a/agB5L).

I didn't really say anything when we first saw Cyborg's body in the first trailer and poster......since it was obvious the CGI hadn't been completed yet.

I had assumed there would be a few more modifications to his image, but nothing has really changed.

This is obviously my opinion, but looking at Fisher's hard work - I would have opted for a Cyborg that is closer to his physique.

	<TEXT> I had an interesting conversation yesterday, which has made me think about the differences in people's opinions regarding a specific scene.



We hear the word campy, cheesy and cringe quite a lot, but it's always been hard to specify what makes it so.

Is it the script, editing, direction, the scene composition...the acting?

I was interested to hear from the subreddit - what is your definition of campy/cheesy?

What scene in the DCEU would you describe as "campy"?

I posted it here verbatim.

I disagreed with some some of his points, but it's a fun read.


**GOROSEI**


 DEFEATED THE ENTIRE PEOPLE OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM 800 yrs ago ( THE VOID CENTURY ).


 The ANCIENT Kingdom was a great   powerful kingdom that was destroyed by the Twenty Kingdoms, who are now the World Government. The kingdom was so powerful ( AS STRONG IF NOT STRONGER THAN ROGER ) that its existence posed a great threat to the world.


 THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE ON THAT ISLAND HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAFEGUARD THE THREE GREAT POWERS BECAUSE OF THEIR STRENGTH THUS THE WAR WITH THEM.


 AFTER THEIR VICTORY AGAINST THE ANCIENT KINGDOM, THE CELESTIAL DRAGONS ALSO KNOWN AS THE WORLD NOBLES WERE THEN FORMED ( ELIMINATE THE WEAK ).


 IN ORDER TO KEEP FIGHTING AGAINST WG, THE WILL OF D IS PASSED ON TO THE SURVIVORS.


 THE GOROSEI ARE AFRAID OF THE D BECAUSE OF ITS PURPOSE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE ENTIRE WORLD TO TURN AGAINST THEM.


 THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY STAYED ALIVE FOR 800 YRS TILL THE PRESENT TIME BY USING JEWELRY BONNRY TO KEEP THEM FROM AGEING.


 THEY THEN FORMED THE WARLORDS   CIPHERS TO STOP PIRATES   YONKOS ACROSS THE ENTIRE WORLD FROM GOING OVERBOARD.


 TO KEEP THE PIRATES OR ANYONE ELSE FROM USING OR FINDING THE THREE GREAT POWERS, THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CREATE PONEGLYPHS TO HID ITS LOCATIONS THUS BEING OUTLAWED.


 ONLY FEW PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD HAVE KNOWN THE TRUE MEANING OF D   THE EXISTENCE OF THE ANCIENT PEOPLE 800 YRS AGO, e.g constant chase for Gol D Roger INCLUDING his WIFE and SON by THE ENTIRE MARINE FORCE.


 ROBIN KNOWS THAT IF THE WG WERE TO USE THE THREE GREAT POWERS IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE, IT WOULD CAUSE MASSIVE DESTRUCTION   CHAOS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WORLD WHICH IS WHY SHE NEEDS TO DECRYPT THE PONEGLYPHS TO PINPOINT THE LOCATIONS OF THESE WEAPONS SO THAT THE GOROSEI WON'T BE ABLE TO USE THEM IN TIME.


 ALSO THE REASON TO WHY ROBIN'S HOMETOWN WAS DESTROYED AS THEY HOLD THE SECRETS   WHEREABOUTS OF THE PONEGLYPS   THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INCIDENT from 800 yrs ago e.g, Ancient Kingdom's Lost Name.


 FOR EVERY WARLORD/CIPHER/ADMIRAL THAT LUFFY/ANYONE ELSE HAS DEFEATED, THE GOROSEI IS FORCED TO UPHOLD THEIR PUBLIC IMAGE BY LYING TO THE WORLD ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, e.g GEKKO MORIAH DYING IN A WAR.


 THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY IS RESCUING EVERY SLAVES AND PRISONERS FROM ALL THE FORMER TWENTY KINGDOMS TO BREAK THE POWER OF THE WORLD GOVERNMENT. WITH MORE PEOPLE JOINING THE WOLRD GOVERNMENT, THE GOROSEI WILL BE FORCED TO GO WAR WITH THEM LIKE THEY DID WITH THE ANCIENT KINGDOM 800 YRS BACK.


 Almost every villains in any anime would save their power for the very last episodes. They didn't go to Dragon directly because why would they waste their time when they have admirals, warlords and cipher pols to do their bidding. They didn't shit their pants about the clash between Shanks and Whitebeard but they only got a little panic because the balance of the pirate world would be in chaos thus causing the rest of the twenty kingdoms ( now the world government in general ) to lose trust in their power to maintain balance in the world. 


**Question: Why do some people say they are immortals who lived for 800 years and they are gonna be the final villian and every single one could stomp Roger or prime whitebeard?**

Ans:Remember the time when Jewelry got caught by the Blackbeard pirates ? Yea that's when the Gorosei had no choice but to call upon one of the admirals to get her back without harming her. Cause if she dies, bye bye to being ageless. The Gorosei have been there since the war with the Ancient Kingdom and they will do whatever it takes to keep the world government from crumbling apart. And they have been successful ever since with them destroying the entire island of Robin's homeland and the people with it. It is clear to the whole world that NO RESEARCHING OF THE VOID CENTURY SHOULD BE ALLOWED. The only people crazy enough to be doing that is Dragon and that is why they have to put him as the most dangerous man in the world with the highest bounty. 

And of course you might be asking me; why don't they just eliminate Dragon directly if they are that powerful ? Like Kaido and Big Mom, they never go to Luffy or anyone else to do the job instead. Proof ? Fishman island. Pekom and the other guy was there to look after the people to make sure that the place there is safe. So when Luffy was there and these two found out that Luffy are causing trouble by eating the candies ( when they're not ), Big Mom got panicked and angry and wanted to meet Luffy when the time comes. SHE DID NOT just go to Luffy and kill him ya see what I mean?


Every powerful boss in One Piece have always send their subordinates ( marine soldiers / crewmates ) to do their bidding for them right from the very beginning. That is why the Gorosei will forever stay put at their thrones, they will see to it that their soldiers will do a good job in keeping balance in this world without them having to do it. 



So yea, Luffy is currently the one that worry them the most seeing how he holds the will of the D ( the power that the Ancient Kingdom once has ) and Nico Robin the key figure to solving the whereabouts of the THREE ANCIENT POWERS just by reading the Poneglyphs. And the Gorosei are lucky because Luffy and the others didn't knew that 1/3 of the ancient weapons are already hidden within Poseidon, the mermaid Luffy's been talking to all that while. If Nico Robin found out about Poseidon bearing the power of the ancient weapon, the Gorosei would be FUCKED BIG TIME. 


*How did she possessed the ancient weapon's power? *

ANS: If Poseidon didn't cry out for help, those Sea Kings prob wouldn't hold the entire Noah Ship from falling towards the city and Luffy would have been punching the entire Ship into pieces. 










Bottom line: If the Gorosei had to do it themselves and go down to kill Luffy, that would basically mean they HAVE FAILED to use their power to control and ensure that marines, schibukais, cipher pols, celestial dragons are doing a good job. Its like playing chess, you move your soldiers first and finally the king and queen.

Bear with me....

Oda has kept that "joke" a bit too long for it to not be a part of his development.

Since the Thriller Bark Arc and his fight with Absalom, he has stated that he always had two big dreams. One is seeing the All Blue, while the second is to gain the power of invisibility.

Since the Vinsmoke family are essentially assassins, do you think the power of invisibility will be one of his "unleashed" powers (as a result of the genetic modifications)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always loved Sanji.

He was always one of my most favourite characters.

However, after the timeskip - the majority of his scenes became predicated on his pervert nature and blood loss. He was always a pervert, but I feel it has reached a point where it's harming his character.

Now that Sanji has lost everything - I would love it if this changes him permanently.

While Sanji falls in love with every woman he sees, Pudding was the only woman he has seriously decided to marry (through duress). I really hope Oda doesn't squander that level of heartbreak.

The year of Sanji might be over, but I hope his most epic moments are in 2017 - where he shows us a new ability.

Furthermore, I want Sanji to be FURIOUS. Not like the time he was angry at Absalom and he burst in flames - because that felt comedic.......but legitimately angry (similar to Luffy when punching the celestial dragon in Saboady).

How interesting would it be, Sanji no longer fawning over Nami and Robin as he used to. He still treats them like a lady, but the love hearts and nose bleeds are gone.

There was always more to his character than those quirks....

He's a part of the Monster trio - Luffy and Zoro have shown their strength....it's now Sanji's turn.

	<TEXT> I wasn't here when either series were airing, so I wanted to ask which you preferred; [Outbreak Company](https://myanimelist.net/anime/19369/Outbreak_Company) or [GATE](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28907/Gate__Jieitai_Kanochi_nite_Kaku_Tatakaeri).

In my opinion, I liked the premise of GATE a lot more - and while it did disappoint me.....I found it better than Outbreak.

While it never made sense why Itami was an Otaku, the pandering in Outbreak was a bit too unbearable.

I felt it was more believable for an army to enter another world rather than some random teenager. I'm pretty sure there are tons of adults working in the government who could do what Shinichi was chosen to do (propagate the Japanese culture).

	<TITLE> DISCUSSION: You become the CEO of WB and can only do five things regarding the DCEU, what would you do? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-19 14:47:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Those five decisions are permanent and can't be changed by subsequent CEO's of the company.

Here's my five;

1 - Begin plans for a multiple earth saga, allowing the DCEU actors to retire while still continuing the universe. This would allow new actors to fill the roles without effecting the canon of Earth One. However, the seeds must be sown in movies like the Flash before a story device like that could be employed.

2- Adapting the ["Green Lantern War"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjf0qe_-vzY) in a three part trilogy beginning in 2020. 

3 - Hiring Brad Bird for MoS 2.

4 - Creating a group of writers to control the way the DCEU flows. It should no longer be just Snyder's or any director's vision. Tonal inconsistencies really kill cinematic universes. These writers should be an amalgamation of the best and brightest at WB and DC comic writers. 


I guess you could call it the Round Table......

However, this doesn't mean the Director has no say in the movie. Once the writers and the Director share a vision, they can work together to make a cohesive film with absolutely no input from focus groups.

5 - Work with well known game studios like WB Montreal and Rocksteady Studios to create well made movie video games using the DCEU. 

Video games based on movies have always been shit because they don't give the devs enough time. The games wouldn't use the exact same plot of the movie, but would fill gaps made by the movies.

For example, a game of Affleck's Batman prior to BvS that is considered canon by the writers of the DCEU would create more fans and hype future projects. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> OPINION: Rogue One is what Suicide Squad should've been... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-16 13:43:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Now before I start, I would like to make a few clarifications;

- I'm not comparing Rogue One to SS in direction, editing, acting or even the script. My argument is regarding the premise of Rogue One, the tone it employed and how it succeeded where SS didn't.

- I will not spoil any plot points from the movie, so rest assured.


Back when David Ayer was announced as the director, many of us were very happy. Fury and End of Watch were not only amazing movies, but they fit well with the premise of the **Suicide** Squad.

The Suicide Squad, a group of **criminals** given the choice to complete a highly dangerous mission on the promise of a lower prison sentence. Using the criminals allows the government to carry out Black Ops/Wetwork missions without any association or danger to their operatives.

I am honestly in shock with how good the movie is, even up there with the orig trig. However, what really got me was how Rogue One was the SS I wanted all along.

Obviously the two movies are totally different, one is a fun and zany comic book movie while the other is a space opera with significant inspirations from Saving Private Ryan.

However, there are aspects to Rogue One that would've made SS an infinitely better movie;

1- The characters in Rogue One are morally bankrupt. They might be fighting for the resistance, but they are not "good guys". They kill people in cold blood. War, death and fighting is ugly - it's the reality. 

What makes SS a very awkward movie to sit through for me is just how **good** these villains are. These are some of the most horrible criminals in the DC Universe (except Diablo)....and yet you never feel like they truly are bad people. You're not meant to love these characters in the beginning, you should hate them. It's after they have gone through hell and back to stop an even worse criminal that the audience should start liking the group. Out of all the movies, **this** was the one movie where comedy should've been sparingly used (and only by characters like Harley or the Joker).

While we do see their crimes during their introduction, the tonal inconsistency of SS made it hard to take seriously.

MoS and BvS created this serious world where everything has a consequence, yet in SS - it felt like a totally different universe that doesn't complement it's predecessors nor help in consistent world building.

2 - In Rogue One, you never truly know whether someone will truly survive or not. They are on a suicide mission with very low probabilities of success - they could all die by the end of the movie and it wouldn't take away from the canon of the previous movies. Every single action scene has this sense of dread where any character could die in an instant. This constant fear makes you really care for the characters.

One of my biggest problems with SS was the death of Slipknot. Many people here laughed at me, why would you care for the literal red shirt in the movie? 

Due to his lack of scenes in the trailer, you already knew he would die - so why do you care?

It's because *I didn't care that I care*.

Bear with me...

Like all of the characters in SS, Slipknot was a blank slate. They could do absolutely anything with him. While it was easy to kill him in the first few minutes of the movie, why couldn't they choose the harder route of creating an interesting character that dies....not because of stupidity but real danger to the group's goals?

If they had avoided the multiple unnecessary introductions, they could've created interesting characters that don't need their backstories literally explained to you beat for beat. 

This is a personal opinion, but I would have kept Slipknot alive until the final confrontation, where it's his sacrifice that saves the team. This would allow WB to get rid of a character they couldn't do much with, while saving characters that could work in the second movie. 

[SS](#spoilers "The movie televised the death of characters earlier on, making it a case of "if" rather than "when". Now we are in a situation where the most interesting character in the movie is dead and we are all creating reasons for why he's really not.")

I see a a few people on this sub think that Disney just can't make a dark movie, or that it must have jokes/puns every time. 

Well Gareth Edwards did it.

I really hope Geoff Johns and WB can look at this movie and try to emulate it's successes in future DCEU movies.

In my opinion, a way to solve these studio problems is lowering the budget of SS 2 and other movies with lesser known characters.....keeping it down to earth and personal is the way to go. 

Why lower the budget?

Directors and studios are forced to be more creative and a lot more restrictive when the budget is lower.

Fury, a movie I consider Ayer's best - was made with a budget of 68 million dollars and yet looks more polished than most blockbuster movies.

With a lower budget, WB won't feel the need to constantly change the movie in a desperate bid to make it likeable.

	<TITLE> What trope drives you up the wall? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What anime trope gets you so annoyed, you just want to punch the screen?

For me, it's a very prevalent trope - almost seen in every single anime;

Characters hitting the MC for some stupid reason.

This has always annoyed me, but I realised just how bad it was when I was watching a One Piece episode just recently.

Prior to the timeskip, it was kinda funny when Nami would hit Luffy over his stupidity, since he really was an idiot. [One Piece](/s "However, after reaching the New World, losing his brother, training for two years and becoming stronger - these scenes make no sense anymore.")

The getting injured schtick just messes with the story, tone, characterisation and overall canon.

That's when I realised, the amount of hatred I have for the trope.

Even if the MC does the most messed up thing, hitting them is not the answer (for a multitude of reasons that are obvious enough to be kept unsaid). 

It's why [Re:Zero/Episode 13](/s "episode 13 of Re: Zero amazed me so much. Here was an MC who was getting the punishment for what he said, not by slapping and forgetting - but by getting his heart ripped out with words.") 

Anime characters think a slap suffices when a character does something as stupid as peeking in an occupied bathroom or touching their breasts, when in real life.....that could effect your whole relationship and can even cause legal complications. 

Then there's female characters who hit the MC for no goddamn reason, which annoys me even more.....

I've gone on a huge tangent.

So, what drives you up the wall?

	<DATE> 2016-12-14 13:34:21 </DATE>

	<TEXT> The whole point why Orm becomes a villain in the Aquaman stories is due to the succession of the Atlantean throne. He doesn't believe Arthur Curry deserves the throne when he has been governing alongside his father for all those years.

This causes the fued, ending with Orm losing and Arthur being crowned King of Atlantis.

However, since in the DCEU - Arthur is already a king.....what would be the conflict?

Would he be in jail after a failed coup?

Is he still a "good" character that turns "bad" during the Aquaman movie or will he already be an outright villain as Ocean Master? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What kind of anime fan are you? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-13 14:18:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've always been curious when it comes to this topic;

What kind of anime fan are you?

I'm a fan who started watching anime in 2007/08.

I have watched so much anime, I have forgotten the majority of them. I think they could reach the 200-300 mark - it's that or I am seriously overestimating the number of shows I've watched.

Sometimes, the only hint I've watched a series already is a weird feeling of deja vu I experience at around the 2nd or 3rd episode - which I then realise means I've watched it already.

I've never been someone who buys merchandise or shows his outright love of the medium by cosplaying, nor was I really embarrassed to discuss it in school with friends.

A really funny moment I can recall is when I first heard about Naruto. Two friends of mine were discussing an episode and since I didn't know what the hell they were saying.....my brain interpreted what they said very differently.

For almost two weeks prior to finally watching it, I thought characters in Naruto had guns in their eyes.

Sharin - gun

Byaku - gun.

I thought Hinata and Sasuke were ninja cyborgs who had turrets for an eye, dishing out powerful magic from them.

When I first started watching, I was obsessed with harem anime. I guess for an overweight 14 year old, it was a great way to escape school life, studies and bullying.

It was Infinite Stratos that made me rage quit the genre, the idiocy of the MC ruined it for me. It could no longer be an escape, since I had realised none of them acted like a normal person. It was tiring, harem shows always go back to the status quo....which annoyed young me.

Now, anime is a weird on and off thing for me.

When I am on, I watch 10-15 shows in consecutive fashion. While in the off season, I avoid anime and just watch American/Korean TV shows.

There's always 2-3 shows every year that get me back into anime. 

This year it was Boku no Hero, ~~One Punch~~ and Re:Zero.

Last year it was Rokka no Yuusha, One Punch, Overlord, Prison School and Gangsta.

2014 was Shirogane no Ishi and Aldnoah Zero....you get the drift.

*What are my all time favourite anime?*

My mind's blank, there's too many.

One that automatically comes to mind however is Gintama.






I really do apologise for the long post.

Now that I've hopefully shown the type of fan I am, I would love to hear from anyone willing to share;

**What kind of anime fan are you?**

**Edit**:  /u/Riptos007 's comment reminded me that I was exposed to anime at a much younger age. How could I forget watching Pokemon, Yu Gi Oh and DBZ every morning on TV before going to Kindergarten (around the year 2000)? 

I guess that means I rediscovered anime....

"This is AMAZING"

".....Yeah, but I'm worried that they showed us too much"

"I'm so thankful for Snyder's hardwork, but a second trailer in 2016 when the movie releases in 2017 was a bad idea.

"Is it just me or is the CGI horrible?"

"That's because the CGI is unfinished, I'm sure it will be completed closer to release, they still got a lot of time."

"Now that we got the first official trailer, when are we getting the second? February 2017?"

"Eh Maybe".

	<TITLE> What anime had a great premise but disappointed you in the end? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-11 14:56:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think for me, it will always be **Zero No Tsukaima**.

It was one of the first few anime I had watched and the premise was great.

I really wanted to see Saito become an incredibly powerful magician in his own right and climb up the ranks of the kingdom, instead - we got the stupid love story between him and Louise.

I had originally thought that the constant torture would make him snap and leave her.....since she had absolutely no redeeming qualities.

I mean, you were once an average citizen with a boring life and now you have all the power in the world and a plethora of women have fallen in love with you (including the ruler of the Kingdom).....why would you still stay in school as the pet/familiar of a girl who beats you constantly?

I also thought he would take advantage of the knowledge he has from his life in our world to create weapons ie (trebuchets, guns, grenades etc).

What angered me the most, is that he didn't free Siesta from being a slave/maid (even though she's part Japanese and he had the money/power to help a friend), didn't use Jean's knowledge to learn more about the world or create new weapons/inventions using his knowledge from our world (they did create petrol) and didn't leave Louise even after becoming a Lord (he's still a glorified pet in the eyes of Louise).

Saito is never shown to miss his parents/friends and hardly stands up for himself until the plot says he can.

The show still has a place in my heart as one of the first anime I had watched in my youth, but I think Le Blanc de La Vallire Louise Franoise is the worst female in anime  and the show as a whole is a waste of a great premise.

	<TEXT> A debate on which is the better movie, **Batman v Superman** or **Suicide Squad**.

The twist is, you must argue the *opposite* of what you truly think.

While I think both movies are extremely flawed, I think BvS is leaps and bounds better than SS.

So I would have to argue for SS and against BvS for which is the better movie.

I'll start;

- Suicide Squad is better than BvS for it's accurate portrayal of government officials. Amanda Waller is an absolutely vicious character that hearkens to America's foreign policy post 9/11.

- I think Davis' portrayal was top notch.

- Batman v Superman's portrayal of politicians was sorely lacking. While Senator Finch's naivete was refreshing, the reality is - no real politician would decline an opportunity to control a mysterious alien with the powers of a god. Especially one with ambiguous intentions and loyalties....

- While she is a country girl (being from Kentucky), I just don't buy a politician who has reached the highest levels of government, could be so naive as to decline an offer from the most powerful man in Metropolis and expect to survive the ordeal (both politically and...physically).

- With the current political climate of the world, characters like Senator Finch wouldn't exist - which is why I commend the existence of Amanda Waller.

	<TITLE> Is Oda over hyping Shanks? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-07 07:54:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was rewatching the Marineford arc when I came across [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0sIQ7rZjFY) conversation between Blackbeard and Shanks.

While stopping the war, Shanks challenged Blackbeard to fight him.

When I first watched it, I just saw it as an awesome scene showing Shanks' strength as a Yonko.

However, now that I think about it -why wouldn't Blackbeard be ready to fight?

He has two devil fruit powers, he's *relatively* undamaged and his crew aren't pushovers.

 It was a great chance for Blackbeard, using the marine intervention to his advantage (Garp would've joined the fight, dragging Sengoku and the rest of the marines into a three way).

From that interaction, is it possible to infer that even with his powers, it's unlikely for him to win against Shanks?

I've heard some theories of Shanks eating a devil fruit that stops time after leaving Luffy (similar to Foxy) or an advanced haki technique, which would explain how he reached Marineford so quickly after fighting Kaido a few days before.

Do you think Oda is just hyping fans too much or do you think Shanks is just that strong.

I just hope Oda delivers, or it would be worse than Kubo messing up the Zero Squad in Bleach. </TEXT>

Isn't it time for DC to wake up and make a Amazon/Netflix TV show with street level characters that have a low chance of being in the DCEU but would be extremely popular.

A high quality show using a character like Cassandra or Dick would allow them to introduce these characters to the extended universe, while also avoiding the inevitably long explanations of their backstory if they were in the movies alone.

A TV show about Clark's grandfather in Krypton doesn't scratch that itch......

Come on DC.......take the plunge.

Dick's city of operations is Bludhaven.....avoiding any clash with Batman.

Cassandra's base of operations are New York, Hong Kong, Bludhaven and Tibet - she also avoids stepping on the toes of the current movie characters.....while enriching the world of the DCEU. </TEXT>

Perhaps Desmond had a love child who grew up and we would play him, or a brother/sister of his we haven't heard about.

	<TEXT> I don't want Justin Kurzel to change the vision of his movie, but they have an amazing opportunity to be creative in the trailers and advertisements.


The trailers haven't been great for the movie.
People love Assassins Creed because it uses history to weave interesting stories around a fantastical ancient battle between Assassins and Templars.


Not many people know what 15th century Spain looks like, shouldn't they showcase it in the trailers? 

In almost all AC games, the locations are characters as well.


**AC 1**: Masyaf, Demascus, Jerusalem and Acre


**AC 2**: Florence, Monteriggioni, San Gimignano, Venice and Rome.


**AC Brotherhood**: Roman districts (Vatican, Central, Trans-Tiber, Campagna and Antico.


**AC Revelations**: Masyaf, Constantinople districts (Constantine, Bayezid, Imperial, Galata and Cappadocia) during Ottoman rule.


**AC 3**: Boston, New York, Philadelphia and "The Frontier" during the American revolution.


**AC 4**: Havana, Kingston and Nassau during Spanish colonisation and the era of Pirates.


**AC Unity**: Paris and Versailles


**AC Syndicate**: Victorian era London.

I just hope they could give us an amazing ad like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjQ6ZtyXoA0), or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYgV0o3_T9Q), or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMsbMK9Odoc)........or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T97uzpaY3Fs).

I think taking advantage of the virtual nature of the animus can create breathtaking trailers that don't spoil the movie.

	<TITLE> [BvS] If you were the director,what would you do differently in the Knightmare scene. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-17 17:18:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I asked myself the question, if I was the director of BvS - how would I do the Knightmare scene?

I thought about it long and hard, and came up with the following;

The Knightmare scene would be the backbone of the DCEU's first major story arc.

The first half of the movie would have the knightmare scene in a weird and jarring edit that mimics the discombobulation of a real dream.

Bruce wakes up, visually upset and afraid. 

I want the audience to know that he saw something horrible, but can't put their finger on what it is. All we know at this point is that Batman is in a desert and is now chained in a cave. In the Batcave, paper is strewn everywhere and all the Bat computers are busted. All that Bruce can do is scream for Alfred - ensuring his safety.

Alfred comes in worried and looks at the floor - written on a piece of paper in blood is;

 **DEFCON** **1** **SUPER'**  [(') is a notation for "Prime"]

At this point in time, Bruce has no idea what's happening and presumes that the Batcave was infiltrated - either by the Joker or another enemy. Near the end of the movie, Bruce repairs the Bat cave and his computers - he looks for the CCTV recording to see what happened.

Finally, we see the Flash.

The second the portal opens, Bruce gets knocked out (It can be explained in the Flash solo that the Speed Force is trying to prevent a grandfather paradox). 

Barry's suit is all torn up, and as he struggles against the Speed Force pushing him back....he screams;

**"BRUCE, HE'S COMING"** - Cut to black

I want the rest of the CCTV footage to be left to the imagination. I feel in this case, the implications of the message in blood is better left to the imagination. As the hypothetical director, I would want people to realise that Barry was so desperate to leave the message that he made himself bleed in whatever gory way your brain conjures up.

Now, here is where it gets interesting.

A credit scene at the end of the movie, almost identical to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6as8ahAr1Uc)

Except, it's not Cavill.

This Superman looks different, he has red and black armour in a similar design to Zod's armour.

He takes off Bruce's cowl and utters one line.

*"Darkseid sends his regards"*

The movie ends.

This is not Superman.

This is [Superboy Prime](http://imgur.com/a/VbqCt), herald of Darkseid and his strongest elite.

This would set off a large story that would introduce the DC multiverse, Brainiac, Apokolips, the Kryptonian city of Kandor, Darkseid, the Female Furies and the Green Lantern Corps. 

After Steppenwolf's failure in conquering Earth in JL, Darkseid decides to use his most trusted general, Prime. In MoS II, after Brainiac is defeated and Kandor is returned to it's original size - we find out that Jor El was experimenting on creating the perfect Kryptonian soldier by altering genes in the Codex.

According to a Kandorian elder, the experiment failed and Jor-El realised that it was not a good idea to push further. Super Boy Prime comes from a universe where Jor El was successful and his actions caused a civil war. Krypton Clone #30 was the only person to survive and escaped with a damaged airship, found 10 years later by Granny Goodness.

Under Darkseid, Prime became one of the most feared names in the multiverse. He has annihilated multiple races, planets and eliminated 10 percent of the Green Lantern Corps before being stopped by the Guardians

His appearance in the DCEU would show just how strong Darkseid truly is, that one of his Elite generals poses an insurmountable threat to the entire JL. It would raise the stakes of Darkseid reaching Earth...his appearance almost guaranteeing the extinction of mankind.

Darkseid arriving on Earth should be a Phase Two movie, where multiple heroes from across the universe help in thwarting him.

It would also open up the DCEU, introducing more Kryptonians (including Zara who was trapped in Kandor).

Sorry for the long read :D </TEXT>

Batman already has detective lenses built in to his tech cowl from BvS.

We even see it in the Ultimate Edition during the painfully short scene where Batman infiltrates Lexcorp.

So why are people so excited?

Batman: "Yes, you will be training under me."

New Robin: "Cool"

*Robin sees the [old costume](http://imgur.com/a/t9rid) with the really short shorts, chains and a [concrete area that looks like a dungeon](http://imgur.com/a/N7sXH).*

New Robin: "A reclusive billionaire that runs around in a rubber suit and has a secret cave under his house.....why am I not surprised?"

Batman: (   )

Robin: (   )

If you are planning to use him in the movie, keep it as a quick post credits scene.

Leave the glory of Deathstroke and Batman's rogues to the solo film.

Just focus on the Justice League, Steppenwolf and the parademons....you already have a lot on your plate. </TEXT>

SSJ 1: Lightning, waves crashing and small rocks rising.

SSJ 2: Lightning, strong gusts of wind, mountains destroyed.

SSJ3: A whole city shaking and losing electricity.

With the new saiyan transformations, It just doesn't feel the same.

You would think SSJG and SSJGSSJ would have an even larger effect on the environment around them.

While I do like DB Super, it just doesn't have the same epic feeling as it used to have.

For me, nothing will ever compare to when I first saw Goku turning super saiyan - the transformations no longer have weight or importance.

Even though people hate GT, Goku's transformation to SS4 was amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Disclaimer: I'm not talking about ALL the fans that frequent this sub but a small group I've noticed.**

After BvS was released, a lot of DCEU fans hated the word "fun".

They adamantly believed that the universe should stay it's darker course........as they felt the movies were more "unique" than the "generic crap" being created by Marvel.

Now that SS has released, they are so happy at how fun and enjoyable it was.......even though WB essentially used the same formula that has worked for Marvel.

The **same** formula they criticised. 

- Weak villain -  check.

- Villain wants to destroy the world for some stupid reason - check.

- A minion army of grey, bland looking enemies for the team to fight - check.

- The villain unleashes a pillar of light that shoots straight up into the sky - check.

- Quips and funny lines exchanged between members of the team - check.

- A mid credit scene - check.

I'm not trying to bad mouth the movie, it's just funny that a lot of DCEU fans shit on Marvel.......and here is WB essentially trying the same thing.

The difference is - those fans call SS "unique and fun" and Marvel movies "generic and bland".

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I understand that Ayer and WB were trying to make a fun blockbuster movie - but did anyone find the music SUPER cringy?

The music made the scenes feel like really bad music videos.

I personally think the acid bath scene was the worst.

Here you have a very iconic and frankly heart breaking story of a psychologist who was tortured and manipulated by the Joker.....and needs to jump into a bath of chemicals for her to be accepted by him. 

For a scene like that, using Steven Price's score is the obvious choice, but they didn't.

They used ["Gangster"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBheebFpps) - a song I would expect to see in a [fan made tribute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnHx_CcRsW0) on Youtube.

The song choices weren't bad, but it severely hampered the tone of the movie.

It reminded me of the "edgy" 00s - where scenes like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBbD5SCND3M) from Daredevil and other movies were common place.

The music used in GOTG worked because it had a narrative purpose....it was a mixtape given to Starlord by his mother.

They didn't overuse it, and it didn't effect the portrayal of the scene.

The Joker and Harley's relationship doesn't warrant a romantic R B song.

Now, don't get me wrong - some of the music choices worked......but **for me**, the majority didn't.

I'm not saying that she won't be badass in her movie - but the music doesn't suit the time period (circa 1914) and the character at that point in time.

While the theme is welcome in JL and future movies on the slate - they should restrict the usage to perhaps once or twice at the end of the movie (end credits or the final battle).

WW is approximately 5000 years old, however - her first outing in man's world was only about 100 years ago.

Does that mean armour created by Amazonians deteriorates after only a hundred years?


To Amazonians, 100 years would have the same significance as a year of a normal human.

TLDR; Why would armour made by the gods/immortals deteriorate so much after only 100 years?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> According to /u/AbsolutelyN0body - Justice League's sequel will be called [](#spoilers "Justice League Part Deux: Revenge of Super Slipknot.")

Now hear me out.

Slipknot is an integral character to the DCEU and his longevity is guaranteed.

However, every villain meets his/her doom.

Slipknot sadly dies in **Suicide Squad II: Live Free or Suicide Hard** from an attempted hanging.

Luckily, Slipknot - who is immune to rope burns miraculously survives with his head intact.

This event scarred him mentally and caused him to leave the Justice League.

Years later, we find out Braniac paid Harkness 40 cakes (and a pink unicorn body pillow) to try and kill Slipknot. 

Upon finding this, our lord and saviour Slipknot was driven mad and became the enemy......

Reverse Slipknot 

#Knotslip

The hanging gave him +500 attack points, meaning he became the **Super Knotslip/Slipknot Supreme**.

- WB has confirmed the director of the Slipknot trilogy (Uwe Boll) will be helming JL 2.

- Hayden Christensen has been cast as Braniac.

- Academy Award winner Adam Beach will reprise his role as Christopher Weiss/Slipknot.

- Tommy Wiseau has been cast as extra #666

The movie will be released on the 30th of February 2018 </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The rumours of the Batman movie being set in Arkham Asylum </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A few days ago, there were rumours circling that Affleck's Batman movie would be set in Arkham - and while it's a very cool idea.....shouldn't be the direction they take.


I really think the movie should focus on Gotham as a whole.

Since Batman has been operating for twenty years, I would like a deeper focus on the actual city from both Batman and Bruce's point of views.

Arkham Asylum is a great place to explore, but I feel it could work better in Suicide Squad 2.

We are still not familiar with Gotham or how Batman operates and I think it would be a waste to focus only on the Asylum.

I would love the Court of Owls story to also be weaved in - Bruce beginning a big project to revitalise Gotham and getting the attention of the court as a result.

Seeing Bruce balance his life as Batman and a responsible CEO would also be cool. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really hope the Flash's abilities aren't as powerful as Quicksilver's in *X-men Apocalypse*.

In the comics, Quiksilver can only reach speeds of up to Mach 10 (supersonic) - while Flash can run at the speed of light.

However, after seeing the movie......I realise that the Flash being that powerful can ruin the movie.

I think it might be a good decision to make him a bit weaker or to create an explanation which limits his power.

If Flash is too fast, the general audience and even fans will ask why the Flash couldn't save the day.....since he can run at lightspeed - making it very hard to create an ensemble movie.

[Quiksilver became a Deus ex machina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LIcOFvWqjk), I hope Snyder and Terrio avoid that.

A possible limit could be that his inability to control his powers destroys the things around him as he runs......therefore limiting his usage.

Or stating that his crazy high metabolism needs him to constantly eat - otherwise causing hunger and no energy.

What does Batman do?

He first conspicuously flies in loudly with the Bat plane (alerting KG Beast) and shoots two mercenaries and two trucks.

Alfred takes control of the Batplane

Alfred has thermal vision confirming 24 thugs on the first floor.

On that same floor is KG Beast holding Martha hostage with a flamethrower.

The arrangement being that if Superman or *anyone else* tried to save her - he should automatically burn her to a crisp.

Batman then proceeds to fight the 24 thugs for a total of two minutes and nine seconds.

Look, I get that Snyder and co wanted a cool Batman scene for the movie - and I do admit it's one of the more cooler scenes from the movie....

However, when you take into account that Batman has;

- been operating for twenty years.

- has encountered numerous hostage situations.

- has trained with numerous masters in the art of martial arts and stealth.

Why would he go about saving her in such a loud and dangerous way?

[She's right there!](https://imgur.com/So4reRa)

All Batman needed to do was either save her from the second level below by doing the same thing he did with the thugs (blowing a hole in the first floor and disengaging their weapons) or save her via the window.

KG Beast was a very formidable and highly competent villain throughout the movie until he was written not to be. If the movie followed the logical conclusion - KG Beast would've burned Martha the instant he heard the commotion and escape.

Luthor, who has shown to be an evil and meticulous person - exploding the Capitol building to avoid blow back........doesn't have a backup plan which ensures Martha isn't saved (the important leash needed for Superman to fight Batman)

I've already accepted the fact that this post will be down voted and considered nitpicking, but I wanted to share my opinion and hopefully engage in some discussion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a lot of people here who believe that KG Beast was the sole cause of the explosion.

They believe that after Batman had shot the tank of gas, KG Beast tried to shoot Martha and thus the cause of the explosion.

THIS IS WRONG.

Batman is **the** only person at fault for the explosion, **directly** responsible for the death of Anatoly and the endangerment of Martha.

Why?

Flame throwers don't work like a normal gun. They work similar to a pesticide sprayer.

There is a large tank of gas you carry on your back and an open flame that is not controlled by the user. The flame is there whether you pull the trigger or not.

By pulling the trigger, a torrent of gas mixes with the small naked flame, creating the stream of fire you associate with flame throwers.

I created an album to illustrate my explanation.

http://imgur.com/a/a8DtP

- As you can see, the flame was active even before Batman arrived in the room.

- Batman arrives and aims the gun at KG Beast.

- KG Beast screams that he will kill her if he wasn't left alone.

- Batman proceeds to shoot the tank.

- The escaped gas get exposed to the flame and everything explodes.

As you can see, there are two conclusions that can be made from this.

1- KG Beast did not try to kill Martha, nor did he ever pull the trigger.

2- Batman, even after seeing the open flame of the fire thrower - shot at the tank.



**Batman is the killer of KG Beast.**

The movie was released in 2007 as a "direct to video" and was directed by Bruce Timm, Lauren Montgomery and Brandon Vietti.

It adapted the infamous "Death of Superman" story line, focusing on his fight with Doomsday.

Since BvS used many aspects of this comic story as well, it would be cool to discuss similarities and differences.

A small complaint I have always had with any death scene of Bruce's beloved family is that he's always stoic and quiet. You never see him breakdown, cry or even shed tears.

Bruce Wayne is a strong character, but he should always be seen as a human......who can show sadness and remorse for a few moments when it matters most for the movie's emotional punchline.

TLDR; Batman doesn't cry in any media (except for [this](https://youtu.be/XCbr9_DUE3E?t=30)), would you like a sad scene in the DCEU where that happens?

Edit: In hindsight, the title sounds very mean - but I meant it as paying to see the movie. </TEXT>
