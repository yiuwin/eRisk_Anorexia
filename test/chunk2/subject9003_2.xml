This is a response to the post that you responded to:
I think the idea of GoPro edits is a little silly, but it doesn't restrict the content you as an individual create. In fact, if you go another route, your content may actually be more valuable. The average skier doesn't take the time to stop, take there backpack off, and snag a picture of there buddy on there slr anymore. 

You find meaning through use, not ostensive propositions. Go create or promote what you like instead of complaining. /end argument  </TEXT>

My chiropractor described the issue to me. He said one of the cervical vertebra was pinching the main nerve going up the neck and across the top of the head. He said it can be caused by my form. 

A lot of people tend to keep stress in there head and hold there breath. This is bad. I find that when I contract my abdominals and stare blankly at an unmoving object in front of me, the tension in my neck/head dissipates. </TEXT>

I still feel like working out sober is better. It helps me build up some focus out of the gym, gives me energy for the rest of the day, and give me a sense of accomplishment. I can't say any of those things for weed. I'm too young to be so stuck on a plant. There are so many things I want to do and none of those things involve a substance. Weed will show up in my life by virtue. For some reason weed just finds me. But never the less, I enjoy weed and always will.  </TEXT>

Lets not worry about the issues of the runway models, starving children in Africa, or junkies in Europe. We need to address our own issues before we can be completely morally obligated to the problems of others. We use the problems of others as an outlet for ourselves so often that we forget that we are struggling ourselves.

Before someone gets upset over what I just said, I was using some rhetoric to bring home an idea. We can obviously multitask and help out those in need while helping ourselves. But don't use charity to run away from your own issues.  </TEXT>

We can also assume ducks are less dense than humans (they are birds (hollow bones and what not)). Lets make another assumption that the average cheerleader weighs 120lbs. 

A cheerleader sized duck is definitely preferable to the mini cheerleaders. Another bonus to the duck is it's larger platform (feet).

	<TEXT> Exercise helps me in a few places, but therapy has really helped me as a whole. Working out can be a great stepping stone though. It's easy to set an objective fitness goal and force yourself to do it. You are then rewarded with more energy and confidence.

For me, depression stemmed from my anxiety. My manorexia then stemmed from depression. The depression and eating disorder fell into place pretty quickly and it became a part of me. I went from that anxious kid to the skinny sad anxious kid in the matter of weeks. My friends accepted it and so did I. 

So I graduated High School early, moved across the country, and went inpatient for the eating disorder. That big and sudden change (I decided to do all this about two weeks before I was on the plane) was half the battle for me. I was now in a position where I could be a different person. This is just an observation but, the less depressed I am the less I identify as that depressed kid. 

Being almost a year after I made my big change I can definitely say I am not depressed. I do have my lows, but I think much less about suicide, restricting my food, or sleeping. 

Beyond the big change in environment, therapy has guided helped guide me. My therapist is great at challenging me. I think everyone can benefit from therapy as long as they are truly willing to be open. 

Tl;dr 
I changed my environment and therapy helps.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the issue is language?

Objective statements are always relative to something (axioms, objects, events, etc.). We just don't admit this relative objective reality in language because of contexts. 

When someone says "I need water", the observer can infer the objective goal of the statement based on contexts. So that statement may actually read "I need water to quench my thirst". Wouldn't the context support our desire to remain in the same location when we travel through time? 

The question in the title is rhetorical.

*what follows is the remainder of my comment that was written some time after the preceding part.*

I get the idea that the OP was just being clever with this thread. It is interesting none the less, but we rarely think about the transcendent idea in a statement. We are always so quick to dismiss the idea's hidden contexts, yet we rely so heavily on the hidden contexts. Imagine if de facto was concerned only with the tangible grammar. For me it's fun to think about such things. We communicate in very complex (or as I like to say, dynamic ) forms.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you want to die? Or do you not like where you are (mentally, physically, and emotionally)?

Honestly, no one cares what mental disorders you have or your history. I have my fair share of issues and I identified with my issues too much. I was thinking way too much about my issues and it showed. I never made any attempts, but fantasized about suicide. I thought about how nice it would be to not be anymore. I don't know what changed for me, but I stopped surrounding myself with negative thoughts. I stopped identifying with my issues. With this sudden shift, I slowly stopped fantasizing about death. 

I'm not telling you to do anything or giving you answers. It's just my anecdote. I still have my issues, but they have a lesser effect on me. I walk with my issues

I hope you find whatever you're looking for. 

P.S. If you haven't already, consider therapy. My therapist has helped me more than anyone on my road to recovery than anyone/thing. The unexamined life is not worth living.  </TEXT>

This battle for legitimacy kinda shows more of the accuser than the violator.  I guess older people can have low self esteem too. I have always viewed my elders as emotionally ideal beings. Over the past year or two I have been trying to come to terms with this and take action. I'm not gonna wake up one morning and be an *adult*. /minimanifesto </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have 26 chickens! 24 hens and two roosters. We ordered our through a catalog and they were shipped to use (I'm not pulling you leg). Do some research online for breeds and buying supplies.

We had been switching every week with our neighbor's chickens for a year until we decided to get our own little fluff balls this October. They arrived about a day after they hatched and we kept them inside for 6~ weeks. 

I recommend keeping them inside and interacting with them on a daily basis. Chickens are pretty stupid animals, but they you can train them. We put them out in our barn when they grew enough feathers to tolerate ~45*F. 

We have three heat lamps set up on a timer and they seem happy. When you convert your shed remember this, **INSULATION**. Keeping the hot air in can keep the temperature from fluctuating too much (chickens don't like that) and gives you peace of mind. We use hay bales on the inside perimeter of the coop and hay on the floors. We are thinking of ways to insulate the roof, but we have the wiring for the heat lamps on the roof (i.e. avoiding fire hazards).


All in all, chickens are chalked full of character and super easy to own. For specific information on backyard chickens do some research on the internet and go to the book store. </TEXT>

Obama is not working for his reelection anymore, so I think we should find a way to support Obama in making the choice that is conducive to legalizing cannabis. I do not know how we can do this, but we should look at Obama's personal interests. Does he want to strengthen relationships with the Justice Department? Democratic Party? his dog? Are his interests financial?

It irritates me when someone looks on the internet for a recipe (unless it is baking). You do not assemble a dish, you create it. Nine times out of ten the recipe sucks or they did something wrong (forgot something, substituted milk for buttermilk, or took creative liberty to the wrong thing).

	<TEXT> Try body weight exercises in the morning before you go skiing. Pull ups, push ups, dips,  and any variations of each. Lightly stretch and go shred. If you are concerned about losing weight than of course try and eat more. It's best to tell yourself now that you will lose some weight. Even if you don't lose weight, just keep saying that. Do your best and don't worry about it. You're going on an awesome trip and you're gonna have a blast. Some things just aren't worth and stressing over a few pounds is definitely not worth it. 

Oh yeah, be safe. An injury will certainly not help you retain your muscle or have fun.  


One more thing, there was a thread on newschoolers a few days ago about weight training and skiing. It turned into a shit storm like most threads there, but you might get some inspiration.  </TEXT>
