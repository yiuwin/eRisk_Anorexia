	<TEXT> Hmm being a bitch to them seems to work for me and I'm 4'11 and 95 lbs. I just read all these Letsnotmeet stories and get frustrated when women answer gross personal questions. Like I'd get pissed fly off but my dad raised me to not take any shit from a man. Btw array mace and a switchblade, you'll feel more confident. I guess my concern is letting them take advantage of your fear. They prey on it  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A white 2001 Camero that had been pulled out of a pond. My dad paid 500$ for it. The windows didn't roll down and the dash lights were lit like a Christmas tree, but it ran until I totaled it!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just asked my 26 yr old male roommate who is the typical alpha male this question, and he nonchalantly said "I'd just be able to be myself I guess". Wow he said so much about society with saying very little. I think his subconscious answered for him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every time I read these stories with creepy men women ALWAYS rationalize their creepy behavior and are still nice to them, and answer their creepy questions. This is dangerous and can lead to sexual assault. Your gut feeling is almost always right, it's your innate animal instinct that all creatures have that keep them safe. Women need to be a tough bitch, it will keep you safe. Don't worry about their feelings, they are harrassing you. 
No one ever seems to bother me because I intentionally have bitch face that says don't bother me, and I'm a 95 lb 4'11 woman. You gotta carry yourself strong. Men prey off of fear. This is a fact. They sense your uneasiness and think you'll be an easy target. I hope I didn't come off bitchy. I just want women to be safe :). Carry a switchblade OP!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oscar Schindler saving over 1000 Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his safe factories where they always had a meal, no death and were treated with dignity. He was a millionaire Nazi and spent his entire fortune trying to keep them safe. There are over 8000 jews that were born the past generations. They're called Schindler Jews. He fled to South America a poor man and never got real recognition. But the Jews he saved supported him after the war. I know there is the movie Schindlers List but most people haven't seen it and I didn't learn about him in school growing up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those are the best! Playground day. I always loved swinging, even when I was alone. Feeling the wind rush past and everything is quiet. I still go to playgrounds when I'm feeling nostalgic and just sit in the swings </TEXT>
