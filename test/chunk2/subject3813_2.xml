	<TEXT> a mix of non iodized kosher sea salt and water, heated in the microwave for about 15 seconds. soak a paper towel in the hot salt water and let the wet paper towel sit on the piercing for 5 minutes. do this twice a day until it is healed, for a month or two. don't play with it! that's how bacteria gets to it. 

source: 20 piercings, including 2 conch.
good luck! </TEXT>
