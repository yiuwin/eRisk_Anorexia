**Today:**

We're trying something new in /r/AskHistorians.

Readers here tend to like the open discussion threads and questions that allow a multitude of possible answers from people of all sorts of backgrounds and levels of expertise. The [most popular thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dv49y/tt_youre_at_a_party_the_people_around_you_find/) in this subreddit's history, for example, was about questions you dread being asked at parties -- over 2000 comments, and most of them were very interesting!

So, we do want to make questions like this a more regular feature, but we also don't want to make them TOO common -- /r/AskHistorians is, and will remain, a subreddit dedicated to educated experts answering specific user-submitted questions. General discussion is good, but it isn't the primary point of the place.

With this in mind, from time to time, one of the moderators will post an open-ended question of this sort. It will be distinguished by the "Feature" flair to set it off from regular submissions, and the same relaxed moderation rules that prevail in the daily project posts will apply. We expect that anyone who wishes to contribute will do so politely and in good faith, but there is far more scope for speculation and general chat than there would be in a usual thread.

We hope to experiment with this a bit over the next few weeks to see how it works. Please let us know via the mod mail if you have any questions, comments or concerns about this new endeavour!

=-=-=-=-=-=

**Today's question** is simple enough: what are some books, articles or analytical practices/lenses/etc. that either have or had a reputation that is not, for some reason, deserved?  Feel free to go in any direction you like with this, whether critical or redemptive.

So, all of the following are on the table:

- Books or articles with theses that turned out (innocently or otherwise) to be incorrect.

- Research that was selectively presented, massaged, or entirely fabricated.

- Works that gained influence for reasons other than the merits of their research -- e.g. they were unusually eloquent, or they fit into a compelling cultural zeitgeist, or they were written by That Person, etc.

- Works that have justly been discredited, for any reason.

- Alternately, works that currently languish in obscurity or suffer from opprobrium, but which you think deserve better than they're getting. 

While this is a more casual thread in keeping with its Floating Feature status, please ensure that all top-level comments are thorough, thoughtful, charitable, and accurate.  The standard rules of civility and conduct otherwise apply throughout the thread.

Let's see what you've got. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What are some poorly-represented or neglected aspects of the war in film, literature, art, etc.? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-24 14:28:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently had cause to comment on the lack of representations in modern film and television productions of the Zeppelin/Gotha campaign over England during the war.  Another user helpfully reminded me that we can see some traces of it in the film *Hell's Angels*, but it still seems instructive to me that we have to leap back to **1930** to find something like that.

And so I wonder: what aspects of the war seem to remain persistently absent from artistic engagements with it?  Is there a particular event you'd like to see?  Particular people?  A theatre of operations that has remained largely untreated in art?  Or maybe even an abstract idea that is never really communicated properly, if at all?

Anyone who wishes to reply is welcome to!  Please make sure your comments are thoughtful, polite, and open for discussion if any should arise. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [The regular weekly free-for-all thread will return shortly, and on a more coherently weekly schedule!]

Though the 100th anniversary of the main events in 1914 that led to the war's outbreak are still some months away, we are now concretely in 2014 -- the hundredth year since the initial commencement of the First World War.  This is going to be an absolutely momentous year when it comes to both academic and popular engagement with the war, and it's possible that people will be quite thoroughly sick of it by the time 2018 rolls around.

In the meantime, though, 2014 will be a time of massive international engagement with the war and its legacy.  Many governments, universities, historical associations, military regiments and others have their own plans for how to approach it -- but what are yours?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As you've no doubt discovered while reading the questions and answers offered in /r/AskHistorians, in a bid to keep the focus off of current events (and, moreover, current politics) we have chosen to enact a not-always-elegant and not-always-total ban on discussions of events that had taken place less than 20 years ago.  Up until yesterday, that cut us off at the end of 1993 -- but no longer.

***1994 is now open for business!***

And what a year it was!  Here are some of the highlights:

- Designated by the United Nations as the *International Year of the Family* and the *International Year of Sport and the Olympic Ideal*.

- Finland and Sweden vote to join the European Union.

- Jan. 1: The establishment of NAFTA

- Jan. 14: U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin sign the Kremlin Accords

- Feb. 12: Edvard Munch's famous painting "The Scream" is stolen from a museum in Oslo

- Feb. 12: Opening of the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer

- March 1-ish: China connects to the Internet for the first time

- March 1: Justin Bieber born

- March 12: First female priests in Church of England ordained

- March 27: Silvio Berlusconi elected Prime Minister of Italy

- March 31: Confirmed report of the discovery of the first complete *Australopithecus afarensis* skull

- April 7: The Rwandan Genocide begins

- April 8: Kurt Cobain of the popular band *Nirvana* found dead

- April 22: Death of controversial former U.S. President Richard Nixon

- April 27: The first multi-racial elections in South African history mark the formal end of Apartheid; Nelson Mandela elected president

- May 1: Death of Ayrton Senna, internationally celebrated Formula One champion, in an accident during a Grand Prix in Italy

- May 6: The great Channel Tunnel (or "Chunnel", as some came to call it) opens between England and France after over seven years of construction

- June 1: The Republic of South Africa rejoins the British Commonwealth after having left it in 1961

- June 15: Israel and the Vatican establish full diplomatic relations for the first time

- June 23: First Centennial of the International Olympic Committee

- July 12: Allied occupation of Berlin formally concludes

- August 31: Departure of Russian army from Latvia and Estonia marks formal conclusion of all Soviet occupation in Eastern Europe

- September 19: Deployment of American troops in support of exiled Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide

- October 3-4: Members of the Solar Temple Cult commit mass suicide at compounds in Canada and Switzerland

- November 5: Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan announces he has Alzheimer's Disease

- December 14: Construction of massive Three Gorges Dam in China begins

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the events of 1994, however, and I'm sure we'll be hearing about a great deal more of them as the months unfold.  

So: you may now discuss 1994 -- please use these powers responsibly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **[Last Week](http://www.reddit.com/r/wwi/comments/1sv8xu/weekly_freeforall_dec_14th_21st_2013/)**

**THIS WEEK:**

Merry Christmas to one and all!  The war has offered a sterling example of the "Christmas Spirit" in action with the notorious Truces of 1914, and I hope that we can look back upon them and feel inspired, in some measure, about what moments of fellowship are possible even for those who are under great duress.  I say this in a popular spirit, as I am one of those humbugs who does not look upon the Christmas Truce with any real delight, but I am emphatically sincere in hoping that you and yours have a happy, peaceful holiday.

So: this is a thread for discussion of whatever you like -- WWI-related or not! We encourage you to post about anything interesting that's been happening to or around you lately, any classes you may be taking or teaching come the winter term, things you saw on the news, etc. It's wide open.

All the same, the usual rules for posting are in effect -- keep it polite, charitable, and honest. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a fairly leisurely subreddit when it comes to content submission, and that's alright by me for now.  Everyone seems to be having a good time, and we seem to have a couple of good discussions each week on a variety of subjects -- though it's sometimes hard to predict what they'll be.

Still, I like to follow up on this from time to time: what is that you, as a reader, hope to get out of subscribing to /r/WWI?  Do you like photographs/drawings/maps from the war?  Do you like news about current commemorative projects?  Do you like reviews of books or movies?  Do you like links to documentaries or other videos?  Would you like more general discussion threads?

I post a lot of news, here, because it's part of my real-life job to keep on top of new developments in the field, but what else do you want to see? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A recent comment here in ToR mentioned the hypothetical possibility of a "moderator strike" -- what impact might such an event have on Reddit? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-14 04:27:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The comment is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1stjcm/rwtf_removes_itself_from_the_default_subreddits/ce15xcn), for reference.

The dimensions of the strike itself would be the determining factor; the moderators of the major/default subs all laying down their tools at the same time could have a considerable impact on those communities and upon the site at large, but it would also be entirely possible for the mod teams in other subreddits to not do anything at all for days without it even being apparent.  Many subreddits already have moderators like this as a matter of course.

So, some questions:

1. What (if anything) could cause a "strike" of this sort?

2. Which subs would have to participate in it for it to have any sort of noticeable impact?  I don't believe that "only the defaults" is necessarily the answer, here, but I'm open to being persuaded.

3. What sort of consequences might it have for a) those communities, b) Reddit generally and c) the moderators "on strike" in the first place?  I can say with certainty that consequences for us over in /r/AskHistorians would be... interesting, at the very least.

I don't remember ever having made a thread in ToR before even though I was a moderator here for a while.  I believe this one falls within the rules, but please let me know if it doesn't and I'll do what I can to revise it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Theory Thursday | Academic/Professional History Free-for-All </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-05 16:57:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **[Last week!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1rniea/theory_thursday_academicprofessional_history/)**

**This week:**

Today's thread is for open discussion of:

- History in the academy
- Historiographical disputes, debates and rivalries
- Implications of historical theory both abstractly and in application
- Philosophy of history 
- And so on

Regular participants in the Thursday threads should just keep doing what they've been doing; newcomers should take notice that this thread is meant for open discussion only of matters like those above, not just anything you like -- we'll have a thread on Friday for that, as usual.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm doing this as a self-post because the publication hosting the story -- *The Express* -- has been banned Reddit-wide for some sort of vote-gaming thing.

Anyway, [the story is here](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/444786/Richard-Attenborough-s-dream-of-film-about-first-black-flying-ace-is-saved).

I am very pleased that this is apparently going to happen, because good grief is this an amazing story:

 The grandson of a slave, Bullard was born in the US state of Georgia in 1895, one of 10 children. Desperate to escape the poverty and racial discrimination of the Deep South, aged 17 he stowed away on a merchant ship bound for Europe, dreaming of a new life in France.

 Put ashore in Britain, he earned a living as a boxer in London before moving to Paris and joining the Foreign Legion at the outbreak of the First World War.

 Wounded at Verdun, he then volunteered for flight training and served with the French Air Service, becoming the worlds first black fighter pilot and earning the nickname the Black Swallow of Death from the Press.

Come **on**. </TEXT>
