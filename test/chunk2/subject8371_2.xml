	<TITLE> The Jailor Game That Made Me Proud </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-07 01:29:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, this was a custom game. The Rolelist was:

Jailor

Mayor

2 TI's

TK 

TS

2 TP'S

GF

4 RM

NK

NE

A guy was pushing for a politics theme and I decided that my name would be Obama. No sooner had I pressed Submit than Donald J Trump asked someone to be Obama.

The first night, I jailed him. He claimed spy. I noted it in my will and survived. The mafia had killed a bodyguard and someone was blackmailed, so while I was kinda suspicious, I decided to let Trump go. No real leads were being tossed around.

That night, I jailed someone who didn't claim. I noted it down in my deathnote [(template here)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q_jMOOwA1x4zmM7xEDpsWV7A-g1SREGqDSVKtcGJaRk/edit?usp=sharing) and executed. I was killed that night by a vig shot. During the day, it was revealed that the person I executed was a disguiser, the mafia killed the Mayor, and a Werewolf killed the GF. People were saying things like 

"Finally. A Jailor with a brain."

"Yea. Too bad the vig had none."

(I laughed at that comment)

An investigator spoke up, saying that 6 (I forgot the name) was Med/Ret/Jan, and all 6 said was "Correct".

That night, I asked for a medium. No response was given, and I assumed that there was none, correctly. At this point I would like to point out that I was not in a party, and was playing completely against "Rando's". Anywho, I was then revived, and put the comical "N3: Dead" line in. It turned out that 6 was the ret, and was killed that night by the mafia. The moment I'm able to talk again, I say "TP on Me" and am almost instantly whispered by the doctor, Starboy. (I'm sorry if that wasn't your name, but I know it is close.)

That night, I randomly jail someone, and they claimed doc. I said that I already had a reliable doc claim, and executed. (I put this under the custom reason in my death note.) I was clearly hit by the mafia and healed, and I'd executed the witch that caused the vig to hit me.

That morning, we almost hung bigmama and I decided to use my final execute on them. Bigmama turned out to be the Blackmailer and the Mafioso hit the  That morning, me and the rest of the townies hung the final mafia member. I then realise that the WW is still out, and it's a full moon. I ask starboy to heal me, and jail Trump. In hindsight, jailing the WW would have ensured no deaths. It didn't matter, though. So, trump is going ballistic in jail, until I remind him about the WW and how I have 0 executes. I get hit by the  WW and healed by starboy, who sacraficed himself in the process.

We hang the WW (Sarah...something...) and town wins. Everybody is saying GG, including the mafia, and I got 11 friend requests. All-in-all, it was brilliant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had another epic play as exe. 

I roll it and my target is "John Willard"

N1: I write in my will that I investigated doodle, both as sheriff or inv. I throw in a vig will just in case. I turn out to be roleblocked, and mafia kills the ret and sk kills a vamp. It was just like the last game i played, only, last game I was the vamp.

N2: I "investigate" Willard, going for the inv will.

D3: No others died today. I delete the two others, and ask willard what role he claims. He claims escort, and I put 2 and 2 together and he is the one that RB'd me. I write down in my will "Willard - Vig/Vet/Mafioso" and reveal to town. Nobody suspects me of being exe, as I should have claimed yesterday. I push the lynch, and a lot of the town votes with me. Including a mayor that revealed to hang willard. He was screaming "DON'T LISTEN TO THE IDIOT INV!!" and whatnot, causing people to guilty him for no defence. He was lynched 15-0. I was laughing my ass off.

D8: In the end, I helped the arso get his win. It was Arso vs GF, and together when they revealed, I hung the GF. Brilliant game, 10/10 </TEXT>
