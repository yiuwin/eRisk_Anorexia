	<TEXT> This is really interesting. Also cool that it is launching in Utah. Could be a good idea if you are local and go with a group of people. 

I think this is a fantastic idea for visitors. They could save a lot of money by using Uber instead of renting a car. 

Think of it, they can take TRAX from the airport to downtown, and then Uber from their hotel to the slopes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. I don't think it will ever supersede Ukrainian or Russian. This is an important move for Ukraine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In one way, this is great because it is the international business language and will help Ukraine take a step forward and hopefully increase economic development. 

On the other hand, it is sad seeing little bits of culture diminish as english becomes the predominant language.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Growing up, I always had the itch to travel, I just didn't have the money for it and neither did my family. Because we didn't travel much, I got more and more restless as I waited to have my own job and money so I could fulfill my dreams. 

As I got older, I started saving money and I made it a goal to visit 2 new places each year. That doesn't seem like much, but it was a big start for me. As I was saving up for traveling and also school, I realized that there were going to have to be some big sacrifices I was going to have to make so I could finance my life. 

I decided that for me, traveling was more important than eating out at a restaurant, buying new clothes, or spending money on the movie theater. I missed out on a lot of experiences with my friends, and I spent a lot of dinners at restaurants sitting without any food in front of me so I could hang out with my friends and still save money. 

But I decided at the time that I wanted to make traveling a lifestyle and not just a special occasion. I absolutely loved walking around and exploring new cities, getting to know the culture of new places, and meeting new people. There isn't anything else quite like it in the whole world! 

My end goal is to be able to make traveling my career, and it is something I am working on now. But I just want to ask, what are the things you have had to sacrifice in your own personal life to make traveling a greater part of your life?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Didn't get to catch the game, but it's kinda nice to know that we were still able to win by double digits and we only scored 12 points in the fourth! 

Also, gotta love our defense! We may never score 100 points this season, but we won't have to if we can keep people under 80!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Going to go see Spectre (which I am so excited about!) and watch the Jazz vs. Memphis game. 

Just curious, how does everybody find out about events going on in the city? I've been using [spingo](https://www.spingo.com/events/ut/slc) because I like their app. I also use [city weekly](http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/EventSearch#/) because they have a pretty good calendar too. </TEXT>
