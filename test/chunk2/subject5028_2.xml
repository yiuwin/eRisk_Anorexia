	<TEXT> I agree, I think a lot of the backlash is from the people who recently were able to take valuable time off of work on June 21st to play this game. Since it is so close to Jun 21 I dont think anybody expected it to be delayed this late so a lot of people are upset now that they have essentially "wasted" a chill day off solely meant for playing this game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's more of what I am looking for, like some kind of dev chart saying (Next beta update will be "specified date" and will have "new features and fixes", and then next phase of beta after that) this has nothing. Not one bit of documentation and this game was funded by us. All the people who kickstarted it, and we know nothing about when the next update is supposed to come out even though we are in beta and the game is very much unplayable for many people. It's very weird.

EDIT: I should point out that I really want this game to be good. Im not trying to shit on the developers but I am getting quite concerned with the updates and features. The game is so bland right now. Besides the base NPC interactions(which are bugged to hell, at best) there is nothing special to this game. No random interactions, no people partying and drinking at bars. I dont know, i feel like the game is so bland at the moment, I want it to be updated soon so they can start proving me wrong. </TEXT>

This youtube comment kinda sum up how I am starting to feel about this game. I understand it's beta but so much is lacking from a game that has been under professional development for over 2 years. A beta is supposed to be a complete game with tons of bugs and optimizations left to fix. The combat is still very clunky(because its not been updated in 2 months), the dialogue and flow is very very poor, the game has 0 personality. There is nothing special about it at the moment besides that it is very pretty looking. Also before any of you shit on me for giving my opinion, know that I own this game and have put 14 frustrating hours into playing it. Although currently it is so bug riddled that I cannot stay in a game for longer than 15 minutes before my game crashes and corrupts my save. It is actually unplayable at this moment(for me at least). My main beef with this game right now is that it has not been updated since the beta was released and it desperately needs one to at least make it playable again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Barnetta's free kick from 25 yards out in the 90th minute Friday gave the Union a 2-1 MLS win over Orlando City before 15,011 at Talen Energy Stadium.

The shot hit inside the upper right cross bar and bounced in. The Union had set up their wall behind Orlando City's in an offside position, but then the players ran onside.

Orlando City keeper Joe Bendik, who made several big saves, barely moved on the shot.

"He was not comfortable, he couldn't see the ball and I was happy to take it and happy to score like this," said Barnetta

Barnetta's free kick from 25 yards out in the 90th minute Friday gave the Union a 2-1 MLS win over Orlando City before 15,011 at Talen Energy Stadium.

The shot hit inside the upper right cross bar and bounced in. The Union had set up their wall behind Orlando City's in an offside position, but then the players ran onside.

	<TEXT> So basically what you're saying is that you want a solid and very much needed goalkeeper to risk getting seriously injured trying to reach a ball that he knows is unstoppable so he can look like he tried? He isn't dumb, he knows what he is doing. He isn't going to go for a ball that far out of reach, there is 0 need to do that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of the bendik haters here are unpleasable. It's like they didn't see the other 90% of the game where he made 2 good saves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What'd you want him to do? the ball was significantly out of reach. That was an insanely well placed strike, some of you guys need to get out of the habit of blaming goalkeepers for every goal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How was that goal on bendik? He came out to block the ball that was going to be shot from near the post which is a very dangerous place to have someone take a shot from. But then a defender came out first and attempted to slide takcle the ball away and did but it also bounced back to the center of the box and then MacInerney was able to break free from his marked man and finished it. Where in there did bendik mess up? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, he is a hell of a keeper but he would be very expensive and he is pretty old. We can just keep bendik, who is 26 years old and doing just fine and let him grow with the team(hopefully) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed, I appreciate what they were going for here, but I am afraid it might not be achievable. I think it needs to be mainly grid based but still have the ability to make curved paths. Im not sure how they would do that but thats what they get payed to do. Besides the path system being wonky, i seriously think the core mechanics of this game are incredible. </TEXT>
