	<TEXT> I never thought twice about switching to QWER and have never thought of going back. The near-random positioning of legacy keys are just too awkward. Tbh, objective speaking, QWER are superior to legacy keys, I would presume that those of you who prefer legacy only prefer it because you are used to it and/or for nostalgia's sake. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tbh if they want him to be "truly" bilingual, speak Mandarin with them at home. Happened for me- I speak English almost all the time in school but it's the other way round (Mandarin) at home because my grandmother doesn't speak English. However, my written Chinese is (still) pretty damn bad. But if you ask me, that's getting less and less of a problem since everything is getting digitised; hanyu pinyin is used for typing Chinese. I also personally think that knowing how to speak is more useful than knowing how to write a secondary language.

It would also help to let him watch Mandarin TV shows or movies especially with English subtitles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Frankly speaking, aesthetics played a relatively big part of why I bought my ath-m50x bl and shure se215 SPE. Ultimately, I don't regret either purchases and don't intend to upgrade my headphones anymore though I know they're definitely better ones out there.

Aesthetics and ergonomic consideration show that the maker cares for their product and the people who are gonna use it. It gives the product a more personal, human feel as opposed to say a product with expensive parts thrown in and simply sold for profit. At least that's what I've learned to appreciate after having studied design. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> MP3 sounds noticeably better than Ogg Vorbis to me? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-12 19:41:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I use Spotify (Premium) 99% of the time for music on extreme quality, which is supposed to be 320kbps .Ogg format. But I also have some songs outside of Spotify in MP3 format (some are 320kbps, some are less) because they aren't available on Spotify. After numerous times of comparing my experience listening to Spotify with my own MP3 files, I can safely say that there is a difference that I clearly notice.

Spotify sounds muffled compared to my MP3 files; for example, the sound of cymbals are not as sharp and the sound of bass kicks are not as thumping on Spotify than my MP3 files. Overall said MP3 files, to me, sound brighter, more alive, have more clarity.

So the question is that shouldn't this be untrue? I've done some searches online and every source has stated that Ogg Vorbis is superior to MP3 in both audio fidelity and file size at the same bitrate. I've noticed this difference on both desktop and mobile, using ath-m50x headphones and shure se215 in-ears. Is it possibly a problem with Spotify? Or is it some subconscious audio preference of some sort? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Enemy pushing base, knowing that we are unlikely to win a head-on fight, we let our really farmed prophet rat. Enemy went for throne, which would have definitely lost against our prophet, **IF HE ALSO WENT FOR THE THRONE AS WELL THAT IS**. Instead, he totally neglected everything happening our base and went around trying to get mega creeps. And thus, fate has made me 50 MMR less than I should have been.

Also, not to mention our centaur who decided to defend a tier 1 after we killed 2 cores and could have taken a rax with him as frontline. And the other time when he was perfectly able to blink to safety but decided to assert dominance against 5 enemy heroes and paid for it with his life, and perhaps our win.

	<TEXT> There's so many good things about it I'll have to break it down into different parts.

Item stats:

* Gives damage, attack speed, critical.
* Gives INT and mana regen.
* The only downside of it is not providing any bulk.

Item active:

* Silence
* Truestrike on target
* 100% crit chance on target
* Further magical damage at the end of the duration based on total damage taken
* Most importantly, it's relatively spammable

Others:

* Very good buildup; orchid and crystalys are both viable for right clickers.
* Melts heroes that are supposedly tanky like BB.
* A much more useful choice than MKB to counter evasion.
* Does not require secret shop.

It's basically an extremely good pickup up on most cores, as opposed to orchid which used to be only gotten be clinkz and int right clickers. With this item, a lot of carries can go around hunting like clinkz which is pretty terrifying. So far, I've even gotten it on PA, DK and slardar and it has proved to be the game-winning item; have I not gotten Bloodthorn, I might have lost those games instead.

I think either the 100% crit or truestrike should be removed, maybe make the cooldown a little longer as well.

	<TITLE> I don't have much to say about the meta/balance but, hey, I think they nailed 6.87 in terms of fun. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-08 21:38:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just from looking at the patch notes, it seemed to be making matches real long and tedious; early pushing (and ganking to a small extent) are made less effective while farming up for lategame looks like the way to go. True enough, a lot of my games are around 50min with a relatively large amount going above an hour. 

But here's the thing: despite such long matches (in fact I once played 4 hour-long matches in a row), I did not find them tedious at all. I actually felt fun I've never had for many, many months. Let's see why:

From around 6.84-6.86, this is how matches roughly go:

* If you have roaming ganker(s) in your team, you'd likely win the laning phase and snowball towards victory itself.
* Junglers are the worst nightmare for every team. Games are more or less decided before most junglers could do something. But people pick them because they don't want to support anyway.
* Maybe it's just me, but I'd say around 80% of the games I played had been one-sided from start to end. Probably 15% of them are comeback/throw games, with only 5% being close fights. It's really off-putting to lose one-sided games *while winning them gets meaningless over time because it's just mindless pubstomping*

My experience with 6.87 so far:

* Haven't felt completely stomped over in a game so far. There was once or twice where I lost in only 30min but we lost against a team; it wasn't the situation of an over-fed mid or carry rolling over everyone, which used to happen frequently.
* Comebacks are real, and not just one-dimensional comebacks. So many times were there multiple advantage turnovers in a single match. That's the kind of intense team dota I want to play!
* Haven't felt demoralized from a loss so far honestly. I actually get pumped to continue playing no matter the result (provided I'm not worn out).
* Despite the focus on the lategame, supports don't seem to get shat over by fully farmed cores. Probably a result of the INT spell damage change? When playing some un-tanky support, I somehow no longer have the "be super safe, stay behind, you'll die in a second if you get caught" mentality.

What do you guys think? Have you been having fun in this patch?

	<TEXT> As you all know, AM sees magic of all forms as his enemy. But guess what he's doing every 5 seconds or so? Blinking here and there, and using what? **Magic**. Dude, not cool. AM is supposed to be an acolyte, seems more like a hypocrite. A *hypocryte*. So here is my suggestion to remove the hypocrisy in him and have him regain his honor as a badass monk.

**MANA BREAK**: When AM burns mana from his target, he gains *Purity of Will* charges based on the amount of mana burned. When AM dies, he loses half the amount of charges he contains.

**BLINK**: Blink now uses 60 *Purity of Will* charges instead of mana.

**SPELL SHIELD**: For every point of magical damage taken (after reduction), AM loses the same amount of *Purity of Will* charges. If he has no charges, Spell Shield is disabled.

**MANA VOID**: Now costs 125/200/275 *purity of Will* charges instead of mana. AM also gains the same amount of *Purity of Will* charges as the total damage he deals with Mana Void. Is also now pure damage instead of magical.

**Item Abilities**: When AM use item abilities, he retains the use of mana to cast them them but also loses the same amount of HP as the manacost for dishonoring himself.

IceFrog I hope this gives you an idea for 6.87 so you can quickly release it. Kappa </TEXT>
