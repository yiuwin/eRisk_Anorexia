	<TEXT> Their are a lot of Christians that, like myself, believe in evolution. I also don't think gays and transgendered people will burn in hell. And on a personal note I don't see any of them as a threat to any religion or society for that matter. I will say though that allowing anyone to go into any bathroom or changing room and school shower is just a bad idea. There are real issues with allowing that other than moral ones. It's true that rape and public sex goes on in these places now even before this debate, but giving people that will do these things easier access to do so is just a bad idea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True the Bible has old testament records of that kind of action but when Jesus was born he preached understanding, peace, and acceptance of others. He had to walk in mans flesh and be tempted by man's flesh to better help his father understand man's struggle with sin. When Jesus died  on the cross he made the old testament void and null. Now look at the Koran and its prophet Mohammad. Mohamad was himself a fucked up person. He said and did things that even back then many believed to be wrong. The Bible may have started off rough and cruel but Jesus set it right and was all about the peace. Can't say that about Mohammad. So there ya go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care for that caustic religion. If your religion calls for the death and inslavement of those who don't worship your god then I also feel you shouldn't be able to be in a country that has such a diverse range of religious beliefs. Nor should you willfully go to a country that can and will upset your religious beliefs.  </TEXT>
