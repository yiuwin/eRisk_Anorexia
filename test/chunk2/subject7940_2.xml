	<TEXT> I tend to work to impress myself in a kind of mixture between the edges of your dilemma.

I always loved the story of the artistic movements and pieces of work and it made me to develop the ability to understand the logic of production and to try some movements in the fields of multimedia art.

As I never liked to expose my works online because of the services available, then, again, in order to impress myself, I developed a website to do so: [Quaestio.org](https://quaestio.org/).

When I did this, I understood it could help a lot of people in the same situation, so I reformulated its structure during the development just to make it open to everybody somehow.

Now, I am dealing in another level, trying to make other people so impressed as me with my works in order that it starts to work by itself.

Different from you, if I relied on other people support, I would never be able to keep it up because I always played discretely, but now I understand the difficult of spreading a novelty and the "shamanic" sense it has, so I am playing a much more interesting game now, learning how to do the work both to impress me and the people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly.

What I tried to explore in this work was a slightly detailed effect that differs between the shapes.

For instance, if the shapes flow to the center, the effect is expansive and vice versa; and if you change the edges of the shape, it happens that the points serve to distort the effect, what creates different experiences, in the case, generic ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, I guess the post format chosen was not the best at all, my friend.

The text is a description about the linked work, Vertentes, a collection of 9 videos in which each one depicts a geometrical shape related with a number as the theme for the movement.

[Cel animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_animation) is a traditional way to animate videos made of static images; [phi phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_phenomenon) is a concept that explains how the mind gets the trick; and [motion aftereffect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_aftereffect) is the effect caused by the illusion.

If you still have any doubt about it, I do not mind to explain it more or again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is interesting how artistic works about woods and trees can be conceptually experimented on wood.

Works like this shows us how we can logically understand such model: *wood* is not equal to *wood* at the same time *wood* is equal to *wood*.

It is a proper piece for thingking about ideas and ideas of ideas. </TEXT>

A series of nine optical illusions each one with ninety seconds of monochromatic cel animation experimenting the concepts of motion aftereffect and phi phenomenon focused in the flow of different mathematical vertices and geometrical angles in order to try to achieve a minimalist experience of the infinite and eternal becoming by the effectiveness of a gestalt-like op art causer of a vertiginous and stimulant visual phenomena.

I even shared the [plugin](https://www.reddit.com/r/WordpressPlugins/comments/4jb3rl/free_catag_categoriestagsattributes_lists_and/) here this week.

In the case, users will not search for the tags/categories by an engine; instead, they will look for words that they like in a cloud with at least 999 items (but you can configure as 0 to show all).

I hope [it](https://wordpress.org/plugins/catag/) might help you somehow in the making of an intuitive way to deal with searches. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **CATAG** is a simple plugin that adds a list of categories or tags or attributes to text areas of a post or a portfolio; it even adds a taxonomy cloud mixing tags and categories for being placed in a page.

*Shortcodes:*

* [cats] = it lists the categories of a single post;
* [tags] = it lists the tags of a singles post;
* [atts] = it lists the attributes of a single portfolio;
* [catag] = it adds a taxonomy cloud of categories and tags of the blog.

**CATAG** does not add styles to its features by the moment, so you are invited to do so by custom CSS. </TEXT>

 Something weird, probably a glitch, happened when Franklin was returning home after some time and as well as he was getting to the hood, Chop ran away and began to circulate the indoor dome; the strange thing is that in the last hangout with Lamar, they talked about how Chop is able or not to work with them.

 When you restart, pay attention to one dialogue where Franklin and Lamar talk about Chop and observe if he runs again in the direction of the dome after this conversation.
It was very weird because Franklin did not even get home and Chop appeared running in the street; following him, I circulate the dome, Maze Bank Arena, but, in a car, two stars popped up and he was lost after some time. </TEXT>

The most interesting thing I noticed until now is that Trevor says his name is "Trevor with three Vs" when you drive the stock market guy to the airport with him, while you will probably pass by the building which, if I am not wrong, has Vs in three sides of it. </TEXT>

It happens this set is my favorite for its RGB/CAM values, so it is being a perfect theme for a starting collection about mathematics and geometry: [Mathemetria](https://quaestio.org/objects/mathemetria/).

And it is a way to see the crescent growth resultant of the power of two in its duplications and a way to divide a square by three parts.

If you see it diagonally, it kind of turns into the shape of a heart in a soulmate manner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is right: good addition!

I have been playing with the cellphone always blacked, but until now nothing different happenened.

What is the function of this number is still a doubt and we do not even know if it has a one, more than its known features.

Lately, I have found [this](http://imgur.com/s39gP46) among the textures, what seems to have a little piece of knowledge about the number somehow.

I started another [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/42zmxc/black_cellphones_clues_in_the_storyline/) about possible clues on the subject in the storyline. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are probably right about lower online density causing less random explosions and maybe more activity around the map guarantees more normality too.

These explosions seem to be heard usually inside interiors and the damage occurs outside, but I do not dischage unresponsive NPCs either.

And I do not know much about online missions and never played this one, I only use to fly in the free roam mode. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What people claim about random explosions is that they are related with some kind of real explosions that happen in the game.

I have already seen people that, after the explosion, witnessed crashed planes at the golf course while hearing it from Michael's house, for example.

I have already experienced one during the second mission of Barry when I was almost delivering the car with the tow truck, but I could not see anything exploded.

And I have been playing online a lot lately and it seems it does not happen there so oftenly, besides some explosions heard from inside the house.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for your kind words, my friend!

What I can say is that, in the last years, I realized how we should avoid negativity as well as we are able to do it: it is like a contagious disease trying to have us by its side with no benefits for us in the end, besides an apparent sensation of power.

The only circumstance it may be allowed is in reaction against negativity in itself, but with written words we have a lot of ways to avoid it anyway, what is not always possible in a quick discussion or while urgent actions are required, unfortunately; and I like grammar and languages, then, it is also a personal challenge for me and a matter of respect for you all.

Other thing, there is no real fun in being boring or sarcastic if someone else will have to suffer for it, even when people like to be in this role, because it is just a way to invite us to play the game they are stuck in (and it is not GTA V).

Philosophically and ethically, at least, I guess it never goes well to be an evil bearer because that only leaves the one vulnerable against the true power of what is good.

But, your doubt was truly valid after all, I had the same doubt as you and I had to search about it to clarify it to myself, so I thought I could answer your question properly. </TEXT>

I have read it too and I do not doubt since peyote's monologues are mostly nonsensical, but we would have to test it to be sure: a quick save with Michael close to a dog's peyote might answer it easily.

Besides trying to find Michael with Chop, we could try to use Michael as dog to find Chop nearby his kennel too in the field of tests. </TEXT>
