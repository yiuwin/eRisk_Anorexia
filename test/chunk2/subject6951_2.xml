	<TEXT> How can citizens of a country benefit from a black market currency that has a more depreciated rate against the usd than the offical rate? How can they get greater profit margin when importing goods in the country with this lower rate? Or are you saying that the black market would make greater profit margin because with a more depreciated currency, increased exports would boost productivity levels in the economy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's take the case of Sudan. The "official" rate for the currency is of 6.01 sudanese pound and the black market rate is of 10.10 sudanese pound. 

My initial question was, why would the black market producers want to depreciate their currency against the usd?, and my understanding was that perhaps that would benefit to the sudanese exporters as it will make their products appear cheaper than the rest of the world.

My second question was. That fixed official exchange rate doesn't seem to be regulated by anyone since there is still a black market price. If the central banks would've reduced the supply of the currency, the black market rate would've increased to similar levels as the official rate. But It didn't! and that's what made me wonder about how they are still able to keep that rate stable. Is it just a law that tells banks, etc.. to supply that currency at  6.01 sudanese pound for every dollar? Also it made me wonder if corruption was also a factor involved in the persisting presence of the black market, the government doesn't used their money to remove the black market rate. 

We could also think of the government and the producers to have different view. Perhaps the government wants to have an appreciated official rate towards the Usd to so that the country can import more and hence improving the living conditions in sudan (which is only a short term solution)
Whereas the producers would prefer having greater exports, by having a depreciated currency, which will reduce the trade deficit and improve the economic productivity in the country (i think that would be long run objective).
Perhaps producers want to cope with the 75% oil export loss after 2011 (creation of south sudan which had most of the oil).


Anyways, this is somewhat confusing to me. Where does corruption stand here? and what should the government do to improve their citizens' life (if we disregard corruption) ?? Does what I said even makes sense? 

Here's the article I read about this topic: http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article56611

Any thoughts?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Electric current provided by hydroelectric power plants needs to be precisely 50Hz/60Hz when it arrives at your household plugs. My physics teacher said that this current wasn't converted nor modified during its trip to the household. So my question is what makes that electric current stable at 60Hz/50Hz when it leaves the station? I've looked into it, asked some engineers about it but only got some vague answers. Any scientist willing to answer me? </TEXT>
