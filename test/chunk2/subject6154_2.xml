	<TEXT> Like I said, please WATCH the video. Don't skim it, and misinterpret it.

It may take a month to be resolved, but in the meantime - your video is PUBLIC and EARNING revenue. **So, in other words: there is no problem whatsoever.**

*Hence why I answered.*  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While this is a valid reason, in my experience (which is greater than YMS's) - it's extremely unlikely for a film studio to issue a takedown notice of a movie review... ESPECIALLY within the first few days. 

Besides, just initiating the dispute process will automatically reinstate any "taken-down" videos. Seems to me like YMS is just being overly cautious when he doesn't need to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Watch this video on Content ID - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slgldWAsB0M *(many of the other commenters  here probably should too)*

2) **Upload your content as usual.** If you get a claim, file a dispute. If you lose the dispute, appeal. If you lose the appeal, issue a counter-notification. It might be a bit scary, but it's not a difficult process, and takes maybe  30 seconds to actually go through.

*Source: I've uploaded 750+ videos with 3rd-party copyrighted material, been hit with over 2,000 separate Content ID claims and still have a 100% win-rate.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Anyone got experience with this?

Yes, of course. Which is why I wrote up an exhaustive video on the subject that's been linked from this SubReddit's sidebar since 2013 :-) Please watch it, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slgldWAsB0M

But to your specific issue, a flag =/= claim. They're two very separate actions on YouTube. And, why bother trying to avoid Content ID? If it's fair use as you claim, you'll have MUCH better luck just defending your content by disputing it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not worried at all. This is a lot of noise about very little in my opinion. So far... how many videos have been affected? About five out of five billion. This isn't going to affect my approach to content at all. But as I've been selling to outside platforms and partnering more with sponsors, I've already been making a conscious effect to transition from R to PG-13. 

I will say though, the optics for YouTube on this are horrible. Watch this entire thing blow over and be forgotten about within two months. Thanks for the polite reply :-)

	<TITLE> PSA: "Cash Offer" from NetworkOfOne? Don't devalue your earnings potential! /x-post to /r/letsplay </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-10 01:36:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I received two separate offers from this group in the past week, so I'm guessing many others have too. In my 10 years on YouTube, and relatively popularity, I've received hundreds of offers like this over the years, so I wanted to share some advice to younger and less-experienced YouTubers:

NetworkOfOne has been sending out the following, 

 *My company is Network Of One, a Certified YouTube Partner in Los Angeles, CA that invests in YouTube videos.*
 
 *Since 2014 weve partnered with tens of thousands of creators around the world just like you, paying cash the same day for their videos.*
 
 *Weve just come across your channel   video and are able to pay you today for your video. Our offer would not affect any other videos on your channel currently or in the future.*
 *Respond now and one of our Content Specialists will provide details on our offer and answer any of your questions.*
 
 *Below is a link to testimonials from YouTube creators just like you who we have worked with in the past. And also there are links to our company websites where you can learn more about Network of One.*

This initial pitch is **extremely** vague, and likely-so on purpose (or, perhaps they're just stupid). Here's how their offer actually works: the "video" they want to "pay cash for" is actually 20 or more videos, and usually some of your most popular uploads. In exchange for a one time payment, you agree to forfeit your monetization-claim on these videos to their CMS. Meaning, for the *lifetime of the video* - you can never earn money on them again.

I can't speak for everyone's earnings-potential, but they offered me $1,000 for 20 of my biggest videos - the kind of content that brings in that sort of cash every 2-3 months. And they want me to forfeit this potential revenue - in perpetuity - for a one-time fee.

So, **TL;DR** - NetworkOfOne may be a "legitimate" company, but they prey on ignorance and GREATLY devalue your work. Do NOT accept their quick-buck if your content has any earnings potential on its own.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **My short bio:** I began YouTube ten years ago, and have been earning a living from it since 2008. Currently, my small network of channels have over 1 million combined subscribers, and around 500,000,000 total views. I originally gained "fame" for co-creating a little comedy/science show called, **["Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64EuxEqh2Ow index=10 list=PLU4IMu04MIlIRrb_QQIARt8Fbwv6urmyM)**. These days I [review movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFdpveawEdA), [talk news/politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZvGraHD__8), do [let's plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3uarnZaJ0c), host [editing tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOaPBpGbxbE index=8 list=PLU4IMu04MIlJuPrvhyGf0AxNIwpfGd4rd), share [travel vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR4MIo21zrA), and read funny [spam e-mails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH8A5zxnnps).

Thanks to my extensive library of movie reviews (~600), I've been hit with 2,000+ individual Content ID claims over the years. But I'm proud to report I've fought and won 100% of these. I also (technically) own/control my own multi-channel network, so I have experience dealing with claims/copyright from the "other side" of the equation. 

There has been a LOT of misinformation on Reddit in the past few weeks regarding this system and how it works, so [I'd love to dispel some of the incorrect assumptions you might have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slgldWAsB0M).

I hosted an AMA a couple years ago and had a lot of fun with it, so thought I'd try again! Also, I just celebrated my 4th cakeday, so AMA!

The worst plot-hole in this (otherwise incredibly absurd) movie is why Archer's wife, (Joan Allen) doesn't notice her husband's body is entirely different when they make love. 

**The swapped faces, not cocks.** Surely, she would have noticed? Haha, still a fun movie - but that bit annoyed me more than the rest of the nonsense here. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Discovering "Assassin's Creed" for the first time... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-26 21:11:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For whatever reason, I overlooked and ignored this series since it premiered in 2007. I recently purchased I and II for $10 (combined), and decided to try 'em out.

WOW! Well, actually... the first game is just okay. Very repetitive, clumsy controls, and a very boring story (no cinematic angles or subtitles? = hard to follow). But it showed promise, especially with its historical setting and exploration-based game mechanics. Luckily, its sequel fixed all the major issues I had.

"Assassin's Creed 2" is some of the most fun I've had gaming in a LONG time. Going on endless fetch-quests is actually pretty fun! I'm getting to explore beautiful Italian cities I've been to IRL, and the characters and story are vastly more intriquing. Plus, parkouring around rooftops and pushing off archers or doing stealth assassinations with the hidden blade never gets old.

But the best part about being a *Patient Gamer* though? I know this fun doesn't have to end! I already picked up "Brotherhood" for $8 off Amazon. No waiting between sequels, either!

So, to others whom may have overlooked this series... and are still clinging onto your old-gen systems like me: **give it a shot**, there's an entire franchise definitely worth exploring.

	<TEXT> Recently, I began experimenting with bulk-uploading parts of my LPs as unlisted playlists. And today, I was able to post my 24th series all at once. The first episode will go live tonight, but the rest remain unlisted. But from the first video, viewers can click a link and watch ahead, and marathon through the series without waiting. Otherwise, the remaining videos will get pushed out to my subscribers according to my upload schedule.

I'm not positive this strategy drives more viewership, but it's definitely easier on me (everything is done ahead of time, and just have to flip them from unlisted  public going forward)... and the more die-hard audience members seem to enjoy the convenience as well. But I wanted to hear /r/letsplay thoughts - and whether anyone else has tried this, and what their findings were.

Thanks :-)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **UPDATE**: less than 24-hours later, the claim was released. Which is exactly what I suspected, as MC for Warner Bros. is typically the quickest and most responsive of all CMS-agents I've dealt with. The e-mail is still a mystery, but I was obviously correct to call their bluff... video is back up and earning revenue again :)


++++++++++++ Original Post ++++++++


So, as many of you on /r/LetsPlay may already know - I'm extremely familiar with Content ID (my video is listed in the sidebar Wiki)... and I've disputed, and won over 2,000 separate copyright claims on YouTube. But this weird e-mail from  YT Claim Resolution  is a new one, even for me. 

Some background... I reviewed the Mad Max 4 trailer last month, and it was quickly hit with a copyright match (it happens). I quickly disputed it, and unfortunately lost. Then, I quickly appealed it... and am currently waiting on the decision. I've done this process many times, and have never had any direct contact with the claimant, so that's a bit suspicious right there. Here are few other reasons.

* MC For Warner Bros. would never communicate privately regarding an individual appeal, let alone from an unsigned, @gmail address.

* Section 6D actually continues to mention that acceptable use includes instances where "you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material." - And luckily for me, film criticism easily qualifies. 

* I've never once heard of a company, especially a big CMS account like MC for Warner Bros. giving the user a warning.

* The bit about not being able to appeal a video removal / strike is also totally wrong.

* Generally, any message telling you to do something you don't want to do (reset password, delete a video, sign into a different account) is a red-flag for some phising, or scam-type motive.

Now, the only thing that actually concerns me is the timeliness of the message - I only just appealed the video yesterday, and only Warner Bros. could have known that. So while everything else screams "fake / bullshit / scam"... **it is alarming that the e-mail has certain, non-public information**.


Included below, the *entire* message:

 Dear Jonathan Paula,

 We have received your dispute appeal on the following video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIEH4kbW90

 Please note, the video you uploaded contains content owned by Warner Bros., in breach of Section 6D of YouTubes Terms of Service, which provides, among other things, that you wont upload clips containing content owned by others without their permission.  Notwithstanding your breach of those Terms of Service, our action taken with respect to your uploaded video  which you disputed was intended to monetize or track the video, not to remove it from YouTube.

 Unfortunately, due to YouTubes policies, your appeal of our reinstated claim has placed Warner Bros. in a position where the only remaining course of action available is to request removal of your video through the procedures that YouTube provides. A total of three (3) such removals will terminate your YouTube account.  At this time, YouTube does not permit a repeal of your action.

 Although we did not wish for you to delete your upload in this case, you should know that you may chose to voluntarily delete the upload from your YouTube video manager within seven (7) days of receipt of this notice in order to avoid having a forced removal count against your YouTube account.

 In the future, you can avoid consequences of the appeal process by not disputing or appealing claims made by the rightful copyright holder, Warner Bros.

 Thank you.*

**Anyway, I'm sharing this here if only to serve as some education / warning for others who might receive a similar message, and to ask if anyone else has experience with this. Thanks for reading!**

This isn't strictly a LP-related issue, but let's be honest... of all the YouTube SubReddits, this is the smartest, and most active :-)

**TL;DR:** Got a suspicious e-mail about a Content ID appeal that seems like scam, but it knew about my ongoing dispute that isn't public knowledge.  </TEXT>

EDIT: Now I'm finding .MTS, .mp4, and non-transparent .avi files are giving me unsupported issues. Surely something is borked in preferences or something, right? There's no way support has been removed for these basic file types. Maybe I'll try a free install... * sigh* </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Optimizing Your Video Titles For Maximum Effectiveness. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-05 00:49:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've noticed many users in this forum are formating their video titles in a less than optimal way. So here's how you can improve them, and help increase your search rankings, and effectiveness at pulling in new viewers.

The YouTube Playbook [suggests](http://www.youtube.com/yt/playbook/metadata.html), 

* *Display branding and episode numbers toward the end when appropriate.* 

Now, [here's an example](http://i.imgur.com/VQc2cvj.png) of a **less ideal** arragment: (sorry, [teaisformugsMC](https://www.youtube.com/user/teaisformugsMC/)). By placing the non-unique information and branding first (in this case, the full title of the game, episode #, or your channel), you're truncating the unique, descriptive aspect of these particular episodes. And they end up all looking *exactly* the same, giving the viewer no compelling reason to select one out of a "related videos" line-up. This is amplified by having identical thumbnails across a series well.

There's also a fair deal of redundant information - **the thumbnails and video titles should *compliment* each other**. If the thumbnail very clearly illustrates what game it is - there's no reason to lead the video title with that same information. Save that precious space for a catchy title that'll pull the viewer in, and save "Minecraft LPs by GamingDudez69" for the end of the title. 

Thusly,

 "Minecraft Adventure Map! Reverie: The Uprising - Episode 3: The Blood Capsules" 


*becomes*, 

 "The Blood Capsules - Reverie: The Uprising, Minecraft Adventure Map!  #3", 

or something similar.

* *ProTip: don't be afraid to include branding hashtags in your title too: when anyone re-shares your video on Twitter, or elsewhere, these will help with discovery.* 

Using myself as our second example, (because I'm a narcissist), **[here is a more effective way of formating your video titles](http://imgur.com/crtE2Z7)**. Here, we lead with the unique, flashy title for each video... and even though "Grand Theft Auto V" is cut-off from view in a few instances, it will still be detected by YouTube's search-algorithms (meaning, it's still important to include)... but even with that information out of view, the viewer can clearly see the thumbnails, and know what game this is from.

Some simple, but proven strategies that will hopefully help you grab new viewers while growing your channel. I hope this helped some... good luck :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **TL;DR:** There's lots of bottom-feeding multi-channel networks out there, preying on people's ignorance, and sending them private YouTube messages with lots of fancy buzz-words, in hopes of propagating their pyramid scheme. They offer little, and swallow up as many channel as they can. I recommend avoiding them.

When one of these networks reaches out to me (on the smallest channel I run), via the now defunct YouTube PM system, I know they're a waste of time. But since some of you may have seen or dealt with some of these, I thought I'd share my playful response to a recent message I received from the MCN, "Freedom" -- which besides providing a laugh or two will also helpfully educate some folks here how little they, and others, actually do offer.

**The message:** From "Ricardo Aragon", *(a channel with zero subs itself).*
 Hello, 
You've got a very nice channel and we love what you are doing with it. Your channel is now eligible to join YouTube Partner Program, because you are focused on great videos we'd like to invite you to apply for a partnership with our fast growing YouTube network Freedom!
No lock-in forever contract!
Come or go anytime! Whenever you want!
Transparency
We enable revenue visibility in your YouTube channel and nothing is hidden!
Revenue share
You start at 60% of YouTube's 100% and can grow (i.e. it is not 60% of 80% or some other silliness).
No minimum payout
If you earn $1, we pay you $1!
Ownership
You own your channel and content, and we are your technology partner!
Content ID
We can find all copies of your original content anywhere on YouTube and monetize or takedown the matches (if you are a musician, this means we can monetize all copies of your music anywhere on YouTube!)
Audio only
We have two CMS's, one for music and one for non-music. The music CMS lets us match just the audio in a video and we can claim very specific rights for your music across YouTube!
Record labels
Many record labels signed with us, and we negotiated access to professional music for you!
No withholding tax
You earn 100% of everything you make. There are no tax forms to fill out from Freedom!, and no withholding tax. Simple.

 Earnings: 

 So what do you actually earn then per 1,000 views? We don't place a set $2 or $3 cap on your earnings the way other networks do. Many of our partners have earned over a $10 RPM from their videos.
Payments are issued at the end of each month on a 2 month delay. This means that all of your earnings from January will be sent to you via PayPal by the end of March, February earnings sent in April, etc. You will always be e-mailed a full report that shows you your earnings before the payment is sent out so you know exactly what to expect in your account by the end of each month.

**My reply:**
 You seem like a nice guy Ricardo, but you're also full of shit - and I feel compelled to let you know why that that is the case, so let's go over your message one point at a time, shall we?

 1) "Your channel is now eligible to join YouTube Partner Program".
-- I've been a member of the partner program since 2008, which is before your company even existed.

 2) "No lock-in forever contract!"
-- I already have that with Google directly.

 3) "We enable revenue visibility..."
-- Again, a feature I have had for years.

 4) "No minimum payout"
-- Well, thank goodness for that! But as a full-time YouTuber, it'd be awfully embarrassing if I couldn't clear $100 in a single month, don't you think?

 5) "You start at 60% of YouTube's 100%"
-- Now, this is just a disingenuous lie. YouTube takes 45% off the top, we all know that (at least, you should)... so offering me more than that is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE. And if you're only offering me 60% of what I *already* make? You're the worst negotiator in the world.

 6) "You own your channel and content"
-- Yeah, I already do.

 7) "Content ID"
-- As a network owner myself, I've had access to these tools personally since - you guessed it - before your company even existed.

 8) "Many record labels signed with us, and we negotiated access to professional music for you!"
-- I don't believe you.

 9) "No withholding tax"
-- Well, since you're not offering me permanent employment within your company, that would be illegal. 

 10) "You earn 100% of everything you make."
-- You literally just told me it was 60%. For fuck's sake... 

 11) "We don't place a set $2 or $3 cap on your earnings the way other networks do."
-- Yeah, no one actually does this anymore.

 12) "Payments are issued at the end of each month on a 2 month delay."
-- I already get paid on a 20-day delay, pushing that to 60 is a bit much, don't you agree?

 13) "Many of our partners have earned over a $10 RPM from their videos."
-- My long-form content receives more than this amount already.

 So tell me, Richardo... why would anyone, in their right mind be convinced by this pitch, and sign with Freedom?

So of the 13 "positives" Freedom listed, only a couple are *potentially* valuable, but only to smaller channels: having a low-payment threshold might be helpful, or their supposed collection of music labels (no actual brands/companies are listed anywhere on their site), and being protected by Content ID might be beneficial. 

What irks me the most about these incessant MCN-offers is their cold, informal attitude. These networks represent someone you are going to **do business** with... and yet they can't even be bothered to learn your name, anything about you, or in my case - that I already run my own network! It's insulting, and amateurish. I've been advising for years that many YouTubers are better off *staying independent*... but if you really must sign with someone: engage in a real conversation with someone in charge, and negotiate for the best possible deal. If this isn't something you believe you can do at your level of "success" yet, than honestly - you probably don't need the support or benefits of a network anyway.

Good luck to you, and thanks for reading... I had a fun time blowing off some annoyance/anger with my reply :-) </TEXT>
