	<TEXT> Input's welcome, thanks a lot! I didn't want to darken Jimi completely, because I think that'd obscure the delicacy of the softest lines (Stylewise I aimed for something very close to this: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Museo_del_Prado_-_Goya_-_Caprichos_-_No._01_-_Autorretrato._Francisco_Goya_y_Lucientes,_pintor.jpg)
That makes it difficult on the other hand to articulate soft features like cheeck bones. I need to find some middle way.

Shadows: The other guy is Johann Sebastian Bach. Only one known portrait (this one: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Johann_Sebastian_Bach.jpg) exists of him (another's attribution is dubious), so I don't have a lot of references to choose from and, for lack of skill, didn't change a bit of the posture, and neither of the lighting. Now this particular painting is lit so that the whole face is displayed brightly and one side  the right, from the viewer  has only a slight accent of shadow. To keep it consistent, Jimi didn't get more conspicuous shadowing either, also for the convenience that deep black is hard to achieve with this fine hatching and this particular ink (which turns really black only in large splotches). Next time I'd alter Bach more significantly to play by the rules of drawing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone! I've been experimenting with contrasting different nib techniques. The entire drawing has been executed using just the one same (flexible) nib. I'd be grateful for any feedback on how the result now actually looks like and could be improved. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm grateful for any feedback! This is not a plein-air drawing, but made from a photo I took over two years ago on a holiday in Denmark (with many changes, though). </TEXT>
