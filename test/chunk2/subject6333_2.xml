	<TEXT> In the first season I really liked Littlefinger, his character was very intriguing and I liked the way he was sort of building his power. But as the seasons went on he became less interesting, when he visited  The Eyrie is when he became pretty boring, instead of having to maneuvre through the political intrigue of King's Landing he basically became lord of The Vale and lost alot of his intrigue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Romance is quite hard to do without a guide, I recommend using the wiki.

The main quests are meant to be played at different levels, if combat is too hard in a specific quest you're probably under-levelled.

Companions are easy to miss, try to talk to everybody for about the first 1/3 of the game.

Alchemy, traps and poisons are sorta useless, so don't worry about them.

If you enjoyed the game definitely buy Awakening, it might be the best DLC in the series and also acts as a bit of a segue to DA2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The chronological order is the best way to watch but don't worry about getting bamboozled going back and forth between seasons, it's near enough to  release order.

The show is getting removed from netflix although you can still watch it for free on other sites (kiss cartoon is a good one). </TEXT>
