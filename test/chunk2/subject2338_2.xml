	<TEXT> The people. 
I've travelled to big cities,like NYC,L.A,Denver and Las Vegas,and I was kinda taken aback by how rude people can be. I've lived in Montana since I was 8,and the people are by the far the most hard-working,kind,helpful and friendly people that I've ever met. I have a really hard time imagining living anywhere other than Montana </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2012-13. My anorexia reared it's ugly head, after I thought I had recovered. I ended up in rehab(against my will,court ordered) and I lost quite a few friends,and family members through the process. I bounced back,got into college,and again,my anorexia came storming back. I dropped down to 85 pounds,and I'm 5'6". I had to drop out of college mid semester and move back home. 

Because my weight was so low,I was placed basically on bed rest. Bulimia came into the picture at this time and I gained 10 pounds very quickly. I rarely left my house and I had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror.

Now I'm getting my shit back together! I got a very good job at a fancy schmancy hotel,I broke up with a very controlling,demeaning boyfriend,I chopped off my hair(I swear,it made a difference on my mood)and I'm now working on my college applications for the fall semester. I'm bouncing back!
