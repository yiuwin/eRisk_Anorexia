	<TEXT> It's not that I want to be alone all the times, sometimes I really want to go out with my friends, to say, the cinema. But, when it comes to sharing things about ourselves and deepening our connection (talking about life, girlfriends, etc), I just want to distance myself for some reason.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think just knowing they want to connect to me, I think I might be because I really don't like expressing any form of intimacy and just makes me really uncomfortable (self disclosure, hugging, and so on). That's probably why I felt more comfortable connecting to my friends when they were relative strangers, to avoid all the intimacy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This might sound really stupid, but just don't think about it. Let the conversation flow naturally, and everything will just come to you. You could start off by asking a few questions on things that interest YOU (really important), but then let the conversation naturally go on, don't force it to! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is this an introvert thing, or something else? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, not sure what subreddit I should've asked this in but here it goes:

Ever since I was about 12 (I'm 18 now), I feel uncomfortable having close friends, it just feels really weird to me.

Recently, I've had a 2 week holiday from college, and have been in solitude for the full 2 weeks just studying and doing my own things. An hour ago, I opened up my phone and have messages from a couple of close friends, but I don't know why... but I just don't want to talk to them. 

It's not that they're bad friends, I think they're absolutely awesome, I just feel uncomfortable for some reason having close relationships with anybody, even to an extent with my own family members.

I think it happens more when I'm alone with someone close to me, I feel uncomfortable.

Is this introversion or something else entirely?

Thanks in advance for any advice. </TEXT>
