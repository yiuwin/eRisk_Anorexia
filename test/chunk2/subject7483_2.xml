	<TEXT> You could argue that pretty much every battle was important, but for me and my field I would say the Battle of Moscow. If the Wehrmacht had prevailed against the Red Army and taken the city it is very possible that the Red Army would have collapsed. It is also the very neck-to-neck aspect of the battle that makes it important to me. Of course the outcome of this battle was influenced by Khalin (Spelling?) Gol, which was influenced by earlier battles, so on so forth.  </TEXT>
