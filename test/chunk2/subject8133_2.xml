	<TEXT> Sorry, I meant my base nicotine is 80% PG, 20% VG
My target juice is normally 70% PG, 30% VG.
Too much PG? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I was hoping to get a little advice from some of you more experienced DIY'ers. 
I've only just started to get into it and have "tried" to mix up a few different flavours. I love strong, sweet juices and have a preference for creamy/custard type stuff.
I've tried various percentages and just can't seem to hit the right note, it never tastes sweet enough and almost always just too weak.

For instance, I have tried Vanilla Custard recipes a few times using from 4% to 14%,adding EM, not adding EM and using 80% PG.
I just cant figure out what I should be doing. Is there a sweet spot I just haven't hit?

Here is my list of flavours. This is the first batch Ive bought so it's not alot but, could anyone recommend me a recipe that I could try with these particular flavours?

Vanilla Bean Ice Cream
Vanilla Custard V1
French Vanilla
Golden Pineapple
Sweet Strawberry
Choc Fudge Brownie
EM
Koolada

I would really appreciate some advice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you man, if that means anything. I was a teen when he died. I was 13 when Teen Spirit broke and am still a fan, always will be. Too many fucking scumbag, tryhards on reddit think making jokes about the death is funny, or makes them look controversial. Fucking sheep.

 All you poser cunts can thank Nirvana too for ending big hair, cock rock. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was a great conservationist and educator.
Passionate about saving endangered animals, spent shitloads on buying land to prevent land clearing of natural habitats.
Sure he was a little ecentric, but so fuckin what? He was excited and passionate about his work. He was a top bloke in my book and well missed. </TEXT>
