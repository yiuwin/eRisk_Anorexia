	<TEXT> There was a film called After Last Season.

After everyone made fun of it, he studio that made it asked theatres to burn the tapes of it, because it would be cheaper than sending them back.

[Here's a trailer for it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPPRB6ErOIU) Keep in mind this is an actual movie that was released in theatres. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the study of Lycanthropy is not by any means an exact science. Based on a number of factors including birth date (in relation to lunar cycles of course), the amount of spicy food you have ingested, and sheer luck, you could either turn into a wolf, go crazy and think you're a wolf, or just have people complementing you on your wolfish grin. 

Sorry, but i cannot be more specific without extra details. </TEXT>
