	<TEXT> Is pretty damn decent. Props to LG for the removable battery and SD slot. There's a good selection of expanded batteries for the G4 now which I didn't think anyone was selling. I'm hoping they keep these same features for the G5. Pop a hopefully good SD 820 in there and polish up the UI more and they could dominate in 2016. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you considered replacing the battery on your N5? I've taken good care of my battery and it's still giving me reasonable SOT. But I intend to replace it if I continue with this phone until the 820 phones are out.

A Moto G 2015 wouldn't be an improvement over your Nexus 5. Especially if you're in Canada and your only option is the 8gb/1gb ram. </TEXT>

You can buy the hardware you want and change the software. Then again, my first android is my current Nexus 5. I imagine it's more of a chore on other phones? Multirom makes this whole task trivial. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Multitasking and battery life to an extent. If the phone closes an app, it'll have to spend more time (and battery) reopening the app when you go back to it. This is why it's recommended to keep apps in the background as opposed to ending them via a task killer.

Honestly for $100 it's a good deal. You're not risking much if you don't like it. Just turn around and resell it for $100. </TEXT>

Gearbest has it here for $169 USD http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_188822.html but I can't figure out if it's the Americas or European version. Looking at the bands it seems like it's the Euro one. Do you know of a reliable reseller that has the Americas version? (I'm in Canada)

	<TEXT> Hence why I stashed it :) 

I guess I was being a bit sarcastic, it's really pathetic that as class we can't even be happy about our 6pc set. But DH,  barb(4 pieces), crusader, wd and wizard all have great sets.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Playing a seasonal monk, the RNG gods decided to be cruel to me.  I managed to gather 5 pieces of 1k storm set plus an alright jawbreaker before paragon 100. I threw it all in my stash without even giving the set a consideration. Furthermore I've been having trouble getting my swk shoulders, instead I've found 6 storm shoulders and 3 invokers. I'm currently playing a sub optimal swk spec with a horrendously rolled swk amulet. 

Does anyone else feel the same about our awful 6pc set? Should I even attempt to use it? What's the highest gift stormbreaker could clear?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Swk and Inna together are best used in a TR wuko build. A monk made a guide the other day. He's cleared 37 on seasonal EU using that setup.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For starters, use a 4th passive, the slot is currently empty. Switch out near death experience for something like harmony or sixth sense. Or both even,  you need a toughness boost. Also use a daibo to take advantage of sunwuko bonus, it doesn't apply to other 2 handers. 

Drop the red gem in your helm for an amethyst or diamond. Depends of your needs. I can't properly "mouseover" your gear through my phone, but these are glaring changes I can see right off the bat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Get rid of  crit hit damage as a stat, adjust game damage and health pools accordingly. Allows players to enjoy more build flexibility and deflates the numbers. 

Hell I'd love it if they tested this in seasons and found a way to roll it over to regular.  </TEXT>
