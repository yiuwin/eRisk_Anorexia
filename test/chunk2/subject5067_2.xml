	<TEXT> oh, that kinda sucks.. But thanks for a proper answer!

	<TEXT> well, thinking that i have ~3500pp less than him when he did those it's not gonna be that easy, only good thing about this is that he didnt go for scores, so he just simply played 3 different maps and therefore with enough dedication i THINK i might be able to break those scores.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, this might be stupid question but i'd really love to know. 
When i started playing ~2 years ago, my friend who was like rank 5,000 by the time played with my account just to show me what it's like (back then i had no idea about ranks so it wasn't to boost me, believe it or not). However, now that i actually would like to see my actual rank I'm not sure if i can delete the scores he got, since they're way above my current level (my top 2 ranks are from the songs he played). So yea, my question is that is there any way i could delete them and what do you guys think about this? Im sitting at ~930pp atm and ~140 came from the songs he played. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yea could be, i mean, my opinion is just one of the many but that's how i see it. And tbh i guess it doesn't really matter because USUALLY it gets the message trough, but usually things like 'loose instead of lose or your instead of you're' shouldn't be said.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they want to have any chance at pretty much anything in life from this moment on, they can't lose the match so lets just cross our fingers and toes and at this point pretty much everything we can get our crossed hands on and hope that c9 pulls their sh*t together and realizes that they're not bad. If they start the match with a 'let's just see if we hit the shots' attitude they'll get destroyed and i'll be unable to pay my rent (jk i wont be able to pay it anyways). Dont bet on this unless you're addicted and you want to lose everything so you have to buy some more skins like me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been out of this scene for waaay to long, and i don't have anything to base my opinions on other than things i've kinda learnt troughout betting so yea, i just wanna say something.

Personally i think that simply because its bo1 and clg isnt BAD no1 should place more on na'vi than what they're ready to lose. So yea, i'm gonna place low on clg and enjoy the game, na'vi will most likely win this coz of guardian etc. but clg has upset chance and i simply dont want to lose xD.

	<TEXT> How about allow people to access similiar thing as pbe, but something that would rather be made to preview tribunal cases instead of new content. If anyone here plays csgo, im talking about overwatch type thing (you can spectate people who have been reported and later state your opinion about whether he had hacks or he was being a d*ck etc.)
That would make the game so much better.

	<TEXT> Dude, the moment i was going to make a thread about 'i LOVE betting but don't have skins atm' i ran into this :D! Awesome, gonna look into it more, there was only one site that allowed you to use some ''unreal'' money for betting, but this seems alot better, also, just wondering, if you happen to lose your money what happens then? Or could there be a mode where you bet/get skins instead of money? Just curious if you could add things like that  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LunatiK have pretty decent match history so far, (im not going to count the vVv game, coz of.. reasons.) and MostlyH have not been playing that well, sure they won.. woosah? But that's not as impressive as winning clown9 (1-0) and mouseSpaz (3-1), atleast in my opinion.

Last time they played against each others MostlyH won, but they had different rosters
I feel like med on Lunatik isn't bad choice IF odds wont change, however if it goes over 75-25 small on MostlyH is smart choice. GL both teams, would love to be able to watch but sadly its in the middle of a night :'( And looking at csgonuts MostlyH's best map is mirage, just FYI :)

Also i want to say that i'm going med on Mostly, i don't think it's wise but i feel there's a chance of upset and im willing to take the risk and bet on the underdog on this one. IF YOU ARE NOT 100% SURE that its ok if you lose do not follow my bet, but my advice instead. Once again, GL (but make your own decisions dont trust to me or anyone else blindly. ATLEAST dont trust me lol)
