	<TEXT> Oh my god that is awful, I'm so sorry. That is just disgusting of them. That's exactly what I wanted to avoid in not reporting mine. I just knew they wouldn't take it seriously or even do anything about it except shame me. Why would they believe I'd been assaulted by a female doctor? So many people don't even believe females can even do that and they even shut down 'normal' cases like that so I figured they'd just assume I was pissed off because of my forced hospitalization and was just trying to cause trouble. I feel bad for not having tried to do anything about it, but I feel like it wouldn't have done any good, just would've been swept under the rug like happens so often with things like this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is why I didn't even try to report it when I was sexually assaulted last year. It seems all victims of any type of sexual assault aren't taken seriously by many people, not just law enforcement or aren't even believed. But it does seem like it can be even worse if you're a man or if you were hurt by a women. I've heard terrible stories where men have tried to report being raped and ended up getting arrested themself and one where a women who was raped by another women when they were quite young was forced by a therapist to write an apology letter to the rapist. It's really quite sad...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *SJW impersonation*- It's ok to hurt white men because they are all horrible oppressors and all of them are rapist sexist swine! It isn't racist or sexist for *us* to hate them all because white men should have no rights at all! How can they even be considered human!? They should be slaughtered in the streets like the pigs they are!

/end impersonation

This is fucking sick. How could anyone decide to *murder* 16 innocent *human beings* simply because of their race and gender? I do so hope this isn't real, it would be such a horrible hate-crime and an awful tragedy. I hope whoever said this doesn't get to go through with it. What sort of monster thinks that way? People like this disgust me. Bleh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It cute how the feminist SJWs who claim to hate rape so much and support rape victims so entirely, also *completely deny the existence* of male victims or female rapists, or if they deign to acknowledge them, it's just to invalidate them or down-play what happened. The person who wrote this analogy doesn't even realize that they victim blame and doubt basically all victims of sexual crimes unless the victim is a female who was hurt by a male. More hypocrisy. But who cares about hypocrisy when there's pAtRiArChY!?11!? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate how the feminist idea of rape culture only includes male rapists and female victims. It's really rough on the male victims and victims of female assailants, as it encourages the myth that they don't even exist. But they just brush them off because "WOMEN ARE PERFECT!! They do not commit sex crimes! Only
icky male swine do! And men do not get raped, because those pigs *always* want it!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh my god I cannot even describe how infuriating this is. Male rape victims suffer so much, *just like every other victim*. And yeah, they do get victim blamed and invalidated, like *what this post says* What sort of sick bitch thinks like that? And what about the victims of *female assailants*? Did the sick sexist bitch who wrote this shit not think it through *at all*? Rape is not a tool of the "patriarchy" it happens to and hurts people regardless of gender and has been committed by members of both genders. How can it be a tool of the patriarchy if it is used by women and men alike against both women and men? It's a tool of *assholes* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once met a woman who told me I was a "disgrace to the entire female gender" because I was "encouraging the oppression of women everywhere and selling out to societal standards to please men" simply because I shave my body hair. Does that count as "feminazi caricature"? She scolded me for it for quite some time and informed me I wasn't a real women and that I shouldn't work so hard to please "pig-men" and got really pissed when I pointed out that I have a right to do as I wish with my body, and that just because she's happy being hairy, doesn't mean I want to be perpetually itchy and uncomfortable, and that I want to feel pretty for *me* not to please anyone else. 

And another told me I should be ashamed of myself for having a white male boyfriend because "how can you be loyal to someone who works so hard to oppress us!?"

There is no catch all.* A 5-foot-tall female with a desk job doesn't need anywhere near as many calories as a 6-foot-6 male bike messenger, for example.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sorry something so horrible happened and I'm so sorry that people reacted in such an insensitive and just *wrong* way. I was molested by a women and I've had to deal with similar reactions as well, but not the congratulations (which must be *infuriating*) more just they deny that it could have even happened. It's just not fair for people to brush things like this off just because of the gender of the perpetrator. It's wrong and it's just so awful that things like this are invalidated just because of the gender of the person doing and it's disgusting that that cab driver seemed to blame you for it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely hate when people say "when you have children", "once you're a mother", "Someday once you get pregnant you'll see", things like that, and then act horribly offended when I say "I'm never having children", "I would never be a mother", "If I do get pregnant I sure as hell won't be for long" in response. It is my body and I have a right to never allow it to be ravaged by a baaaaaayyyybeeee. If I want to live free and do as I please, have time and money and happiness with my SO to travel, have nice things, and enjoy being together, not an empty, exhausted, ruined life in which we would be nothing but baby-raising zombies with dead eyes and broken spirits who would be able to do nothing but care for a helpless crotchfuit. 

I value my happiness far to much to ever do something so unpleasant as have a baby. I want to be free and happy and well-rested and full of life (my own life, not a parasitic hellspawn with no purpose but to ruin my life). 

I have heard *every single mother I have ever met* complain about *all* aspects of motherhood, but yet they still try to force it on me. No thank you, I don't want your purposeless, struggle-filled, miserable life, your body that will never be the same or you forever-tired soul. I don't want to endear the miseries of pregnancy, having a baby tear through my vagina and after causing me so much pain demand all of my time and resources. 

I am childfree and no one can change that. It is my decision. It is my right. It is the only right path for me and I will not change to appease their ideas of what a 'real women' does to 'fulfill her purpose'. I am a free-thinking human being and I am very capable of making the decision to not bear children.

Perhaps the reason they try to force breeding onto everyone is because misery loves company. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps I misunderstood what you said. In your comment "But I made a sarcastic comment so the opposite is never true" it seemed like you were saying that sometimes wearing certain clothes *does* mean that someone wants to be touched, and that you were saying my comment meant it never does, so I said in my reply to you that I didn't mean that that is never true, just that it's not enough to go on. I'm truly sorry. I'm quite tired right now and I tend to word things in a very confusing manor as is. I've probably just causes a misunderstanding again, for which I apologize.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was already head-over-heels for him and had been basically since we met. I had been hoping for so long that someday he'd tell me that he loved me and I was just so happy when he finally did. It was great. And we didn't have to deal with all of the first-date awkwardness because we were already so close. It was just a really nice smooth transition. There wasn't a lot of change really, because we were already such a big part of each other's lives and it's nice to be best friends *and* lovers too. I wouldn't want it any other way. </TEXT>
