	<TEXT> I think that people calling these "amateur" / "Unimaginative" is silly. He was an novice, he was applying to art school, he wasn't a master painter. If this was his MFA show yah, I'd agree, but during the time at the academy, if he got in, don't you think he would have grown, his subjects could have evolved. It's like if people only looked at the early  work of all artist and judged them based on that. Hitler probably would have gotten better, would he be an artist whose name know? Probably not but he could have been good enough to make it as an artist   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've actually had a couple Redditers recognize me IRL based on stuff I've posted on Reddit (posted pics on Reddit of my artwork, they saw me selling them IRL, this has happened about 4-5 times) and all of them have been really normal people, and more often than not there is some form of "I assume everyone on reddit is weird IRL, but your normal" conversation which is exchanged. 

Point being, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to meet some Redditors, but the ones I've happened to come across in the wild, have all been normal, non nerdy/ non socially awkward people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well he isn't being charged with a crime, there no talk of criminal punishment. this point is like a high schooler who gets suspended in class for swearing at his teacher defends his actions by citing the Constitution and his freedom of speech. the fact is in schools, there are academic/ behavioral guildlines set up, often outlining repercussions for those guidelines. and if you break those rules, things will happen.

If you were the principal of this school, and this happened at your school how would you respond? if you do nothing it sets a very slippery precedent, not to mention your superintendent is going be giving you some serious shit for a long time about losing control of your students. so you take action.

A) you still let the student graduate, i don't think this should even be up to debate, he put in his time did the work, his idiocy doesn't mean he shouldnt graduate, 

B) you don't give him an official diploma. this really doesn't affect the student, rarely (if ever) do you need to show you diploma, and if you do, you can just get a copy of your transcript. This shows that you (the principal) taking the matter seriously, and sends a message stunts like this will be taken seriously.

C) He is banned from property: ok, who cares, he'll miss his 10 year HS reunion.... who gives a shit. 

all in all, i'd say yes. his punishment does fit the "crime". there was actually little to no actual repercussion, and yet this still shows that incidents like this won't be taken lightly.

	<TEXT> Honestly anyone that has doodled has done something very akin to this. It is one of those things that isn't that complicated to do, and looks kinda cool when its repeated in a big enough area. to me these typically just look like the inside of a bored highschool math student's notebook. 

I think the best thing in this piece is the beginning of varied the line weight  around the circle of the bottom right hand corner. Its beginning to create a focal point in the piece,. though i think that the mass of very dark lines in the bottom right corner are too much. especially the glob in the tip or the corner. </TEXT>

Yah, thats pretty much exactly what i've been doing. I'm fairly new to the multi block world, but basically what i've been doing is carving the key plate (the black layer) printing that onto a sheet of my crappy paper thats registered just like all my actual printing paper, run it thru the press, take the key plate off, put as new block in the same place as the key plate, run it thru, and Boom, you have the exact same image on plate #2, after that, i'll roughly go over everything with a pencil other wise i'll smudge it and loose the lines.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tried to reply to everyone but got kinda banned for spamming ( was just trying to reply to everyone's replies, not spam, but w/e) so I ended up pm-ing people, which I could only contact so many people, and those PMs didn't include everyone that up voted the "I want this" comments or any of the reposts. Made some in sales, but it was also a lot of free publicity I didn't really get, again just a personal experience, but a after that incident, I try to watermark (though less obnoxiously) anytime I post on a larger sub. 

Now I'm not saying I love large obnoxious watermarks, but they are there to stop that from happening. You could put it in the corner(which I do) but.... A) people won't see it, even though it's clearly right there B) some will just crop it off and repost it with crediting you. It's just the nature of the beast when it comes to the internet.

	<TEXT> So, i'd consider myself a bit of an artist and can chime in here.

 one day I posted a print i made on reddit, with my normal signature, NBD, after about a day it had 400k+ views and was being passed around the internet, on FB and a bunch of other misc sites, with no credit to me at all. now i was really honored that people thought my stuff was worth checking out, but then it was like, come on guys, at least tell them that it was me that did it. I mean I'm a poor artist, and even if they said, "the guy made this thing, check out other work there" maybe someone would check out my work and buy something... i mean even though someone is an artist doesn't mean they don't need money to survive as well. watermarks make it some that doesn't happen as much.

and because i'm sure i'll get asked heres a link: http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1xzpz7/saw_this_pic_and_had_to_make_a_print_of_it/

	<TEXT> I do have to say, I don't think you can blame the press for cracking your board

Have to agree, its like blaming a hammer you nail went in crooked. My guess is 

A) your pressure was too high

B) your board was slightly warped making a slight " ) " and you put in the board the wrong way. 

C) the print gods hate you and just didn't want your dog to print... but i'm guessing it was A or B

Also, i think that your multi block print is the weakest of the three. although it is registered fairly well, i think the overall linework/ detail is lacking. if you look at the elephant, and the linework of that, use that as a key plate, then add color to enhance the print, i think it would help you a lot...

ex: http://www.tugboatprintshop.com/INFO_process.htm look at some of those and how they use a key plate, and then add color. i think it will help you if you think about it that way. Have color accent your work, don't make it have to carry it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> another nice print. i think the first shirt (the one thats modeled) is the best, it has a nice since of balance/ symmetry (without being actually symmetrical) but honestly not really a fan of either the all triangle or all (+) compositions. the spacing between the prints seems rather inconsistent (like the (+) one the between the middle 2 is like 0.5 but the distance either up and down to the above or below print is about 2.0 (i have no idea the actual size so i used arbitrary number)) 

so just throwing this out there. make a square and a circle, print them clockwise as triangle circle  X (+)  Square post on /r/gaming and rake in the money </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SUCCCCCESSSSS!!!! 

also, nice print, the line work is really nice, i do kind of wish there was some tonal quality in the top/middle backround be cause the blacks/ greys in the bottom part are so nice and really help the whale pop. where as the top of the ship is a little to close (tonally) to the backround.... thats really nit-picky, but just keep that in mind for next time, but all in all this is a nice print, and you should be proud of it. 

don't feel like image on is cheating in the least, is it intaglio? no but its just as valid of a process.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> still not right, if your posting an album/ picture from imgur, just copy the address on the top of the album (don't hit the share to reddit button) and then go on reddit (either the front page, or here in /r/printmaking) and hit the submit a link button, put you title, your URL and put it the printmaking sub. before you submit it to if you want to check, just try to open your URL in a new tab to make sure it'll work.
