	<TEXT> I was driving home from a very long morning shift at work, I was listening to local radio. When bohemian rhapsody started playing I, naturally, started singing along. I was nearing my house when, as any person of my generation would, I started head banging at the appropriate moment in the song. As I looked up to check for traffic I saw the most awesome sight. The woman coming towards me was also head banging along to bohemian rhapsody.  </TEXT>
