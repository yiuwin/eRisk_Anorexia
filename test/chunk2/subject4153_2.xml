	<TEXT> Whoa. I fell in love with New Balances in high school and bought the same model 3 times again when they'd wear out enough. I just want comfortable shoes, I'm not trying to wow anyone, and I knew what had worked well in the past. And just last fall when I was looking for new shoes, I found the Skechers store and their memory foam offerings and fell in love again. 

I felt like having some more options, so I picked up yet another new pair of New Balances(a new model though!) over the Black Friday weekend. They feel very form fitting and I think they'll be as comfortable as my old NBs, but I'm like you really, it's hard to go back to anything else after having the memory foam soles. I probably would've grabbed another set of Skechers if they had been on sale instead.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After decades of being able to go, "I think I'll play a game" and 30 seconds later you are playing that game, it's just an annoying thing that gamers didn't have to deal with before. There's a workaround, absolutely, but it's something that didn't before, and still really doesn't, need to be worked around.

Like others have said, it's not like the game..or jesus, applications like Netflix or Hulu...are(in most cases) completely broken without these urgent updates. You should be able to choose to skip the update at that exact moment if you'd like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, as a fan I guys this is a good thing though it does feel a bit excessive. I certainly can't imagine it being good business-wise. When's the last time a Stephen King movie was a blockbuster? Ever? The Stand isn't going to do Twilight or Hunger Games numbers. So what are the chances the projects gets shot down after, like, movie 2? I don't think as much would be spent, or it's expected to do as well as those series, but clearly they're hoping to capture some of that magic and spread a big box office across for films...and I'm afraid they're going to get a disappointing surprise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could be victim of this just with myself sometimes, I'd think I shouldn't complain because I didn't have it as bad as others. But what really turned me around on that aspect of it was reading the idea of "Not being sad because someone's had a worse day is just like not being happy because someone had a better day."

No one ever does that, no one ever dismisses all of your personal happy moments just because some millionaire out there is flying somewhere on his private jet with his supermodel girlfriend...so why should negative feelings be treated like that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Big agreement from me too. I haven't listened to the last..3,4...maybe 5 episodes, it just doesn't feel the same at all. It feels like a property that's been taken over by another creative team that can only try to imitate the original. It's hard to believe that what the show is currently was something always in the writers' minds at the beginning, and not largely a response to the, oddly immense, Tumblr following and obsession with only the "shipping" aspect of any show/movie/book/whatever. 

Thins always evolve, for sure, but listening to the early episodes I never would have thought it was the kind of show that if eventually given the live theater treatment would have the audience whooping and awwing. 

I liked when it felt more mysterious and yeah, a bit scary and disturbing. I liked when Cecil felt like a genuine radio personality and not an actor playacting the current stories. When he seemed a simple, faceless reporter of the news. I liked when every recurring character didn't make actual appearances on the show.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, good video. This is what really repels me from embracing the show as much as I used to. Ultimately, it boils down to being a teen soap opera with supernatural window dressing. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's been a teen soap opera from the beginning, but lately it's starting to betray its own rules and shun the supernatural side i nthe name of teen soap opera-ness. I've always especially hated how the Originals are treated. They're mostly all shitheads, but whine seemingly oblivious about not being accepted and because Klaus and Rebecca are cute they overcome the baggage of ya know killing hundreds (some close to the main characters) of people in cold blood and characters aren't as bothered.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just thinking yesterday as I caught up on the last bit of season 39, trying to remember who overlapped with Andy Samberg, that a graphic like this would be great and I was imagining that I'd actually seen something like it somewhere online. What I was picturing was formatted a bit differently, the seasons were on the X-axis and the cast members ran down the Y and the chart was just a grid with colors filled in to show each performer's tenure. Not as informative as this, for sure, but a bit quicker at a glance to see who starred with who. Did I make this up in my mind or does anyone else know what I'm talking about?

Amazing work on this! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The main problem would be their story is confined by reality. They chose to swim in semi-historical waters and are therefore somewhat beholden to honoring what actually happened. A prohibition story would naturally be structured around the period before the amendment was repealed, they couldn't just push that ahead a few years to suit a 5-season plan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's good to hear, I've been tempted to pick up some Adventure Time stuff but have been turned away by Jazzwares. Pretty much everything they've made for the last few years has been reviewed poorly for having thick sloppy paint(on items that should be on the easier side as far as paint schemes), awful seam lines on characters that by their nature are less forgiving to such ugliness, and weird or useless articulation that makes them prone to breaking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think, as unhelpful as it might sound, is just to keep using it as much as possible, even just to navigate the OS. I remember for the first few months, feeling coordinated, just learning how to draw without the "paper" and the utensil being connected, was a huge challenge. I think that's the first big hurdle for most folks, get used to that feeling and your muscle memory will set in and your arm and hand will naturally know the nuances to create a broad stroke or light line just like you would do with a pencil on paper.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a programmer, but I don't understand how an engine could simply, flatly, for all eternity never allow certain features. And SimCity 2013 was also impossible to be played offline according to EA, so I take the statement with a shaker full of salt. It sounds exactly like non-sense they use to fool the more casual players so they can miraculously spring things like pools on those players in future expansions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I don't mean to discount his work just cause it's on the more boring, technical side right now. I guess my comment's intent is mostly that there are still years to go and plenty of time for it to get overwhelming and him to abandon the project. Or there's still years to go and I have plenty of other things to keep myself occupied with besides waiting for updates on FreeRCT. I'm just leery of getting invested and hyped up by even AAA-projects when they are years out, that doesn't really ever turn out well, even if the game is well made.  </TEXT>

At the most it's a very small team. And so I'm amazed they've kept motivated after so long, but at this point they still have, if nothing else, thousands and thousands of pieces of art to make.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watched live, but I was also pretty entrenched in forum discussions and so there was always the danger of some jackass thinking it would be hilarious to post done rumors or set photos unsolicited to spoil try to spoil everyone. I managed to not get really barraged with spoilers, but the worst thing that happened was probably when someone posted blurry on set photos of Sawyer in a Dharma jumpsuit weeks or maybe even a couple months before that was revealed on the show. </TEXT>

But it's interesting/frustrating that you go from the police and court having their hands completely tied by honor until sufficient evidence is presented and process is followed to create a piece of paper that says it's okay to simply enter a home to being able to burst into your home guns drawn, potentially, based on nothing.  </TEXT>

I've talked a bit about it over there, but always happy to talk more and answer any queries people might have about it. It's been a fun project, still slowly chipping away at it. Hopefully have it finished in another month or so maybe.  </TEXT>
