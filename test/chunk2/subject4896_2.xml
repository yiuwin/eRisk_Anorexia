	<TEXT> It's just weird to me that 3-4 cities civ could be stronger that one with 10+ just because the science and culture needed to progress is getting bigger with every new city. I know that Vox Populi does something about that but I would rather play vanilla rule set. I think than VP is just too crazy and overpowered compared to vanilla.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be much cheaper and faster to just hire an actor to play civ ledaer. Just buy some fancy clothes and record few scenes on greenbox rather than create 3d model and animate it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What is wrong with RNG in Civ V. When I choose random leaders I almost always get Egypt, Brasil, Sweden and Pacal as my neighbours. It's getting boring and I don't want to choose AIs manually. </TEXT>
