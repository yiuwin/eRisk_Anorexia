	<TEXT> Go take a fucking picture. You've had thousands of years to do that. That is litteraly all you have to do to prove your argument. While you are busy worrying about shit the rest of us figured out hundreds of years ago. the rest of us are exploring space and improving the standard of living for all of us. My god you people are dense and the only reason flat earthers are gaining popularity is that in todays age of misinformation is that it's much easier for the snake oil sales men to peddle their bull crap to you morons. </TEXT>
