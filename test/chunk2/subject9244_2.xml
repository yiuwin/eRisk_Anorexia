	<TEXT> *Narcos* is fine. I think if it wasn't on Netflix its response would be rather nondescript. (I do think the young, male Reddit demo has an outsize tendency towards it that isn't reflective of the whole, too.) I heard someone describe *Narcos* as a filmed version of Pablo Escobar's wikipedia page, which sounded bang-on to me. It's fine, I can't blame anyone who finds it entertaining, but to me there's so much more interesting things on the landscape right now.

P.S. Agree on *Stranger Things* 100% </TEXT>

It would help if we had a better backup center than Aron Baynes. Maybe someone like that skilled 7-3 guy that played for San Antonio last season. What ever happened to him? I think his name started with a 'B'. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, he's flashed some really nice stuff so far this year. *Flashed*. As far as I'm concerned, anything that avoids a hook shot is progress, and that includes getting to his up-and-unders, step throughs, etc. when his back is to the basket. But most exciting -- because it's most new, probably -- is his face-up game from the mid-post area. He truly is a remarkable movement athlete at his size -- it might be his greatest asset as a player -- so leveraging that as best he can in his offensive opportunities by attacking guys off the floor might be his most promising route towards efficiency down there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the weaknesses section of his DraftExpress profile:
 Johnson was downright dreadful as a finisher around the basket as a freshman, hitting just 40% of his half-court shot attempts inside the paint this season, one of the worst rates among any prospect in our Top-100. He isn't very explosive from a vertical standpoint, and had a tough time adjusting to the physicality of the college game, simply trying to beast his way through defenders like he was usually able to in high school.

	<TEXT> I will say though, he's going to need to shoot well to succeed in the NBA. I knew he wasn't an explosive athlete, but man, he really isn't an explosive athlete. He's never going to be a good finisher near the rim; I can't imagine his drives ever becoming much of a threat. Defending 3s and 4s, shooting -- I think that's primarily what he's going to have to do as a good NBA player. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stanley had a terrible camp and preseason. He was forcing a lot of stuff, trying to do too much (like a lot of young guys I'm sure). He seems to be out of the dog house now in SVG's eyes, but his play doesn't look overly comfortable as a role player at the moment. Kind of resembles a neutered dog on offense a bit. He's defending well, however. I think he'll be fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not just that. He loses interest if he's not getting his post touches. But a catch-22 to that is he'll also hang his head if he's not converting those post touches, where he remains terribly inefficient. It's an overall issue with him, and it's been there since day-one. You can see/hear SVG battling with it each day, delicately and not. The hope has been it would, and is, slowly getting better, though "slowly" is definitely the operative word there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd argue that would have been an accurate perception, but the tiny sample size of this season (3 games) begs to differ a bit. For anyone who hasn't seen, Drummond is showing a nice face-up game right now that already looks more comfortable than his back-to-the-basket one ever has (of which he is wisely using much more step-through-type moves in lieu of jump-hooks).

He's realizing he is a better athlete and quicker than just about everyone that's going to guard him and taking advantage. I don't know how useful it will end up being -- his pick-and-roll gravity is still his best attribute and the team's bread-and-butter on offense, and DET has other probably more effient offensive options -- but it's fun to watch nonetheless and an encouraging sight.

edit: i don't read well </TEXT>

I don't want to listen to cold, emotionless analysts all the time. I like emotion, I come to these shows/pods to be educated as well as entertained, and Amin offers both. Why so serious, man? </TEXT>

 Numerous people told me theyd heard Bleacher Report offered Lowe one million dollars annually, though they were almost as quick to add that that seemed ridiculous. For comparison, the New York Post reported that Yahoo is paying Adrian Wojnarowski $8 million over four years to run The Vertical, though an informed source told me the deal was closer to $6 million for four years, plus stock options. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Am I the only one who actually really likes ESPN's NBA coverage? Lowe, the TrueHoop guys, Kevin Pelton, Ramona Shelburne, *The Jump*, even studio guys like Jalen Rose.

I get most of my news through Twitter these days so fortunately I don't have to navigate ESPN's site too much, but I really enjoy the NBA content they provide.

Also, is it safe to say ESPN has really nice Synergy and Second Spectrum (and the like) resources that other outlets don't? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boban is going to have to crack the rotation first. The plan as of now is that Baynes is the backup center this year, and next season, if Baynes opts out (Pistons seem overly confident about this; some fans remain a bit skeptical) Boban will assume the backup role. Now, I'd assume there's a healthy dose of a matchup-based strategy going on with Baynes vs. Boban this year coming in spelling Andre, but Baynes has a huge leg up right now overall. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They've also allowed the highest yards/carry against in the NFL (5.13). Unfortunately when playing the Lions defense there is no bad option. Currently in the red-zone teams are choosing to pass against DET (at an 84% clip, highest in NFL), and they're scoring at a very high rate doing it (47% of those passes, second-highest). They don't have to run in that area of the field, but if they did I imagine they'd be quite successful, too. </TEXT>
