	<TEXT> Just read this book last year around this time.  I LOVED it so much more than I expected.  But there is one chapter in that book, somewhere in the teens, I don't remember which, that was the most tedious thing I've ever read in my life.  All of the video game and fish descriptions we've previously experienced got nothing on this. 

*Checked my Goodreads review* It's Chapter 11.  Quoted from my review: 
I was *this* close to giving the book a three, based on chapter 11 alone, but as the story progressed and the finale approached, I forgot all about how tedious (though significant) that particular section of the book was, and just fell back in love with Wilde's prose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few weeks ago I was doing some stuff at work that required my computer to run without me interfering with it, so I spent some time on a site that pointed out all of the differences between the film and the book.  I had just seen the film the night before, and was really pleased to see that while there were a number of differences, for the most part, it was a great adaptation, that didn't leave TOO much out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hated that about the movie, to be honest.  They didn't work Bell in nearly as well as I thought they did in the book, so when he has this monologue at the end of the film, it just feels like the whole film was a set up for that one monologue.  In the book, you always realize you're reading Bell's story,and he punctuates it with this one event that really changed the way he looked at everything. </TEXT>

Maybe the striking power will come in time, I don't know, but I think the fight IQ makes up for it, and I'd REALLY like to see him fight a ranked opponent.  Not sure why he almost seems to have been downgraded after picking Jordan apart the way he did.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Started really getting serious about a lifestyle change last January, after a few years of yo-yoing.  At my worst, a few years back, I was at 190.  I started 2015 at 170.  Got down to 135.  I am 5'1.5", so I'm now "overweight" rather than obese.  I hit that weight in July.  I didn't lose another pound the rest of the year.  It was maddening.  Then the holidays hit and I didn't go to the gym for two months.  Got terrified that I'd gained back too much weight to cope with.  

Anyways, my point is, I started reading here, and it really got me motivated.  I've been back on my regular gym schedule for a few days in a row, now, and I'm super hyped to be there again.  Turned out I only gained back about 6 or 7 pounds in the holiday months (one of my problems is that I seem to gain weight back REALLY quickly if I don't stick to my calorie goals).  I'm already back down two pounds from my new peak, so I'm really happy to be back on the train.  

Here's to hoping I can get down to my target weight before my 10 year high school reunion in August ;). 

Thank you all so much for the motivation!  </TEXT>

But, in general, I try not to eat back my exercise calories, anyways, unless it was one of my double days at the gym, because...doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose?  MFP actually had a decent article about this on the app a few months back, about whether or not you should eat back the calories.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See, this is the kind of thing where I think the logic of not focusing too strongly on the numbers is important.  

I'm not saying the numbers are wrong, but if you're feeling better, and you're losing weight, take that as a positive in the right direction, and don't overwhelm yourself with the target.  If you keep doing what you're doing, and focus on that, the rest would hopefully come in time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny because true. 

It's amusing that I could find myself so actively disliking the reading experience of a book, but still coming away from it feeling like I really enjoyed it.  What a strange little story. 

I'll never forgive how short the chapter with the poulps was, though.  That was the one thing I remembered from the movie way back when, and I was looking forward to it, and it was over so suddenly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having already seen the film (and been one of the few people to not love it), I was very anxious upon realizing how close an adaptation of the book the film is.  

A good chunk of the way in, now, my fears are assuaged.  This book is wonderful.  It's also making me believe that if I were to watch the film again, I'd change my mind about it as well. 

I've been forced to split my time between an audio book version, and reading it myself, as I got very behind slogging through 20KLUTS.  This has proved to be a bit tedious, as the audiobook version is a little hard to follow, due to the strange way this book is written.  But, that being said, that coinflip scene is EVEN BETTER than in the film, and the film scene is already incredible. 

Yes, I am enjoying this quite a bit, indeed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Still Alice. 

In general just the thought of Alzheimers depresses me, but with it being a story about early onset, I just completely lost it watching the movie. 

About halfway through I was nearly sobbing aloud. My husband kept asking if I wanted to turn the movie off, but I couldn't stand not knowing what happens, so I spent the next 40 minutes having various crying fits until the nightmare was finally over. 

It was not my favorite movie watching experience. Great movie though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I road the ride at Disney...World... I think..21 years ago.  Vague fleeting memories of that, and single clips from the film are all I can remember of what it's about. 

I don't know if this translation is weird or what, but they're talking about Narwhals and I didn't realize they had ANYTHING to do with this (even if it is just a theory, I think I remember what the monster ends up looking like), so just on a Freakazoid level, this is amusing me. </TEXT>

I hated that he threw it in at the end, just like the reveal about Aech, seemingly as though he thought about it, AS he was writing, and figured, "well, I'll just add it to the story now, we don't need any kind of clues that this is happening in the real world, to maybe clue the reader in to the larger universe this is all happening in." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've said a lot of negative things about this book already, so I'll save it for now, I just have one big thing I want to get across: 

Saying this is good for a YA novel is NOT a good enough excuse.  

You want to know what's a great YA novel rooted in sci-fi, similar in theme to this one?  Ender's Game.  

You DON'T have to sacrifice substance to be geared at younger readers. Ender's is a *fantastic* book.  As an adult, I was blown away by it.  There was nothing about it that felt like it was lacking, in order to be a youth-aimed story.  

This book felt like it used the YA tag as an excuse to avoid substance.  There's no excuse for that. 

In short, as I've said so many times before: This book could have been good.  It wasn't. But Spielberg will very likely make something incredible out of it.  So there's that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He talks about being able to just pick up a computer, from an early age, and program it.  The only time he talks about learning in his early years are with those children's games...I can't imagine he learned programming from that.  

It just bothers me when an author says something like, "I found a laptop and reprogrammed it to do x." or "I hacked it to let me listen to music." 

It's just kinda lazy.  It is what it is.  It's not like THAT was the one thing that turned me off the book. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mentioned this in another conversation, but I had completely expected [Shoto and Daito](/s "to turn out to just be American's who were REALLY into Japanese culture.  That's how they were written.")  

I've studied Japanese for the better part of my life now.  Interact with many Japanese people, have been to Japan, etc...this depiction was so cringe-inducing, I could hardly continue reading once their characters were introduced.  

It's one thing to have them say ~san.  But that seppuku line drop was potentially the worst sentence I've ever read in any book ever. </TEXT>

I can't stand books/movies/whatever, that introduce a character as complete computer geniuses, without any means whatsoever for them to become such. 
 
Wade quickly tells us at the beginning of the story that he's just able to do these things, even though he's from a poor background, and would have had no means with which to learn any of it.  There's no explanation, no throwaway dialogue where he says something like, "I spent all of my time online learning to code." Nothing.  He's just great at it, cause Wade is awesome, and we all need to just accept that. </TEXT>

As for the "worldbuilding", there wasn't much of that at all since Cline just took a bunch of stuff that already existed and just threw it at the wall to see what stuck. 

I was really disappointed in the book, but I think it'll make a killer movie in Spielberg's hands.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But if you look at his fight record since the four fight losing streak, I don't know how you aren't impressed with it.  In 12 fights, he had one loss and one NC.  The NC would've been a win, and the one loss was slightly controversial, in that he got ROCKED by a hit that was possibly long after the bell. Even then, just the one loss to Johnson in four and a half years, as a heavyweight, is impressive.  </TEXT>
