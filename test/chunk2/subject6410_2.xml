	<TEXT> You raised some good points there. I would think that any civilisation capable of interplanetary travel would have overcome ecological issues first.. Although perhaps space travel technology had been introduced to Naboo from outside at some early point. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> People getting hungry from planetary blockades. How is this possible? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Correct me if im wrong, but in TPM, the people of Naboo go hungry because of the TF's blockade. 

And so in the latest Rebels episode "Wings of the Master", a planetary blockade is causing people to go hungry.

How is it actually possible for people to go hungry on a planetary level? can these planets not support themselves? Naboo seems lush with forests and vast plains that could be used for farming so im not sure why a whole planet could not sustain its own population. Any thoughts?

As much as i loved Jazz Jackrabbit i could never understand why he was incorporated into Star Wars.

Also, for those interested, do a search for "Rabbit" on wookieepedia for some... interesting EU content you never knew existed

	<TEXT> Han Solo + Lyke Skywalker + beard = Kyle Katarn

In my opinion, the coolest character in the whole Star Wars story.

I think for a lot of people, the un-canonization of Kyle Katarn was one of the biggest losses to Star Wars. When many of us begun our own journey's in the Star Wars universe, it was in Kyles boots. It was his lightsaber that we first wielded and his Bryar pistol that we used to shoot down our first stormtroopers. Removing him from the universe was like removing us. Because really, it wasnt Kyle that entered the Valley of the Jedi to fight Jerec or train under Luke Skywalker at the Jedi Academy.. It was us fans that did that.

Will Kyle ever be brought back into canon? I would like to think so, but i know that he wont be. Lets just hope we get a similar character like him in future content. In the mean time... one Ruby bliels  please

	<TEXT> I've thought about this... and i have a theory.

If JJ has done this right, the situation of forces users would be different to the previous 6 films. Specifically, we wouldnt have a "many-to-few" jedi:Sith ratio as in the PT trilogy, nor will we have a "two-to-two" jedi:sith ratio in the OT trilogy.

What JJ would want to do is potentially have a group of Sith (Knights of Ren etc...) vs a group of Jedi. 

Think about it... have we ever seen a group of 5-10 Jedi ever take on a group of 5-10 sith in a Star Wars film? we have not but who would honestly NOT want to see that happen on screen? I personally believe, this is what we have been set up for. the "Knights of Ren" will at some point, take on a group of 5-10 Jedi who have trained under Luke in hiding since ROTJ. 

To have only one or two Jedi again would just be boring.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Or do you think that we are just going to get stand alone books like we have until now?

Personally, i'd prefer the most important elements of the star wars story be told in trilogies. With stand alone books to supplement these. 

Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ve been thinking this all along. Especially when it was reported that Kylo wouldnt be your typical "moustache twirling bad guy". If he turns to the light side, i hope he retains his costume. would be a nice touch

Id also like to see Finn or Rey turn to the dark side and Kylo turn to the light (perhaps in this film or in a later one). Have a bit of a switcheroo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think i know why..

People dont want *new* Star Wars content. They just want the *same* content re-released so they can feel the same when as they once did when they where kids. (tbh there is nothing wrong with that but trust me, the same old stuff gets boring. Even i rarely bother to watch ANH or ESB or ROTJ since i saw these movies 200 times when i was younger)

When the cross-guard lightsaber was revealed, everyone went crazy because it wasnt (what they saw in their minds) as the standard Sith red lightsaber. But funnily, this debate happened once before... about 15 years ago.. over a double-sided lightsaber.

People were like "that isnt a real lightsaber" and "how can one fight with that without stabbing one-self" and so on and so forth.

fast foward 14 years later and everyone loves double-bladed lightsabers. They are just as "Star-Warsy" than standard one-blade lightsabers.

Moral of the story... forget the politics, forget the internet, forget the  criticism.. just watch the movie with an open mind. Watch the movie through the eyes of a child and not that of an adult and you will be satisfied with whatever daft things get shown.
