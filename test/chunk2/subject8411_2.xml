	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Please post all LFF posts here so that there is a centralized place for Faction leaders to come to view potential recruits as well as to help reduce clutter on the subreddit.


You are also invited to post your LFF submission on the LFF Shotbow Forum though most people don't look on there: http://shotbow.net/forum/threads/63487/


Here are some tips and tricks from myself:


Trust no one. People are dicks. People will backstab you. Even long term friends will backstab you. Keep a hidden chest somewhere. Expect it to get XRay'd anyhow.


Use the Mumble! Hop on, talk to people. Yes, most people will hide in their faction chats. Sit in one of the neutral ones. Demand people come talk to you in game! Unless you're horribly annoying, someone almost certainly will, and voice chat friends are a lot more reliable than random text friends. People feel guilty when they can hear you go 'GOD FUCKING DAMNIT' and start crying, for some reason.


Yes we know you came from reddit. We all came from reddit. But this server has history and if you don't know what 'Greysoul' is, who 'Lannister', rrowland, or camxd were, or what the Triforce was, then you don't understand the undercurrent of old politics that run back to the old days of the server and you should, again, not trust anyone because you never know who has a vendetta

GET FOOD. YOU CAN STARVE TO DEATH.. You start with a fucking fishing pole, do not bitch to us about how you're starving to death for fucks sake. DO NOT depend on finding random peaceful food mobs, you will die. Fish. Fish like your life depends on it before you leave spawn. Ask in spawn if anyone has a melon slice they'd give you, because Melon is one of the fastest growing, easily grown foods in the game and it will become your lifeline.


Use the Mumble! Hop on, talk to people. Yes, most people will hide in their faction chats. Sit in one of the neutral ones. Demand people come talk to you in game! Unless you're horribly annoying, someone almost certainly will, and voice chat friends are a lot more reliable than random text friends. People feel guilty when they can hear you go 'GOD FUCKING DAMNIT' and start crying, for some reason.


The ores that appear everywhere? Those are Ore Obfuscator. It's an Anti-XRay that's made to confuse XRay mods / Skins by making stone appear as fake examples of random materials. Do not be pissed off about how the server stole your diamond. It was never diamond in the first place. It was always stone. You'll get used to the trolling.


Chances are no one 'Hacked' into your base. You probably built a wall in Wilderness, or left a hole. Remember, you can Ender Pearl THROUGH pretty much any hole, from half blocks to doors to, in the next update, staircases. Don't accuse people of hacking. Ask politely how they got in. If they're dicks about it, shrug and write their name down on the 'I will fucking kill you later' list.


You can find enough diamond for armor and a sword within an hour. No we're not lying. No we're not hacking. A decent amount of it is luck, but a bigger amount is knowing where to look. Get food, get wood, they're the only things you need underground you can't find there. Dig at y = 12, this is right above lava level so you won't magically dig into it unless you're unlucky. Learn to strip mine. If you find a natural cavern, explore it. )(EDIT)( Yes, I know that y=12 is pretty tapped out, but it's still one of the best levels. Hence why strip-mining is usually better than cave exploration, because at least strip-mining you know no one's been through that stripmine level before, despite the constantly running into other people's tunnels. In any case, if this advice seems invalid now, remember it for the map reset.


Hide your diamond in hidden furnaces as chests. Many people turn Furnaces 'Off' when they use x-ray hacks.


Learn to use potions. I don't care how good you are at PvP without them, real PvP in the wild they will change the game.


Carry a of bucket of water. Keep it on your bar at all times. It can save you if you get set on fire. It can slow down people chasing you if you drop it / hop it as you run. It can help you get off high cliffs. It can make cave exploring that much more easy.


Don't trust anyone. Yes, this is worth saying twice.


Build a secure area on a chunk of area as a base before you claim it. The moment you claim it, it's on the Dynamic Map. Yes, there -really are- people who sit there watching new factions and waiting to see if they claimed an area yet just to swoop in and kill them.


If you talk shit, we're all rooting for you to die. On the other hand, if you're a generally nice and polite person, we're sometimes likely to come help you as long as the person attacking you isn't an ally / isn't ALSO very nice and polite.
Even then, still don't trust your saviors. Trust no one.


No armor is sometimes better than iron armor. Iron armor means you're somewhat capable, and diamond players will treat you as such and kill you on sight. Iron won't really help you against diamond, and diamond players are a lot less likely to attack nude people because it doesn't give any kill credit and naked people rarely have anything worth taking.
Yes we know you came from reddit. We all came from reddit. But this server has history and if you don't know what 'Greysoul' is, who 'Lannister', rrowland, or camxd were, or what the Triforce was, then you don't understand the undercurrent of old politics that run back to the old days of the server and you should, again, not trust anyone because you never know who has a vendetta 



If you're really worried about someone hiding outside your base, log out and back in before you leave. It causes the chunk to reload and unless they re-crouch really quickly, shows them. An annoying glitch when you're raiding, but useful when you're the one being hunted.
Likewise, if you're running from someone / raiding a base, make sure to occasionally hit and hold shift again. As you enter new chunks that weren't formed when you hit shift, the chunks don't see you as shifted, just an unfortunate glitch in the game. A split second to re-crouch is hopefully less of a giveaway than having your name be obvious.


Lone Wolves


Lone Wolfing is hard. Everyone is out to get you. Factions will team up on you if they find you. Other Lone Wolves are dangerous. And x-ray mods WILL find your little base / hovel and your treasure chest, and steal what's in it.
Log out with your best stuff on you, including a decent amount of food, and if you have melons, a few seeds / melon slices necessary to restart your farm if it comes to that.


Make your base down at bedrock level. Keep it small. Light it with natural lava instead of glowstone or torches. This makes it a lot less obvious at a glance from an xray mod, and being so low keeps your name hidden from the occasional passer by.


Don't follow a straight line to make your base, IE, don't make it at 500, 1000 or something. Go for oddball numbers. Hide the entrance. I personally like to find a natural cave and learn it without placing torches. Most decent caves, especially if they branch off a whole bunch, will at least lead to y=12 and from there you can dig out your hovel. </TEXT>

If you quit giving these people like 8th chances than they will go away! The community will grow better if you shun the ones that make it shitty. Take my advice, it used to be that betraying was one of the worst things you could do to your rep so it only happened rarely. But now that it's almost commonplace, the community has gone to shit and the betrayers keep getting chances! Use the knowledge from the past to make a better future for HCF!

	<TEXT> Since Axis was my last hurrah and it just ended, I'm thinking it's time for me to go.

But first, here is my story.

MAP 2: Joined for like 5 minutes and thought I could h@ck the server. Couldn't, left.

MAP 3: Joined and led a noob faction called Amnesia with some random guy I met in spawn. Logged in during EOTW and died very fast

MAP 4: Wandered around, used the spawn cannon for the first time, and while admiring the spawn cannon got blown up by a creeper. Joined ShadowWalk for the first time. Thanks to Mrme I didn't quit the server here, he gave me a faction when nobody knew me. I had a lot of fun with my new friends and fought at my first EOTW with ShadowWalk and Baddies.


MAP 5: Joined ShadowWalk at the beginning of this map, played around and had the most fun I have ever had in a map, met the UHF guys, learned to never trust anyone after Toontasker betrayed us(I cri) got my first kill and fought at another EOTW and was the first of the hypno alliance to die.


MAP 6: Biggest/best base I have ever been part of building and fought with the legendary guys often, camping each other all the time.


MAP 7: Led my first major faction Apocalypse, and when that failed I joined Tyrants with Shotzvee, like nobody was on at one point so I took a tour around the entire map and jumped everyone's bases.

MAP 8: joined hcfuni, didn't do much this map. Also played for TowerTech


MAP 9: Was inactive for the first week or so and then I joined ThirdLaw with TravisArmstrong, Shotz, Torremth, and pkeffect. I then left and played in a fac with a friend.


MAP 10: Played with my friend and was the first one in full diamond. Not much else happened this map for me.


MAP 10.5: Officer'd Accido/ ShadowWalk and then joined Freeshot, then when that failed joined 8BALL


MAP 12: Played as my first trading faction: TastyCake with Porkchop, then left for the pvping fac Lucky7... We kinda sucked lol.


MAP 13: Battletoads! Had a lot of fun with my boys from Battletoads, even though we died a lot.


MAP 14: First Watcher map, didn't do much. Fast abuses, gets the big ban.


MAP 15: Another watcher map, began to learn to code, starting to get tired of the monotonous watcher life.


MAP 16: More watcher, starting to get really bored, decide to have a little more fun with it, /warned Highlife for icanhazfacrip. He then came into mumble and got me in trouble.


MAP 17: Got demoted :c then joined CookieClan and officered them. Pretty inactive this map.

MAP 18: Played with quarts and created the failed Arena, joined DuckClan and went to palace and died and left the faction. Then joined Frontlines, which promptly died.

MAP 19: Axis, 30 man roster, big potential... But ultimately failed because people are idiots. 

This was my last hurrah, and this is most likely the end of Chaseair115 for the time being. I may stop by from time-to-time. And will continue to lurk the subreddit.


MENTIONS:


Mrme17k: for giving me my first faction.



Gtwillwin: for being one of my oldest friends on the server.



Motown: you sexy fox



Soccrboy: sorry for killing you with the pig ride.



Pikaoku: pretty chill guy, glad I met you in ShadowWalk.



TheXyrin: for being one of my good friends back in the old days.



Spazsquirrel: OG squeaks!




Stabbdnthetumy: For being our beloved leader and good friend. 



Cmak: one of the nicest guys I know, gl with admin.



Joe: best noob killer N/A.



Shotzvee: For giving me a chance a few times.



Malen: Pumpkin Farm OP



Daesium: Bowls =/= Iron sword


Virgoth: sexy ass fire fighter


If I've forgotten anyone tell me in the comments.


Thanks for the memories HCF.

**Other Things About Me:** I enjoy being a chill guy, I don't trash talk often, but when i do its normally good natured banter and never toxic. I have never betrayed and have ALOT of experience with EOTW and fighting... being on HCF for over 16 maps and participating in every EOTW. But what i have yet to do is win one. That is what I want to do this map.. Is to finally get the EOTW win that I have been looking for since I joined Map 3. If someone from a large faction could give me a shot I would be very, very, grateful. 

Thanks,

Chase </TEXT>

PvP: 6/10 in 1v1s but I really enjoy leading team fights and probably an 8/10 in those.

Communication: Teamspeak3, Dolby, Mumble

Something about myself: I've Lead/ officered factions before so I know what I am doing in factions and in team fights and by leading faction mates around. I do not trash talk and I feel that I can work with anybody!

	<TEXT> Sorry, whatever the reason may be, I probably wasn't thinking right (LordEthano), and I may have been trolling you (EagleBagel), or I may have just been an overall jerk to you(anybody else). HCF has been one of the best things that I have ever been a part of and I really enjoy the community and every aspect of the server. I think that right now, we should all just cut the shit talking, the doxxing, the calling-someone-out-on-irl-problems(seriously, that's fucked up) and seriously, stop shitting on the admins. They try their fucking hardest to please everybody, and let's be honest, we're a pretty hard community to please. Can we not just give each other the same respect that you would give someone who was playing against you in a sport? We, as people who share a common interest(HCF, Minecraft, league, etc.) all have at least something in common. Just show some respect to your opponents. Trash talk is alright in moderation. Y'all just need to chill out and show some respect.

Here's mine: 

Map 8(I think): I get invited to some random faction that is lead by some guy named S13G3_WAR . So I join the faction, derp around a bit, get full iron and an iron sword and wait for the other full iron guy in the faction to log off... Leaving the leader(EagleBagel/Daesium/S13GE_whatever) totally helpless. I msg Braandenjames saying something about how I'm going to have to repent for my sins after this betrayal. I leave the faction and start hitting this naked guy in the base, when I realize something, he can hit me, but I can't hit him. He kills me with a fucking bowl and I didn't even scratch him. Still hear about that to this day. S/O EagleBagel.

TL;DR: Betrayed a noob faction, got killed by a naked guy with a bowl. </TEXT>
