	<TEXT> Hey everyone not sure if this is the right place to post, if not,maybe someone can move it to the right subreddit. Thanks alot.  So this story goes like this, i work in a restraunt right beside Niagara Falls, the bulding is right on the brink. Basically every time we go on a smoke break at 630 there is this light that appears for a bit then vanishes, its always there at the same time so we try to take our breaks around that time.( will include pictures). Does anyone know what this lighthole might be.

No this is not the moon, but maybe we are seeing a glimpse of mars? </TEXT>
