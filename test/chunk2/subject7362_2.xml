	<TEXT> She may be on the bridge to keep an eye on the captain and crew during important or tense moments - battle, first contacts, negotiations, for example. Not exactly that she'd be policing them and making sure everything is on the up and up (which she could obviously do), but moreso that by personally witnessing the most stressful events happening to the ship's command personnel she could provide improved counselling services afterwards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We see a fair bit of 24th Century sport culture throughout the franchise, and it appears to be an interesting combination of 20th/21st Century sports, new sports that have not been invented yet, and alien sports. We see that a lot of traditional Earth sports have died out (Sisko's baseball) or have been altered radically by technology (Bashir's and O'Brien's raquetball). We know that downhill skiing, horseback riding, and kayaking were enjoyed on the holodeck of the Enterprise, but we're not given even a glimpse of what they're like in the 24th Century. There are new martial arts that make make novel use of technology (ambojitsu) as well as widespread adoption of alien martial arts like Klingon calisthenics. We never actually see paresses squares in action but we do know that it is fast-paced, physical, and dangerous. We know that people enjoy mountaineering, spelunking and other outdoor extreme sports. Most characters are amateur athletes in some sort of competitive sport, but we also know there are professional leagues for football (soccer) at least, and perhaps other sports as well. Many people, Starfleet personnel and civilians alike, enjoy competitive shooting.
I would say that 24th Century sport culture is pretty well defined in the Star Trek universe, especially in two important points. First, it has adopted advanced technology while eschewing traditionalism. And second, risky or outright dangerous sports seem to be in vogue, which makes a lot of sense in a world where the frailness of the human body can be easily rectified through advanced medicine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think many pro athletes get much time off except during the off-season. MLB's season goes from April to October except for 8 teams who make the playoffs. Even a team that makes it to the world series basically gets 5 months of off-season.
The NHL regular season is about the same length, but twice as many teams make the playoffs and the playoffs last about 50% longer. A team that makes it to the Stanley Cup Finals only gets about 3.5 months for an off-season. The average NHL player plays a much longer season than the average MLB player, and it is without a doubt a much more physically punishing game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Newfoundland - Habs and Leafs seem to have about equal support though it can vary a little through time. From 1991 to 2005 St. John's was the home of Toronto's farm team the St. John's Maple leafs. I think the big leafs enjoyed a surge of popularity because of the baby leafs during that period. This also coincided with a period of relative competitiveness for the Toronto team, which obviously helped their popularity. Now Montreal's farm team plays in St. John's as the St. John's Ice Caps and it's become more common to see Montreal merch around town.
After the Habs and Leafs the next most popular team is definitely the Bruins. Newfoundland has a long history of contact with New England, and local malcontents who hate both Leafs and Habs usually gravitate towards the Bruins.
There is also a decently strong fanbase of Oilers fans in the very specific demographic that grew up during the dynasty years, and there are some older Red Wings fans who go all the way back to the Howe era.
And of course there are people who cheer for the hometown boys no matter where they are. The Red Wings gained a lot of fans because of Danny Cleary and the Bruins as well because of Michael Ryder. Teddy Purcell never seemed to catch on like Cleary and Ryder did, even though he's had a great career, perhaps because he's moved around a fair bit, but also perhaps because he's usually playing in some far off exotic location like LA or Tampa Bay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a more fundamental question is "What is a stardate?". The word date implies a calendar which in turn implies a complex time keeping system based probably on an astronomical event. Conceivably the entire Federation could use the Earth's orbital period as its basis for a calendar, but perhaps there is some other astronomical event it could be based on. In either case it seems unlikely that a decimal time system could be worked out that is faithful to the human idea of a year and to human physiological needs.
The other alternative is that stardates are actually units of time - decimal representations of how much time has passed during each revolution of the earth about the sun. As such stardates wouldn't necessarily have that much meaning in regular life - they wouldn't govern when you'd get up in the morning (whatever that means on a starship) for instance, but they would be a convenient means of objective time throughout the federation.
These two imperfect alternatives have always seemed to me to be in conflict with each other, so i've always thought of star dates as breaking the fourth wall to provide out-of-universe information to the viewer. Just a bit of information to satisfy the hardcore trekkie, while being inoffensive to the casual viewer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure I read somewhere, but couldn't find the exact number when i googled just now, that most of the energy liberated through matter/antimatter annihilation is unrecoverable because it escapes in the form of neutrinos. Something like 35% is the maximum possible efficiency. Still, I'll admit that the factor is more than 10x - probably more like 50x. Although if we're willing to talk warp cores and cold fusion it's not hard to imagine that Star Fleet has some sort of futuristic Neutrino Capture Technology that makes the process a whole lot more efficient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe it's a matter of power density. Maybe a M/AM reactor is 10x more powerful than a fusion reactor, but on a station, where size and maneuverability are not even remotely an issue, it makes sense to have 10 fusion reactors instead of one M/AM reactor. Maybe it's more economical that way. Another bonus is that there's no chance of a warp core breach (which seems to happen all the time on starships, whereas I've never heard of a nuclear meltdown in star trek). And it'd probably be really convenient to have the redundancy of 10 reactors rather than one which could cripple the station if it went out of service. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most provincial flags are terrible. At least Newfoundland's flag is an attempt at some kind of composition and symbolism, even if it is facile and populist from a design perspective. For me, the thing this flag has going for it is its reference to color field painting, an obviously deliberate choice considering it was designed by Christopher Pratt, a prominent Newfoundland painter (even though he was not a color field painter himself). I like it, but I am an artist, ymmv. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't recall any specific mention of how quickly a vessel accelerates when the impulse engines are operating at full power, but it is certainly made to seem like the Enterprise D can accelerate to near light speed in a matter of seconds. Therefore I don't think mass is much of a limiting factor in vessel and engine design - ships can be made large and comfortable as far as impulse power and classical physics are involved.

A different size limitation might be due to the size, shape and efficiency of the warp field. I'd imagine that over the years as warp technology matured the usable space within a warp field would get bigger, thus allowing larger ships to be built. At the same time warp technology would likely be getting more efficient, meaning that warp engines and the machinery/personnel to operate them would be getting proportionally smaller. The internal design and space utilization of vessels like Enterprise D and Voyager represent the intersection between warp field size and warp field efficiency in the mid 24th Century. </TEXT>
