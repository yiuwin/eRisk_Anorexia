	<TEXT> I have a BA in English and am currently going for my master's in Special Education. Right now I am doing freelance writing from home to help pay the bills. My boyfriend works full time and I have a daughter (from a previous relationship) so I feel a strong need to provide money in my current living situation (even though my bf is happy to pay for everything while I go to school). 

I wrote a bubble-gum romance novel (nothing special. Typical crap I could send to a publisher for some easy money) and I got it picked up as a ghost-writing book. This means my name doesn't even go on it. They pay me chump-change and put it under another name. Fine. That's exactly what I wrote it for. Still, I posted about it on my facebook because it was my first novel and I was happy to just have finished a book. 

Got a call today for an old "friend" roaring drunk, who proceeded to berate me for 15 min before I hung up on him.  "You think you're better than me?! You're not a real writer! You sold out. Oh just because you're "published" now you think you're hot shit? HUH?? I'm a REAL writer. Be real with me! You're not a real writer. You suck and you know it and I know it. Don't get mad because I'm being honest with you! I have REAL talent!" Even though I was completely honest about what I wrote and the sort of "accept anyone" publisher I found. 

I swear, people will shit on anything, won't they? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YES. "I can't afford it" at my house means something totally different than the average person. I've actually been out to eat with people and when they say "How about the spaghetti?" and I say "I can't afford it" I will see them reach for their purse and I realize that they misunderstand. My boyfriend and I both count calories so sometimes I forget who I'm talking to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any situation that wastes huge chunks of my time for no good reason and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm so busy that time is often my most precious commodity. 

Example: My therapist is across town and parking is terrible so I have to leave an hour before my appointment, park far away, walk 15 min from where I parked and then do it all over again in reverse when I am leaving. Fine. Still, his receptionist told me my appointment was at 9am (as always), yet two weeks ago when I got there, she told me I was wrong and my appointment was at 1 pm, so I had to do all that... twice. 

Good news, had plenty of time to scream it out in the car on the way home.  </TEXT>

Instead of taking room temperature eggs that had been sitting out for an hour (to make sure they are room temperature) I beat the eggs for an entire hour. I was using a hand mixer so it was exhausting. Felt like an idiot after.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a recovered bulimic. 

At the height of my illness I was purging 15-20 times a day. I went into the ER regularly with intense chest pain. The first time I experienced it I thought I was having a heart attack. It hurt so bad I would clench my teeth until they felt like they would shatter and it would leave a sweat print in the shape of my body after the episodes would end. 

It happened maybe once or twice a month and quickly escalated to several a week. Every time I went to the ER they said it was heartburn and sent me home. The last time I went in, they sent me home and I had an even worse attack a few hours later and went back to the ER. Some doctor finally got a wild hair up his ass and decided to do an ultrasound. 

Turns out I had been passing gallstones (developed due to my extreme rapid weight loss)  and one of them was so big it impacted and I was going septic. They did emergency surgery. Only after I was stable was I made aware of how close I had been to dying.  </TEXT>

I was totally down. 

I couldn't have a dog where I was staying so I told him I would go by and walk the dog once a day and feed him twice a day, let him out to potty ect. I ended up cleaning his apartment (much like OP described, not like a complete overhaul) and when he got home, he was so happy and grateful.

	<TEXT> We moved in together. First mistake. She was the biggest slob on the planet. Never cleaned once. Then she got a dog that wasn't house trained and was too lazy to get off her ass and let him out so the dog ruined the carpet. The whole place stunk. I had a 2 year old kid at the time and had multiple talks with the roommate about how I can't raise a kid in this disgusting environment. Finally she told me to just move out. I payed her a full month's rent for next month when moving out as well as the fee for breaking the lease early. (Our relationship was still amicable, though strained at this point.)


The new place I moved into had a malfunctioning water heater and (to make a long story short) a week after I moved in my kid got badly burned by the water heater. While in the hospital with my kid I called my friend and cried because I needed someone to talk to. After I hung up with her, she called CPS on me and told them that my kid was abused and should be taken from me. Mutual friends of ours confirmed that she was bragging she had done it at work the next day.


CPS temporarily took my kid away and put her in foster care. My child and I had to go through extensive psychological and intelligence tests as well as parenting classes and therapy. They concluded that the charges were unfounded and finally returned custody of my kid back to me. It took 7 months.
Fuck her.


EDIT: There is a lot more to the story (thus saying "to make a long story short") but that was the gist of what she specifically did to me. </TEXT>

Now I can't decide if it's never lasted over 10 days in my house or it doesn't expire as fast as it says, but either way, that's very good to know!

Man, I figured the resealable ones were like milk where the date was when it expired regardless. I knew the non-refrigerated ones were different, but it says 7-10 days right next to the expiration date on that container. The more you know!  </TEXT>

1 Large white onion

1/2 cup flour

1 1/2 cup Silk unsweetened original almond milk

Salt and pepper to taste. 


Take two logs of Jenny o' Breakfast sausage and put them in a very large skillet or regular sized pot. Cook with diced white onion until sausage and onion are thoroughly cooked. Add 1/2 cup flour and stir until flower is completely absorbed. Add 1 1/2 cups almond milk, 1/2 a cup at a time, until gravy reaches desired consistency. Salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for 10-15 min. 

If you use the measurements and exact products I mentioned, 1/2 a cup of this gravy is 140 calories. I pour it over a toasted slice of Nature's Own 100% Whole Wheat Toast (60 calories) and the whole thing comes out to 200 calories for a high protein stick-to-your-ribs southern breakfast.

(Alright so it looks gross but it's REALLY good)

	<TEXT> I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and I was doing some research online and it was saying it was caused by higher than normal androgen levels. Does this mean I have an advantage with lifting over females without high androgen levels? 

Wikipedia says: "Androgens are also the original anabolic steroids and the precursor of all estrogens. The primary and most well-known androgen is testosterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstenedione are less known generally, but are of equal importance in male development."

I realize most of the calories are estimations. (I mean, it's not like they measure the mayo before they squirt it on the burger. I get it.) I can even maybe, *maybe* understand why mom and pop shops don't have nutritional information available. Some of them don't even have web-pages. 

Still, when you start to have more than one or two locations and I can't find an official spreadsheet from you, after going through three pages on google, then we have a problem. The place I am going to with my friends Wednesday night has 22 locations and I can't find anything and it's just frustrating.

I know for a fact this place is most likely REALLY bad (It's greasy Mexican food, my favorite) so it makes me think they don't put it up because of that. Still, if it's so bad you have to hide it, I'm just going to assume it's so bad that I can't eat there. I'm still going, I'm just mad.

Most of you know my story, but just briefly, I owe it all to calorie counting and a little bit to exercise, but honestly 90%  to calorie counting. I think even my face has gotten slimmer over the past year, though no extra weight has been lost, simply due to dropping my BF% through powerlifting. 

People who have not seen me in a long time don't recognize me. My best friend's sister got married recently and I went to help my friend (her sister) decorate the wedding cake and the bride showed up halfway through. I ran up to her and hugged her because I had not seen her in years and she freaked out for a second before my friend had to be like "It's Halfwaythere!" 

Shucks guys! Thanks for the gold whoever did that.  </TEXT>

So some people are upset about Sia's music video Elastic Heart, claiming the interaction between Shia LaBeouf and Maddie Ziegler was inappropriate and triggering to sexual abuse victims. I actually enjoyed this video as well as the video from the last time Sia and Ziegler worked together. I couldn't help but think about how if Shia were replaced with a woman, this would be a nonissue. I was curious what you guy's opinions were of the video, the reactions and, the general attitude as a whole in the USA toward man/girl interactions.

	<TEXT> Up until six months ago, I was pretty much a "Throw a box of cake into the mixer" sort of "baker". My daughter's 5th birthday rolled around and for some reason I really wanted to make her a rainbow cake. Well it got out of control (for me) and i worked on it for like 3 days. The day before her birthday the dog got the cake and I had to start over. After all that I just kept baking for some weird reason. Every birthday that came along in my small group of friends, I would make a cake (most times for their kids.) I have almost no training and I tend to just rip off of things I see online or take quick instruction videos from youtube. They are nowhere close to professional, but I am proud of about 75% of them. It's been fun so far. Here they are in no particular order.

"Oh my god! Congratulations!!"

It made me laugh. I still think it's funny. Don't get me wrong I used to be fat and I'm glad I'm not anymore, but all the ED baggage and ordeal, yeesh, it was horrific and not worth it.

If I turn down an extra slice of pizza, don't worry.

If I suggest we go to a healthier restaurant, don't worry.

If I decline going out to eat because "there's nothing there I feel comfortable eating" don't worry. 

If I tell you about how I'm trying to eat more vegetables and fruits, don't worry. 

BUT

If I eat four slices of pizza

If I finish my french fries AND yours,

If I grab a handful of your food without asking what it is

If I eat cheeseburgers and movie popcorn with you all day. 

Then. Then worry. Then ask.  That is when I'm closest to breaking. 


In a world where over-eating is the norm, red flags never seem to go up with my (wonderful, wonderful) friends, unless I'm turning down food. Turning down food is not my problem. Being on a strict (but very healthy) diet is not my problem. My problem is when I lose control and feel like purging is my only option. 

Rest your minds that I have not relapsed in almost five years. I love my friends to death. They are my greatest support structure and I know they only ask because they love me. It's just a bit strange to me that I always get asked when I'm turning down food.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have phenomenal social skills and I love being around people. Still, I'm only 26 but it seems as I age, the idea of going out and doing things has lost it's charm. I have a 5 year old daughter and am with the love of my life, and have about 5 really good friends, all of whom I see maybe once every two months. (different ones at different times, not all together. Not all of them know each other.) 

I also keep in touch with about 15 less-close friends over facebook, but maybe only see some of them once a year. About 6-7 of them have moved away and I haven't seen them in years, but I maintain pretty regular chat-conversations with them over facebook.  

My point is, I remember when I was little, seeing my mom had maybe 2-3 friends and thinking how sad it was. Now It doesn't seem sad at all. I'm not even really upset at the friends I have let fade away, and I don't feel bad when I don't see them in a long time. I'd much rather cook dinner for my family and cuddle up with my boyfriend and a beer to watch netflix on a Friday night than go out. I get plenty of interaction with other people at work and school. I've noticed also, that when people at school or work will suggest hanging out, I'll resist making plans. I've met people I totally get along famously with, and still, when friendship is approached, I feel like "Eh, I don't need any more friends. Too much work. I'm good." 

One of my oldest and (I thought) dearest friends is extremely clingy. Yesterday she un-friended me on facebook and told me not to contact her again because "I love you and value you as a person and have enjoyed being friends with you for over 10 years, but I really don't see the point of this if you won't make an effort to see me more than twice a month." She lives 45 min away from me, has never made the effort to come to me (I'm always the one driving) and she is single with no kids and no job, just college,  while I have a kid and a job and am in full time graduate school. What was most shocking to me though, was how little I cared about her "breaking up" with me. I was just like "Well, alright then." and I think she was pretty floored by my reaction, but I seriously could not muster a shit to give. I think what REALLY bothered me was how much it didn't bother me. 

Is all this normal?

EDIT: My boyfriend is in the army, and when he has to leave for certain periods of time (usually it's around 3-5 weeks) I miss him HORRENDOUSLY, so it's not like I'm incapable of attachment.   </TEXT>

These pictures were taken just a few weeks shy of a year apart. One was right before I started lifting and I took the 2nd ones this morning. (Darker hair is the new, lighter is the old). I am 5'6" and 140 lbs in both pictures. 

I realized after I took it, that my stance in the 2nd pic is a bit wider, so I'm not sure how much that is manipulating the results, but I do remember that I was flexing and sucking it in in both (before and after) pictures. I think most of you starting out will have more luck than I have at getting rid of the front pooch, because mine is pretty much all skin from losing a large ammount of weight previously. 

I think I would have picked a better outfit had I planned this, but I was just going through my timeline on facebook last night and saw this pic from almost exactly a year ago and decided to do a side-by-side. 

EDIT:I'm actually more surprised by the change in my jaw line. 

EDIT: Ok, details. So I started a few weeks short of a year ago. I origionally started on a three day split on a five day cycle. I was doing standard weight-lifting practices (3X12 with 30-25 second rests in between, which later went up to 4X12). I upped the weight as soon as I could manage it. The next 3 months I did compound sets where I would work one muscle group (4X15) like chest or something, and then immediately go into a different exercise (4X15) for, let's say, triceps, before I rested for 30 seconds. Once again, as I was able I added more weight. The next 3 months I did Ashley Conrad's clutch cut from bodybuilding.com which you can find if you plug it into google. It's a form of circuit training. I did that for about 2 weeks short of 3 months, and then rested for two weeks. The plan is only for 3 weeks, but i just did it over and over again. During this time I was lifting very light, but with more explosive and cardiovascular type lifting practices. This last 3 months I've returned to basics (4X12-15 depending on what I can manage when I up the weight) with 30 second rests in between sets. In focusing on lifting as heavy as I possibly can right now because I am trying to get my lifts much heavier. 

As for cardio, just your topical 60 min of whatever form of cardio I can stand at the moment. Jogging, cycling, elliptical ect. I also walk my dogs for about 40 min every morning. As for eating, I try and eat around 1500 calories a day and just try and hit 90-100g of protein. I somtimes end up at about 1,750-2,000 calories, depending on how my day went. On the weekends my diet often goes out the window, and though I don't go crazy, I know I eat enough (combined with not exercising on the weekend) that I have not lost any weight in 18 months. I want to be 130 lbs, but thus far, have not done what it takes to lose the last 10 lbs </TEXT>

Today is my cake day and I thought I would reflect on what made me create this account in the first place, two years ago. I had reached my halfway point in my weight-loss journey, back when my goal weight was 150 lbs. 

Here is a picture of me at my highest weight. I was 9 months pregnant (though you would never be able to tell) with my daughter. I don't know what my weight was at. I wouldn't let the doctor tell me anymore, but I'd guess I was at or close to around 300 lbs, at 5'5  http://imgur.com/rq7bacF

3 months after I gave birth to my daughter I weighed in at 270 lbs. Here is the picture someone took of me that made me realize I had to get my shit together. http://imgur.com/MicopmA

I'll go into it more if people are curious (though I didn't want to focus on it too much with the initial post) but I lost 110 lbs through mild cardio and calorie counting, and somewhere along the way developed bulimia and had to be hospitalized and almost died.  http://imgur.com/nq3eWdk 
When I got out of the hospital I was too afraid to diet and exercise. I was the only parent my daughter had, and I was afraid she would become an orphan. So instead of dieting or just being normal and healthy, I went back to my over-eating ways and a year later, this was me all over again. 

http://imgur.com/AK9Muz1

So after a year being recovered, I worked with my therapist and doctors and started losing weight again. This time the right way. The first 60 lbs I lost was just through calorie counting (this as when I made my reddit account). Then I did 20-30 min of cardio 2-4 times a week, mostly walking. Then I started swimming. Then biking. Then running. I was vegetarian for a while. Then vegan. Then I did Keto a little, then I did maybe 5-6 other things I can't remember anymore. All the while I always counted calories. These days I pretty much just count calories and try and get around 100 g of protein a day and thats pretty much it. I started lifting weights a little over nine months ago, and this is my progress from month 0-6 (though the before picture is from a year before I started lifting) http://imgur.com/raEKCSb and here is a picture taken of me at 9 months of lifting (though I don't see much of a difference between 6 and 9 months, even though my strength has gone up.) http://imgur.com/rhxwSzR

My one rep max lifts are

Bench  110 lbs
Dead-Lift  190 lbs
Squat  200 lbs (at parallel) 

WARNING: If loose skin grosses you out, you might not want to click on the next two links

Here is an album of my muscles from 6 months of weight lifting. http://imgur.com/a/PA063 I also documented my loose skin retraction on my midsection (just because SO MANY people had questions about it and there is hardly any information out there) http://imgur.com/F4TpOpf 

I have not lost weight in over 18 months, but have gone from a size 8 to a size 4 due to the strength training. I am currently at 138 lbs at 5'6. Guess what? I GREW AN INCH. My doctor told me that he often sees people get taller as they lose large amounts of weight because their spine becomes less compressed. Crazy right? My shoe size also went down. 

I still eventually want to hit my new goal weight of 130, but obviously I'm in no hurry to get there. I have a really bad shoulder that I have dislocated dozens of times and am now looking to get surgery to fix it, and the doc says I might not be able to lift for 6 months because of it. This is something I have cried about multiple times in the past 2 weeks. 

Anyway, that's me in all my raw glory. I'm proud of myself. Excited to see where I am next cake-day. Here's some random extra pictures.

	<TEXT> Look, I get it. It's hard t lose over 130 lbs without people noticing. It's hard to keep it to yourself and not tell anyone when you are literally half your previous body weight. I appreciate all the support and encouragement I've gotten over the years. These last 2.5 years has seen me change from a couch potato who could barely make it up the stairs, to someone that I finally call "athlete" and all the encouragement and accolades mean so much to me. 

Still, this does not give you a right to make comments constantly to me about my body. As if I was not always thinking about my body constantly enough as it is, trying to wade through these new waters of my mind's eye and trying to feel out how I look. Telling me I'm too skinny is not appreciated, especially when the two girls I work with are standing on either side of me, both easily 20 lbs lighter than I am.  You never tell them they are too skinny. Is it because they were never fat? Can we pretend I was never fat since it's none of your god damn business anyway? I appreciate your concern, and your opinion, but really? Do you need to tell me every god damn day I'm too skinny?  What are you going to say when I lose the next ten pounds I'm planning to drop? And what about the other guy who tells me I'm too muscular. So I'm too skinny or too muscular. Which is it?  Or is it the obese guy at the gym who tells me I need to lose more weight? Guess I'm not going to make anyone happy but myself, so if you could just shut the fuck up, you and everyone else, that would be great. Your opinions don't matter.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be really really big and lost a bunch of weight, and in the process discovered weightlifting. The first time I discovered it, I was deep in the throws of bulimia and it actually helped aid in my recovery because if I kept hurting my body, it was hurting my lifting. Then I dislocated my shoulder and gained back 95 lbs of the weight I lost. 

Now I'm 26, slimmer than i've ever been (and healthy to boot!) and started lifting again a year ago. Once again, even though I have not relapsed in over our years, weightlifting is great for my recovery. I also have a hectic life with lost of stress. Lifting is my hobby. Lifting keeps me grounded. Keeps me healthy. Helps me blow off steam. I've made some amazing progress over the past year and I can't even begin to tell people how proud I am of myself. 

Friday I dislocated my shoulder... again... BAD. Went to the doctor and I need surgery. I'll be off weights for 6 months. Everyone is great and sympathetic, but I keep randomly bursting into tears and even my boyfriend doesn't seem to completely understand. I don't think this will make me relapse. I know I'll be back at it and better than before a year from now. Still, I'm SO MAD, and just horribly sad... and it's been over three days and I can't stop crying and people are starting to get annoyed... I think. I assume they are. God knows I'm annoyed with myself over it. I just wish I knew *one* person who fully grasped how devastating this is for me.   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-10-08 20:04:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys. I'm not sure how many of you would be interested in knowing this, but I figured I would bring it up since I saw a similar phenomena being discussed on here a few months back. 


I can't remember exactly what the context was, but a few of you mentioned that when you were cutting, you felt a certain level of restless energy and that some of you had trouble sleeping during a cut, and had a lot more energy. From what I understand, this is atypical for most people, but the idea stuck in my head because I also felt like I had a lot more energy and anxiety during a caloric deficit. 


I'm a recovered bulimic and have always been very interested in eating disorders. I try and keep up with new findings and articles, and have recently begun reading about anorexia. I found that one of the lesser known, but major signs of anorexic-like mentalities, are becoming more active and restless when in a caloric deficit. Many anorexics suffer from RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome), which I found quite surprising because I have been irritated by RLS for years. I also have bouts of insomnia that I have recently noticed are matching up with when I'm in a caloric deficit. 


A few people have theorized that anorexia survived in the hunter-gatherer era because at times, it was beneficial to have people in your group that would become more energized during starvation, rather than lethargic like the majority of the population. These individuals, they believed, might have played a key role of hunting down and finding food for the group during intense times of starvation. In that case, anorexia might have been a good thing to have. 


Obviously if any of you are experiencing this, that doesn't mean you have anorexia. I just figured it was something to keep an eye on and be aware of. I already know my mind leans towards strange ways of thinking about food, but sometimes an ED can sneak up on the people you least expect. The rising number of men with anorexia shows that they are also not immune to this deadly and insidious disease. Stay healthy people! </TEXT>

So let me back up. I'm really new at this so bare with me. If I'm doing my eyeshadow, and I'm using 3 different colors, once I have applied one color to both eyes and I'm switching, do i need another brush? Do I wash off the brush in between colors? (I'd imagine not since a wet brush seems like a bad idea). Do you rub it on a paper towel? Do you have multiples of each? Do you use the same brush for your powder foundation as your liquid? (I don't, but should I?) 

When blending, do you start at the light color and work out? Dark to light? Do you clean the brush off before you start the other eye so you don't get the dark bits from the previous eye in the light bits of the second eye? 

Yes, I'm serious, please don't laugh.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tale from Planet Fitness </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-04 00:01:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So as many of you know, I found myself in possession of a Planet Fitness membership, as I spoke about here: http://www.reddit.com/r/swoleacceptance/comments/2go0p0/broki_took_my_boyfriend/

I decided after much deliberation, that I would go and try and make the best of it. Be a missionary of Broden, if it were, to those lacking in the swoll, in the land of broki. 

Yesterday was the holiest of all days, leg day, and I was almost all the way through my "buns for Broden" routine. I had already done my lunges, squats and calf raises and was on the stretching mats doing my hip thrusters, donkey kicks and dirty-dogs.  Towards the end of my last set, I was approached by a Pagan Planet Fitness Priestess and informed that my routine was making some of the other ladies uncomfortable. Instead of proclaiming my love for Broden, I packed up and finished at home. I fear I am not doing well there, brothers and sisters of swoll. I vowed I would set off the lunk-alarm on my first week, and sort-of did, only because I had a coughing and choking fit when my protein went down the wrong tube.  I find myself weakened in this dark and purple place. Broden forgive me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, I just wanted to say that I know progress is very hard to tell when a person is wearing clothes. I wish I had taken more underwear pics before I started, but seeing as I have so much excess skin, I doubt I would have been brave enough to post them anyway. 

So I've been seeing great progress from month 1-6. I take progress shots every 3 months. For the first time, when I put up my 9 month progress, I was disappointed. My butt looks like it has regressed back to month 3. As my body fat continues to drop, my chest is getting slightly smaller, which I guess I am ok with, but now that I've noticed the butt is getting smaller too, I'm a bit worried?

does the 9 month picture look more fit? Less? Relatively the same? I've continued to put weight onto my lifts, and change my program a little every 3 months to keep it challenging and interesting.  I guess this is just the first month I have been a bit let down. I know i'm just asking you guys to speculate, but I figure I could use a set of eyes other than my own.

	<TEXT> I'm sure many of you are familiar with that worthless feeling on rest days, where you *know* you should rest (and you do) but really want to go run or lift or what-have-you. 

If you go a day or two without exercise and then go for a run, or lift something really heavy, do you get that sort of sense of... i dunno, release? like stretching after a long sleep? It's like scratching an itch inside your muscles? I brought this up with my boyfriend and he looked at me like I was insane.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Activity level and body fat percentage in reference to my period. I have questions. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-01 21:50:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I want to start off by saying, I am not looking for medical advice or any sort of diagnosis. I'm just asking Is it possible. 


So I started exercising regularly about a year ago. A year before that I had dropped 132 lbs. I started weightlifting nine months ago, and about 2.5-3 months ago, I started doing circuit training, which has brought my exercise to a whole new and intense level I never thought I would be capable of before. I love it.


Six months ago I got off my birth control pills that I had been taking for 5 years. About 6-7 weeks after that I got my period. Then I got my period again about 5-5.5 weeks after that. I was expecting it to be a bit slow out of the gate, because coming off BC pills will do that. However, I am now about 2.5 months late for my next period. I figured it would get more regular over time, not less. 

I am 26 years old, 5'6 and 140 lbs at about 20% body fat. I know most women don't lose their period until their body fat is much lower than that, but I also know that for every woman it's a little different. Is it possible my period lateness would have anything to do with my increased exercise? Or is that silly to ask that at 20% body fat? Do some women lose their period at 20% body fat? Or if it was due to the exercise, would it most likely come back as my body adjusts to the increased activity level? I already have a Dr's appointment, but it's 6 weeks out and I'm just curious. There is no way I'm pregnant. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm coming to you guys rather than r/loseit because many of them seem way more interested in calories than macros, and you all seem to be a lot more knowledgeable when it comes to the diet of a lifter. 

My boyfriend is in the army and has been lifting for years. He is extremely strong, but his body fat percentage is far too high and the Army (rightly so) has him on a schedule to lose weight. Over the past 3 months I've been cooking, packing and portioning out all his meals with all the correct macros and calories he needs, because he can't cook for shit. He has lost 30 lbs and has about 20-30 left to go. 

They problem is that he is going to be out in the field for the next 4 weeks, and every time he goes out there, it is all he can do to just not gain weight. MREs are total dogshit for cutting. This time he is going out there with canned fruits and veggies, but I was wondering if you all had any other ideas for food he could take that doesn't need to be refrigerated or cooked. He has nuts and stuff too, and I think I could send him out with some tuna and beef jerky, but I know he isn't too keen on Jerky because the sodium is so high. 

I always wondered if there were survivalist companies out there that possibly sold healthy versions of MREs or some other sort of self-cooking food that was not terrible for you. Any and all ideas are appreciated. Thanks in advance.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-09-19 03:50:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For those of you who don't know who Ken Ham is, he is responsible for the "Answers in Genesis" campaign. He created many of the textbooks that you guys post pictures and quotes from, claiming the Earth is 5,000 years old, as well as copious other pseudo-science statements.

He was touring, giving creationism seminars, and I went to one with my parents when I was ten. Back then we all were *very* staunch in our "faith". 

During one part of the seminar, Ken Ham said (none of this is verbatim) "Evolutionists claim that proof of evolution exists, because we have redundant body parts that no longer serve a purpose. I'm here to tell you that is wrong. Every part of your body was created by god, and they all serve a purpose. If you really think evolution is true, I will pay for you to have surgery to get a "redundant" body part removed. Then you will see how useful it is! So far nobody has taken me up on my offer, which just goes to show that nobody really believes in evolution." 

Someone must have raised their hand in the back, because Ken called on him and the guy said something along the lines of: "Are you saying you will pay for me to get my wisdom teeth removed? Money is tight and I need to have them taken out." 

Ken Ham replied something along the lines of "Haha, good one, next question? Only serious questions please!" 

This memory just popped into my head today and made me laugh.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sooo, I made "high" protein, "low" carb low calorie cupcakes that taste like magic... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-14 00:03:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let me start off by saying, if this is the wrong place for these, I am so sorry. I love lifting, and one of the things that even comes close to my love of lifting is my love of baking. I've been trying to develop a "lesser of two evils" cupcake recipe for a while that was as low calorie as possible, and as high protein as possible, while being low(ish) carb and NOT taste like "diet food" (aka, where you can't taste artificial sweetener or the protein powder after-taste)

It's a chocolate cupcake with strawberry jam filling and chocolate/coffee whipped topping.

Anyway, here is the recipe. For those of you who are anti-artificial sweetener (stevia), this might not be for you, but if your only objection is the taste, I would still give this a shot. 

http://imgur.com/7ZtTxxu

It's 155 calories, 7 g protein and 5 g carbs, which I realize isn't exactly "high" protein or "low" carb, but it's as close as I can get it while still having it satisfy my sweet-tooth.  Obviously the gum paste flower doesn't factor into any of this, but they don't taste good anyway.

EDIT: The recipe is in the description. Just click the link.  

EDIT 2: Sorry! Did not realize mobile users could not see it! Thaks to those who posted it. I'm putting it up here too for visibility. 


Spray a cupcake tin liberally with no stick cooking spray and then dust with flour until the pan is evenly coated. Dispose of excess flour by turning pan upside down and tap it over a sink or trashcan.
Separate 6 eggs with the yolks in one bowl and the whites in the other. Leave out until eggs are room temperature.


In one bowl beat the 6 egg whites with 1/8th cup sugar and 1/8th cup stevia, on a high speed with a hand mixer until it creates stiff peaks (should take about 10 min, just to be safe)
Preheat oven to 400 F


In other bowl (with the same beaters if you like) beat yolks with 1/4th cup white sugar, 1/4th cup stevia, 1/3 cup cocoa powder 1  tsp vanilla extract and 1/8th tsp salt. Start the mixer on a slow setting or the cocoa powder will go everywhere. As it mixes in more, you can turn it up higher if you want until evenly mixed. Add two scoops of chocolate protein powder and blend until completely mixed (I used GNC soy protein which is 130 calories a scoop and has 25 g of protein. I think the flavor is better than most whey protein I've used)


With a rubber scraper, gently fold the egg yolk mix into the egg white mix until no egg white is showing. Pour the mix into cupcake tin (without the cupcake wrapper/paper things, this mix is too sticky for those, I use a frosting bag to try and seperate them evenly) Fill them about 2/3-3/4 ths full. Should make about 18 cupcakes. Bake for around 12 min.


Put sugar free strawberry jam into a frosting bag and inject about 1 TBS of jam into the center of each hot cupcake.


Put the entire pan in the fridge or freezer, or just wait for it to cool. Trace around each cupcake with a knife to gently free it from the edges of the tin and then gently take them out.


TOPPING


Put 1  cups of heavy cream (chilled) into a bowl (chilled). Add 1/4th cup powdered sugar, 1/4th cup stevia,  cup cocoa powder 1 scoop chocolate protien powder and 2 tsp dry instant coffee, (I like to put it in a ziplock bag and roll over it with a rolling pin to make sure the powder is really fine) and mix with a hand mixer on low until all the powder is mixed in, then beat at high speed until the cream turns into very stiff whipped cream. I put it in another frosting bag and top cupcakes. Keep cupcakes refrigerated. Top with fresh strawberries if you like.
For me, each cupcake ends up being 155 calories, 7 g protien, 5 g carbs, and as far as I or the people I have given it to can tell, it doesn't taste like diet cake, not does it have that artificial sugar or protien aftertaste. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am/was a single mom. I'm actually pretty sure I should not call myself that anymore. My daughter's dad took off when she was two, and after that it was just her and I for over a year. A little over two years ago I met a wonderful man who, not only loves me with all his heart, but loves my daughter as his own. She calls him dad. 

Before my boyfriend and I moved in together, I used to tell people I was a single mom (you know, if it came up in conversation). I actually ended up causing an awkward misunderstanding on two separate occasions, because coworkers asked me out, only to find out I had a bf, and then said "You said you were a single mom." Both of them barely knew me or else they would have known I have  bf. I talk about him a lot. 

I guess I always though the term "single mom" meant you were raising a baby on your own, without the bio-dad, or support from another man filling in the "dad role. Now that my BF is in the "dad roll", and we live together, I don't really identify with the single mom title. I was just more thinking about it today and I was curious what it means to other people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So over the past few months I have been able to return to one of my favorite loves, and that is baking. I never went to school for it, but through tons of practice I have been able to bake at a pretty high-end level, and have sold cakes worth a lot of money before. I stopped quite a while ago because I did not see myself being able to be around cake all day, or worse yet, eat too much of it and resort to purging again.

Anyway, I returned to baking a few months ago and am very excited that I have been able to pretty much squash any and all excess calories that my hobby brings (without the vomiting!). A few days ago I was at the store and got a craving for those Little-Debby mini powdered doughnuts (I know gross, but I like them well enough) and I had tons of calories left in my day to work with. The tube I bought had 6 in it, and was 340 calories, which was much more than I wanted to spend (calorie wise) and so I told myself "I'll eat four and throw the last two away and/or give them to someone." Halfway home and the 4 I allowed myself were eaten and there were the other two just sitting there. They actually made me nervous and I started thinking about them to the point where I got quite irritated, and as soon as I got home, the first thing I did was throw them in the sink and cover them in dish soap (a technique I have not had to "bust out" since I was well over 200 lbs). 

I made a black forest chocolate cake with home made whipped cream, cherries and chocolate ganache (4 layers) for my boyfriend to take to work, and yesterday we found out he would not be able to take it because he would be testing equipment out in the field for the next 5-7 days. So there I was with this DELICIOUS cake (my favorite cake on the planet) and nobody to give it to. I didn't want to keep it for over a week and then send it, I wanted to make a new one. So yesterday I decided I wanted a piece of cake. I cut myself a pretty good sized slice and started in on it. Tasted amazing. Still my favorite cake for sure.... then, 3-4 bites in, I was done. There was still plenty of the slice left, but I was done. I was happy and satisfied. 

What gives? I love my cake way more than those crappy doughnuts. Why is stopping so much harder with them? Why can I make a kick-ass cheeseburger and stop halfway through, but if I go to McDonald's I have the eat the entire bigmac? Why? Anyone else notice this?  </TEXT>

This is my first attempt at a ganache. The first cake I did (the big one) the ganache was way too thin. Oh well. Mistakes are how I learn best. The little cake looked a little better because I threw some more chocolate into it. 

Anyway, this is supposed to be a black forest cake. IT has cherry pie filling and home made whipped cream between the layers. I then froze it and frosted it with a thin layer of buttercream before freezing it, and then putting the ganache over it. This is the 6th cake that I have attempted to do "professionally". I am not however, a professional. Just going along, making mistakes, learning from youtube. I've made tons of box cakes with canned frosting for years, but this is cake 6 that i've tried to make look... you know, good. Tips are welcome! 

Oh and the flowers are gum paste.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So what exactly is the difference in lifting potential for women vs men? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-21 05:31:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A few weeks ago, the boyfriend and I were talking about how a lot of women shy away from lifting because they "don't want to look manly" and how they don't realize how hard a woman would have to try, in order to start putting on as much muscle as a man. This lead me to some questions. 

I'm not sure how easy this would be to quantify, but I'm curious what the difference is for men vs women in lifting potential, as well as muscle mass, not just strength. My boyfriend was talking about a girl who works (as a job) *and* works out, at his gym. She has a TON of muscle and she works very very hard to keep it. He was marveling at how much weight she was using to do dumbbell flies, and then  realized that he did considerably more than she did with his flies. He wasn't tying to say he was better than her or anything, obviously he has the advantage. He lifts quite a bit but not really "professional 100% dedicated, competition" lifting. She on the other hand did. 

So what are we looking at here? Obviously different people put on muscle differently, but I was more wondering for a general number if a man and a woman with identical genes (obviously, other than gender) were to lift, how behind would the girl be? 50%? 75%? 

Also, is it actually possible to get "super mega crazy ripped" as a woman, without juicing? I'm talking like, REALLY ripped here http://forgewellness.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/female-bodybuilder.jpg </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was in high-school I was a tad "gothy". I grew out of it for the most part. I'm 26, and I feel like I dress really well/professional now. I work at Dillard's for one of my jobs, and about 2 days ago, one of the MAC girls grabbed me and put this lipstick on me. 

For the rest of the day, every time I would walk by a reflective surface, my lips surprised me. It's weird because I actually really liked it. At the same time, it was pretty hardcore bold for me. I'm trying to negotiate in my head if it's the teenager inside me that likes this, or if it's entirely possible to look mildly professional with lips like this (assuming it was the right time of day and the right time of year.) 

I just remember years ago when I dyed my hair pitch black and it looked HORRIBLE. I looked so washed out. Now I try to be careful. If I dressed really nice and smiled a lot (something I already do a ton naturally) do you think this would be ok, or does this cross into "teen angst" territory?

What is the dumbest thing you used to believe about health and fitness?

What is the dumbest thing someone has told you about health/fitness?

How many workout buddies did you have to go through before you found one that stuck? (did you find one that stuck? Elaborate if you want)

As a fit (or on your journey to becoming a fit) woman, what is the single most frustrating/challenging thing you deal with, in the realm of health and fitness, that is exclusive to being female?

Do you prefer unisex gyms/classes, or "girls only" ones? Why or why not?

Have you ever felt unsafe at the gym?

How did you get introduced to fitness?

ME: "I can do cardio anywhere."

http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1q7f3h/so_im_really_excited_and_i_figure_this_might_give/

So it's been about 8 months since that thread. I've been weightlifting for 6 months now. I said I would update because I know SO MANY people ask about excess skin, and there are not a whole lot of resources to find info because people are so embarrassed. To be honest, I don't see much of a difference from the middle to the last one, but I have gone down 2 dress sizes. Also the quality is total shit, and I'm sorry about that. Even if it's not shrinking as much as I would like, the skin bothers me less and less. I would once again urge those of you on the fence about losing weight due to the skin, to go for it. Trust me, it's worth it. I still don't even really see myself wearing a bikini in public.

	<TEXT> I'm sure this is a common gripe on here. I'm new and I just kinda need to let off some steam. 

I've been lifting a little over 6 months now. That's not a long time. I know that. I don't claim to be an expert on lifting. Not even close. Still, when I decided to start lifting, I really tried to throw myself into the deep end and absorb as much as I could. 

So I work at a department store that is 95% women (so unfortunately that means, we don't have a lot of people who lift at work). One of the security guards I met when I first started working there, lost 60 lbs. It was really great seeing his progress. I have not lost any weight since I got there, but I had lost 130 lbs before I started working there, and so the security guard and I have a lot in common in regards to fitness and diet. Today, he made a joke at my expense about how I need to tone up. I thought it was funny and I laughed, saying Nah, dude, I'm going to need surgery if I want to get rid of all this skin. The following conversation ensued:

HIM: I have been lifting for 6 months now and my excess skin is almost all gone. You just need to start showing up in the gym. (He has been maintaining at his goal weight for 6 months too)

ME: You're 6'1 and lost 60 lbs. I'm 5'6 and lost 130. Getting ride of all my skin without surgery is not a reality for me. I can make vast and huge improvements with exercise, but it's not going to all go away without surgery. On top of that, what tends to make the loose skin hang more, is if there is more fat attached to the skin. If I could drop my body fat percentage in the single digits, maybe it would almost completely go away, but that's not healthy for a woman (I'm at around 21-23% right now, so I do still need some work.)

HIM: That's just an excuse. You need to push yourself. Just drop your bf% and then fill the excess skin up with muscle.

ME: There's too much skin dude. I would never be able to fill up the excess skin in my arms with enough muscle to make the skin go away. Women don't naturally put on as much raw muscle mass as men. Not without steroids

HIM: There's another excuse! You need to stop curling 5 pound weights for 5 min before you jump on the treadmill and lift for REAL. 

At this point I just dropped it. What really gets me, is this guy is full of bro-science and he walks around spouting it like gospel. In the mean time, If I talk about weight-training, I always have to specify I am on a 3-day split in a 5 days cycle or  something to that effect to prove that I'm actually lifting. If a dude said in a conversation I lift nobody would question it. This guy is a dumb-ass, so I'm not sure why this irks me so much. It reminds me of how my best friend has to spout off her video-game stats when talking to men about video-games in order to prove she doesn't just play The Sims. 

I just hate not being taken seriously about something I am very serious and passionate about. I've even shown him my progress, and yet, it's still not enough.  http://imgur.com/E7yHMnG  Maybe I'm upset because I've tried so hard not to be the quintessential cardio bunny.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So at the age of 26, I guess I figured it was time to learn how to put on makeup correctly. I wore makeup nearly every day since I was about 16, but all I did was put a dark black line on my waterline and smear eye-shadow on my lids. I've literally been "rocking" the 8th grade look up until about 2-3 weeks ago. (Here's an old pic of me from college: http://imgur.com/aZC5pH1  (sorry poor quality, but you can see what I'm talking about as far as bad makeup). 

Well after snooping around on here, and watching you-tube videos made by girls half my age with 10X's the skill, I figure I'll post a before and after. Suggestions are strongly welcome. 

PS: My eyebrows have not been plucked or waxed in over six months. I know they suck and I know it's a problem. I'm still welcome to advice on them. I plan to get them professionally done as soon as pay-day hits, and then will try to maintain them after that. Trust me though, I know they are scary.

	<DATE> 2014-07-21 04:27:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I hate to be such a generic girl, but I feel like my brain has a split personality when it comes to my lifting. I've been at it for six months now, and I feel like I'm beginning to get the bare basics of the "female lifter's" body, albeit, it's very subtle this early on. I am a bulimic who has not relapsed in over 3 years, and I feel very secure in my recovery. Still, there seems to be a part of my brain that is throwing a tantrum at the scale recently. 

I've gained about 5 lbs since I started lifting, but I've dropped down from a size 8 to a 4. I love lifting and I feel better and look better. I'm the smallest size I have ever been (even when I was a practicing bulimic, I was never underweight). I see pictures of me now and to me, it looks like my arms and thighs are exploding and I keep having to tell myself "look at your waist! It's tiny! Calm down!" 

I like my new body. I like what it can do and I know I look sexy. Still, when I look at myself now I find my mind jumping to words like "thick" and "Sturdy", and all my life, all I had ever wanted to be (and was taught to want to be) was delicate and waif-like. On top of everything, last week I got e. coli and I've been put on steroids for it, which is causing me to retain water like a swimming-pool, on top of the fact that I haven't had a period in 4 months because my thyroid-disease threw me for a loop. I just feel huuuge and the scale in my bathroom is fast becoming a torture device again. 

To clarify, I'm not afraid I'm going to get "too big" and "look like a man." I'm not that dumb. I know that's a HUGE misconception. Still, I'm wondering how you ladies cope with the conflicting information you get from society and what you want for yourself. Have any of you ever experienced negativity out in the world due to not fitting the stereotypical "helpless woman" description?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The progression of the species. [I have a stupid question] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-19 00:15:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, sometimes when I've asked stupid questions on here, I've gotten semi-hostile answers. Because of this i'd like to preface that I'm asking this because I am genuinely curious, and not trying to prove a point against atheism. I am, in fact, an atheist, but was raised in christian schools. Because of this, I have tons of stupid questions that most of you already know the answers to. Anyway, here goes. 

My boyfriend and I were talking about how child molesters usually have to be kept away from other people in jail, because even hardened criminals will not tolerate pedophiles. He said "It's like ingrained in us. Survival of the species is the strongest primal urge most people have, and they defend it at all cost." 

He's right, but I started wondering, Why? There is no god. There is nothing after this. Why do we care so much about what happen's to our children, or grad-children, or great-grand-children? 

I feel like I have a good grasp of how evolution works. Do you think maybe, a LOOOOONG way back, one of our ancestors (we're talking ameba here) mutated the inclination to care for it's "young" and so it's "young" survived with the same mutation, and mated with others who survived due to parental care, and mated (or whatever they did) with said other ameba, thus reinforcing the mutation? I wonder if this never happened, would we even exist now?

I mean, if that's right, don't you think it might be the single most reinforced mutation in the word? It's a mutation that causes us to reinforce it, and the only means to do that is to act on that very mutation.... Ok so now my head hurts, but you get it right?

I guess before this I always wondered why caring for our offspring after our own deaths was so important to us, especially for those of us who do not believe in an afterlife. 

Anyway, you guys got anything to add? Do I have it right? Care to go into more detail? 

P.S. I know ameba do not breed, they split. I'm just using that example to try and convey my question through my limited knowledge.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Eating Disorders and weight lifting </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-08 07:57:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was hospitalized for bulimia about 3.5 years ago. I have not relapsed in 3 years, and I feel pretty stable with my sanity these days. Still, one of my biggest issues is that I weigh myself far too often. If the number is low, I have a good day. If it's higher, I feel a bit worse.  

Weight lifting has worked wonders for me. If the thought of purging ever crosses my mind, it is quickly squashed by the knowledge that it will kill my lifts. I can't put up big numbers if I don't eat well. Honestly, it's the single most helpful tool I have found. 

So I've been going at it for 6 months now. (I had lifted in the past but had to take a break for a while because I really hurt my shoulder.) Today I went to my first summer school class and half of the students there, were the same ones I had in a class about 8 months ago. 

Everyone immediately started telling me how great I looked and asked how much weight I lost. I just shrugged. I've been around 140 lbs for almost a year now. When I got home, I dug around on myfitnesspal and discovered that when I took that class in the fall, I was actually 5 lbs *lighter* than I am now. If anything is going to help me quit my scale habit, it's this. 

Just wanted to share and say thank you. If you know anyone who is struggling with an ED, it might be a good idea to mention lifting. I'm in love with it. 

EDIT: This is my progress over the past 6 months. I wish I had taken more flexing pictures, but I think I'm just really obsessed with my butt.

	<TEXT> This popped up on my facebook news feed today. I can't even begin to cover all the problems I have with this article, but if I had to pick one, it would be the rampant "factual" statements he makes without even a shadow of a source. 

This. This is why so many people are so confused about weight loss. This is why I get blank stares when people ask me what my "secrete" is, after I tell them. This is why people at work are sucking a baby-food infused herbal-life shake with a shot of Acai-flavored apple-cider-vinegar, through a bamboo stick, while wearing a detox belly-wrap and buying enemas online from India.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've moved around quite a bit, back and forth, between two cities several times, that are about an hour away from one another. 

I'm ridiculously busy, and I suck at keeping up with friends, so most of my socializing happens on facebook. I'm very open about my weight-loss and post progress pictures on facebook, as well as talk about when I've reached certain fitness goals. The response has been overwhelmingly supportive and positive. Still, something keeps happening. It's actually happened twice this week. 

People I have not seen in a while, lately have been extremely apologetic about their weight. Specifically, my overweight friends. They bring it up, not me. It's subtle but they will say things like "You're doing so great. Heck, I've put on weight since we last saw each other! I really need to do something about it. I'm so lazy/fat/out-of-control/gross" Whenever they say stuff like this, the text comes off as embarrassed and ashamed. It makes me sad. They say such self-deprecating things. 

You don't owe me an explanation. If I didn't like you I wouldn't be your friend. It breaks my heart because I know exactly how it feels, and yet I find myself struggling to find the words I should say. I can't really say "Don't worry about it! You're fine the way you are!" not because I don't feel that way, more-so it sounds disingenuous when I've worked so hard not to be in that place anymore. If I tell them "Hey you should come work-out with me! Or let me help you with your diet!" I feel like it makes me come off as a judgmental bitch, especially since they are not really asking for my help.   

So I just sit there watching the cursor blink, without anything to say. I over-think my response, just because tone is so hard to convey at times in text, and end up with nothing to say. 

EDIT: You know what? I want to take something back. After thinking about it a while, I don't want to tell people "You are fine the way you are" because I don't think they are, and it has nothing to do with their weight.

 If I had an overweight friend who didn't care they were overweight, then they would be "fine the way they are". (From a lifestyle standpoint, not health, but I don't get on my friends who smoke either. It's not my place). The reason they are not "fine the way they are" is because they have explained to me in detail how unhappy they are, and that isn't ok. I want my friends to be happy. I love them. Life is too short to hate yourself.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I curious about men's primal feelings towards reproduction and their offspring. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-03 05:35:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm a sing mom (As in the father of my child no longer wants to be a part of her life, not that my relationship status is single) and I've always just wondered what men felt as far as their offspring. Obviously, everyone is different, but I just have so many questions about this subject in general. This is both due to the fact that my daughter's biological dad wants nothing to do with her, and also that I am dating a guy who seems to care about my daughter. I also just have a bunch of other questions that I've always wondered about. Answer the ones that pertain to you. I'm just really curious about the male experience as a whole. 

1. While dating or married to a woman who has been pregnant with your child, did you feel any sort of emotional connection to the unborn baby? Was it something that came on all at once when you got to hold the child for the first time, or did you feel it before that? What if you were not together, did you still feel a connection? 

2. When having sex with a woman, have you ever felt a primal urge to impregnate her? I've just talked to fellow girls several times, and I have found that sometimes, In the heat of passion, especially if they are with someone they love, they will get this feeling of just "wanting to bare your child" even if after the moment has ended, they know getting pregnant would be a really bad idea at the moment. Does that happen to men? 

3. Have you ever gotten attached to a child that was not biologically yours the way you are (or think you would be) attached to your own biological children? 

4. Do men have that "biological urge" to reproduce the way women do? I mean, I know we all have the urge for sex, but I'm talking about that urge to nurture and care for offspring, not just sex. Do you all experience a physical longing to rear a child the way many women do?

I realize these are all really strange questions but I've been wondering this stuff for a long time, and I'm very interested in the male perspective. Thanks in advance!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does anyone here not enjoy the actual physical act of running while they are doing it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-28 05:13:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hear me out. So I used to HATE running. As a former fat person, I would say the majority of fat people hate running, because it's extremely uncomfortable when you are fat. Still, I'm sure there are fat people out there who love it. 

I started running because I want to complete a marathon. It's always been this thing in my head that I felt like I must accomplish. One of those things that, for me, represents a "If I can do that, I can do anything" milestone. I didn't even start really running until I was in a normal weight range, and I still consider myself a novice runner. I'm a total baby at it, and I'm not very good. 

Still, I don't hate running anymore. I actually kind of love it. I love how it makes me feel during my day, when I had run that morning. I love how much confidence it has given me in myself. I love the "runner's high". I love the way my body is changing because of it. Still, a few min before I start my run, I'm thinking "Alright, let's just get this over-with". While I am physically in the act of running, I don't hate it anymore, but I am thinking "Alright, let's just keep on a little further." and I do feel a slight sense of relief when I see I'm nearing the end of my run. I guess I would describe my feeling while I'm in the act of running as "mildly uncomfortable". 

Anyone out there feel like this, but still consider themselves a "runner"? Anyone out there used to feel this way, and has found that they actually enjoy the physical act of running now? Does this mean maybe I'm not a "runner" and should find a different means of cardio once I complete my marathon?

The only exercise I've found that I enjoy while I'm doing it, is weight lifting, and I recognize that cardio is just as important as weight lifting, if not more. Still, I have dreams where I'm running really fast, and it's effortless, and I actually LOVE those dreams. It's absolutely exhilarating. Is this attainable in real life while running short distances (3-6 miles)? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Weight-Lifting Butt progress. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-26 02:53:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello again friends! 


So I just wanted to update with my weight-lifting progress. Once again, as many of you know, the main reason that I started lifting was to, 1) Get a butt and 2) strengthen my back (I fractured l1 and T12 when I was 16.)


I'm starting to really like the way things are turning out and would like to re-emphasize the benefits of tightening up through weight training, especially for those of us who have lost enough weight to feel floppy. I'm happy to say that about 50% of the time, my back is completely pain free, which is not something I have experienced in over a decade. Even when I am experiencing some pain and discomfort, it tends to be less severe than before. Hopefully with continued lifting, it will completely go away. 


Also, really liking the butt progress. I have my One-Rep-Maximum for squats at 200 lbs (at parallel), my Dead-Lift is at 185 lbs and bench-press is at 95... which is terrible, but I'm happy with the other two.  The first 3months I went with a medium rep, medium weight simple routine. These last three months, I went with a higher rep, lower weight routine, which also includes several more lifts than the last one. If anyone is interested in either, please let me know.  


I would also like to re-emphasize how much more I can eat while maintaining my current weight, because the body burns more calories when it has to maintain muscle. Those of you who like to eat big, weightlifting is for you! 

It also helps a lot for those of you, who like myself, might have an eating disorder. It's very hard for me to think about starving myself or purging if I know that it will stop me from being able to set new strength records for myself. It really keeps me in a good head-space.

	<TEXT> I've written in here before about my paralyzing fear of death. Most of the answers I got were along the lines of "You felt nothing before you were born, it's just like that!" The problem is that this idea bring me no comfort. It seems to help the majority of atheists, but not me. Not even a little. It's the nothing that scares me, not the pain. 

I was raised in a cult, so religion was very much a part of my formative years. I fear it has dug a trench in my mind that I have no hope of escaping. I was never taught to cope with death, only to know that I was going to heaven after I die. 

I try not to think about it because if I did for too long, I'm 100% sure I would have a complete psychological break. Even the issue crossing my mind in fleeting nearly sends me into a panic attack. I wish I could go back to being a "believer", but no matter how hard I try,I just CAN'T. I've seen the light. No turning back. I think it's only a matter of time before I become agoraphobic for fear of being in an accident. 

I realize I'm being a dramatic ass-hat, but I'm crying my eyes out right now. I'm so fucking scared. Please help me. 

EDIT: People keep telling me in this thread that I will not experience "nothingness" , because I will not exist to experiencing anything at all. I get that. That is exactly what scares me. Ceasing to exist.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently lost 132 lbs. Suddenly, I've gone from "Almost never gets hit on" to, "If I'm not mean about saying no, they will keep trying." I grew up fat. I was always fat. Now, I feel like I'm ill equipped to handle aggressive men. I'm an extremely social person. I make friends like it's my job. Still, when it comes to getting hit on by a guy aggressively, I freeze up bad. 

A few days ago at work (retail), we had a guy who looked to be in his 70's come in (I'm 26). He immediately started to lightly flirt with me. Ok, cool. Old guys hit on me all the time and I flirt back a bit and humor them, mostly because I almost always never took them seriously. Well things quickly turned wrong. He started getting really explicit and nasty. At this point I froze up. Suddenly I wasn't talking much, because I didn't know what to say. 

He took that as an insult I guess, and he got mad and started telling me I needed a boob job, as well as several other mean things about my body. At that point, I got overwhelmingly anxious, and didn't say a word. I was frantically trying to think of how I could get this guy off my back without being rude and losing my job. Finally, as he escalated, I ended up just turning around and walking away while he was in mid-sentence. I then sat in the back and listened to him asking one of my co-workers what time I got off. Thankfully, she lied.

This has never happened to me to this extent before, but it happens to a lesser degree quite often. When I was fat, I used to feel "lucky" to be hit on by anyone. If I wasn't interested in a guy back then, saying "Oh, I'm sorry, you are great and all, but I have a boyfriend"  would make them go away. Now when I say that, many guys keep trying. I hate being mean. I don't have a mean bone in my body. Ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so don't laugh...

VERY new "runner" here. I've just started training for a marathon. The most I have ever run in one go was 3.5 miles, and I'm slow as hell. I plan to be training for the next 18 months. 

Anyway, I wanted to get my brain around how far 26.2 really is, so I walked a half marathon today. Honestly, I thought I could walk a whole marathon this morning, but holy shit, that is no joke!! Anyway, I just took my shoes off and the nail-beds of both my big toes are in a lot of pain. If i try and squeeze it I might scream. Towards the last mile or so, I was starting to feel pain there. 

It's a bit like when you drop something heavy on your toe and then, when you put opposing pressure on your toe as you walk, it causes a sharp pain in the nail bed. What is this and how can I avoid it in the future? My toe-nails are not long but they are not super super short right now. I also have those sort of nails where it points up a bit instead of laying flat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had quite a few piercings when I was a teenager. I'm becoming a teacher now,and as much as it sucks, I've had to take most of them out. Still, every time I got a piercing in the past, it was always a huge commitment to really wanting it and taking care of it,and dealing with the discomfort for months. 

I currently have 2 earlobe piercings on each ear, and one cartilage piercing on each ear, and then a nostril piercing. The first time I got my nose pierced, it hurt for about 6 months, then it got pulled out in my sleep, and by the time I woke up, it was totally closed. The second time, it took just as long, but it didn't get pulled out and it finally stopped hurting after maybe 7 months.  

My ear cartilage piercings took just as long. I got my second earlobe ones most recently (this is for like the 4th time because infection or pain made me take them out before) I got them pierced January 10th. They don't really hurt anymore, but they still weep a bit and sometimes they feel uncomfortable and irritated. Also, if I took the piercings out for more than like maybe 4 hours, I know they would close. 

Every time I get pierced, I have to go back to the piercer for an extended bar because I always swell like crazy. I ALWAYS go to a professional, in very well known and respected shops. I ALWAYS follow my aftercare instructions religiously, and I am a very clean and hygienic person. What gives? Also, many shops have had me try several different metals and nothing makes any difference. I love the look of piercings, and I feel like it's still worth it to me, because once I can get through the gauntlet, they look good and I don't have problems with them anymore. 

Why does this happen? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My husband and I divorced right after our daughter's 2nd birthday. She's about to turn 5 in July. She loves her dad. In the near three years he and I have been apart, I would say he has spent a cumulative total of about a solid 10 days of time with her. We live in the same city, I have told him multiple times I would take her to see him any time he wished. 

I've received a total of 120$ in child support from him in the last (almost) three years. Half the time when he is watching her, I will get a call and have to leave work or school to go get her because "He doesn't want to deal with her anymore." He did this again yesterday and I snapped and went off on him (Not in front of our kid, I never talk crap about him around her). He basically told me, not exaggerating, "You should just marry your boyfriend and have him adopt her if you think I'm such a bad dad." I asked him (because I was curious and shocked) "Are you saying you would relinquish your parental rights?" and he said "Yep."

My ex husband is not dangerous, he's just lazy. He's expressed to me several times about how sometimes he just wants to be done with "all of this." Still, he won't actively try and relinquish his rights, he was just saying that if I perused it, he would not stop me. 

I'm getting a lot of conflicting advice from a lot of people. I don't want to be the reason my daughter doesn't know her dad. I also don't want him to keep jerking her around and hurting her. If he did give up his rights, she would miss him very much for some time, but eventually, she might start healing. Right now, when he keeps ducking in and out of her life, he re-opens those wounds and she has to start healing all over. At the same time, I don't want her to harbor resentment for me because I took her away from him. 

I honestly don't know what to do. Any of you had a similar situation? Any of you grow up not knowing your dad? Any of you grow up knowing your dad and wish you had not?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Fat to fit </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-26 04:52:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I hope I'm doing this right. A few people asked if I had done one these yet, and I told them I have not, but that I would. I'll try to keep it brief. 


I had been fat since about age 7-8. The first time I remember being aware of my weight (the number I mean) I was 185 lbs in 8th grade at about 5'1". I remember ALWAYS feeling fat, even before I actually was fat. I grew up in a very heavily hispanic city and I was taller than most of the girls in class, and I felt like I had a wider bone-structure, so I think that might be why I felt fat before I actually was. 

So in 8th grade I was 185 lbs. I was over 200 by the end of freshman year. I graduated at 230 lbs. I went off to college and lost about 20 lbs simply because I was too lazy to walk to the cafeteria. I got my own place, and gained the weight back. Then I got pregnant and gained 40 lbs. 3 Months after I gave birth to my daughter, I was 270 lbs and 5'6" tall. This was me. This was the picture that got me to change. 

http://i.imgur.com/6li56DW.jpg

I was 21 in that picture. I knew I didn't want my daughter to grow up fat, because growing up fat SUCKS. So I knew I had to lead by example. I lost 110 lbs in 9 months. About halfway through the process something went wrong in my head and I became bulimic. I guess I was so scared I'd gain it all back that the anxiety took over. This picture was taken a few days before I was hospitalized. 

http://imgur.com/nsPZtHz

I basically crashed my gallbladder and got a gallstone so big it impacted and I went septic and had to have emergency surgery to save my life. Bulimia almost killed me. I am all my daughter has, so I was really afraid if I continued on the path I was on, she was going to end up an orphan. I was too scared to diet when I got home, so I went back to my old fatty ways and gained 90 of the 110 lbs I lost in a year. 

After about 18 months, I had my head feeling better and I started up again. This time THE RIGHT way. This was about a month before I started up again.

So I went on, through calorie counting and exercise, to lose 130 lbs (from my highest weight). Here's a picture of me the day I hit 140. (PLEASE excuse the horrid hair)

http://imgur.com/RzlDBif

After that I started really upping my exercise. I also started weightlifting 4.5 months ago, because I wanted my ass back. Here are my 3 month results:

Aaaand a bit of face progress. 

http://imgur.com/rGPLZ3S

I've been at 140 lbs for about 8 months now. I've gone from a size 8 to a size 4, without any weightloss, simply by weightlifting. I still want to lose 10 lbs. 

EDIT: Forgot to say, I have not relapsed in my eating disorder in over 3 years. When people find out how fat I used to be, I'll get people saying "You lost over ONE-HUNDRED lbs!?" and I reply "Twice."  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok, so I didn't win them, my spotter did. I've been lifting for 4 months or so, and I LOVE it. I've been doing cardio for about 18 months now, about an hour a day, three out of every five days. (I count my cycles in 5 days instead of by the week and I do a 3 day split in those five days and 3 hours of cardio at least.) 

I just bought some MMA gloves (See, I don't even know what they fuck they are called) a few weeks ago because I'm actually interested in learning some stuff, but I was going to do it on my own. My spotter won a free month of MMA lessons on the radio. At first she was really excited, but soon realized she had no time for them and so she decided to give them to me. I turned her down several times and even offered to drive her there, but she insisted and I have to say i'm REALLY excited. 

Still I'm nervous. I have a home gym and feel like I'm allergic to looking like an idiot in public. I've lost 132 lbs (I'm 5'6", 140 lbs) and I feel semi-fit, but I'm sure people doing MMA are a whole new level of fit. I'm also female and, like almost anything that is not specifically aimed at women in the gym, I expect to be the only girl there, or if I'm lucky, there might be one or two other girls. Sparring with a super-fit male makes me nervous, both because I'm going to look like an idiot (that's a given) but also because I'm afraid I'll get hurt. I consider myself a pretty tough person but my right shoulder is totally fucked. I've dislocated it more times than I can count, but it's in the upper 20's to lower 30's at this point. I'm also paranoid that my clothes are going to get bunched up during grappling and someone is going to see my excess skin as a result. Is trying to learn MMA a stupid idea for me? 

What should I bring with me on my first lesson?

Any Tips?

To do and not to do? 

What to wear to an MMA class?

Words of wisdom? 

EDIT: I just want to say, before anyone gets touchy about it, I'm really not trying to make this an "I'm a girl, look at me! I'm fragile!" post. I'm just trying to be accurate. I'm smaller and have less muscle mass and power than a male. I also have an injury that could cause issues. Lastly, as much as it sucks, we all know in most cases, non-cardio-centric  classes tend to attract a predominantly male clientele.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know this subreddit is mostly about weightlifting, which is something I do and love doing, but I actually have a question about running. I thought about asking loseit, but that is predominantly about weight loss and diet. 


So I've lost 132 lbs. Female, 5'5" 138-140 lbs. I'm no stranger to exercise. I've been exercising regularly for 18 months or so, and believe me when I say, I take pride in pushing myself to near breaking point. I'm not one of those people who freak out as soon as their muscles start burning, or when I get nauseous or whatever. 


That being said, I hate running and no matter how light I get, I still hate it and it's still very hard for me. I don't even know why I do it because there are plenty of other cardio activities that I am better at and enjoy more. I think I do it simply because I've told myself for so long that I can't run, that now I do it because it pisses me off when I tell myself I can't do something.


Whenever I'm done running, my lungs BURN. I live in a warm climate so it's not because it's cold. It very painful. Painful enough that I have to lay down and squeeze a pillow or something while I'm gritting my teeth for about 15 min. I hate it. I'm not going to stop running unless it turns out to be bad for my health/or dangerous, but I really dread the pain and it even gives me very slight anxiety before a run. 


Please believe me when I say, I don't think I'm just being a baby. It really hurts. Whats going on? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 



I'm trying to figure out the best way to word this, but I'm sort-of looking to train someone. I helped one of my online friends lose 70 lbs over the past year. Being there for her and helping her along has been a very rewarding experience for me. No lie, she put in all the effort, but I really enjoyed being there for her. 


I'd like to maybe do the same thing for three or so people from here. As many of you know, I am always open to answering questions from people who have them, but in this case I would like to maybe take three people from the beginning to end of their weight loss journey while helping them in a more in-depth way. In the beginning, maybe I could work with you on setting up your diet and exercise program, and then doing weekly progress reports to answer questions and tweak the diet and exercise program. 


A few weeks ago I saw someone offer to help another person on here, and the person who offered help was immediately bombarded by dozens of people asking for the same help. I was so surprised at the need I saw for people wanting help and guidance. I'm not a doctor, I'm no expert. Heck, I've learned the most through failure more than anything, but I feel like I could be of some help, however big or small it might be. I've toyed with the idea of maybe seeking a career in helping people lose weight, but I am by NO MEANS any sort of expert right now. I would need a lot more education in order to do something like that, but I am interested in trying some things with people. 


Like I said, ideally, I would only want to take on about three people at a time. I'm a single mom, I have two jobs and I am in full time graduate school, so to say I am short on time is an understatement. Still, I seem to find the time to brows reddit for at least an hour a day. I feel like I could at least use that time to help, or at the very least, encourage people to be healthier. Ideally, I would like to work with people who want to lose more than 60 lbs. I'd love to train a man, but I have to admit, I am a woman, and only have experience working with women in the past. It is because of this that I think I would only want one out of three of these people to be a man. I'd hate to come across something male-related that I didn't know how to get past, and have all three of the people have the same issue, and end up failing. Still, I do want experience helping men, so I would like one of them to be a man. 


I'm not a doctor. Not even close. I also have no experience with any issues such as diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, injuries, conditions etc etc.. So if you have one of these, that's fine with me, but YOU would have to be the expert on your own health issues and be able to discern if  I suggest for you to do something that you know you should not do. I DO have quite a bit of experience with eating disorders, but I would still stress that if you have one of these, that the responsibility of staying healthy is on you. With ANY issue, I will try and help you as best I can, but I'm not a doctor or a councilor or an expert in ANYTHING.  Still, I feel like I could be useful. 


So yeah, let me know if you are interested/ fit the criteria. Even if you are not, anyone on here is welcome to comment on here or send me a PM with questions or if you are in need of encouragement.

	<TEXT> I originally started lifting 3 months ago because I completely lost my butt when I lost weight. It was non existent. My boyfriend lovingly referred to me as "no butt". I just crossed the 3-month threshold and although my butt is still tiny, I'm very pleased with the results. Don't just do squats though. try to work everything. I know people say it all the time, but it REALLY helps tighten you up. I'm beginning to feel like I can have almost anything I want body-wise. Everything feels attainable now. You want a nice butt? You can have it. You want bigger biceps? You can have it. You want nice legs, you can have it. I'm a bit upset I waited so long to start lifting.

	<TEXT> I just want to start by saying that although I am mildly frustrated, this post does not come from a place of malice. I'm just a little frustrated at trying to find clothes that fit me well. 


I used to love stores like Torid and Maurice's when I was plus sized. FINALLY! A store that sold trendy clothes in my size! Great!


Still, now that I am no-longer plus sized, I'm having a bit of trouble. I'm not complaining, really. I can walk into any store now and buy something off the rack that will fit me. This was something I was NEVER able to do 130 lbs ago. I'm just searching for something that fits me "well". 


There is a 12 inch difference between my hips and waist. There is an 11 inch difference from my bust to my waist. Most size charts have me at a medium in the hips, a small in the waist, and a medium/large in the bust. I worked so hard for this body, I want to show it off with clothes that fit right. Still, every time I google or look for clothes for curvy girls, I get nothing but plus sizes. Anyone know of any places that have clothes made for curvy girls that come in a size 4-6?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Alright, this is going to be long, but I'm begging you, if you know anything that might help me, please let me know. 


I was born with fine, thin hair. It's naturally light brown / dark blonde (not sure). Last time I saw my natural hair color, I was about twelve years old. Here is a picture of my daughter, who has the same color hair that I do. (She pretty much has my exact same hair, so if you help me, maybe I can help her when she gets older). 


http://imgur.com/m1i8BEM


So it was thin to begin with. Then, at around 12, my brother started teasing me about how he could see my scalp in the sun because my hair was so thin/light. Around this time, my mom started letting me color my hair, so I picked red. I fell in love instantly. I've done other colors in the past, but I always go back to red. I've been doing it so long, I really identify myself with the red color. Still, I'm desperate enough at this point, I'd even be willing to stop coloring it if you all thought it might help. I noticed once it was a darker color, you could not see my scalp as easily, so I liked that. 


Anyway, at the age of 16, my health tanked and I was diagnosed with hashimoto's disease, which is not very serious, but one of the side effects is thinning hair. I am now 26, and I have recently lost 132 lbs, so that didn't help my thinning hair either. I've been a my current weight for over 6 months now, and because I'm weight-lifting, I do track my protein and make sure to get plenty of it. 


Over the past six months, I've really put in the effort to finally try and fix my hair. On top of the coloring, I blow-dry and straiten my hair nearly every day. This pic is old, but it shows what my hair looks like if I let it dry naturally (left side). 


http://imgur.com/UktyRdB


So I've been taking biotin and folic acid and vitamin A and D and maybe 5-other kinds of vitamins that say they help hair (as well as prenatal). I've been using men's rogaine foam. I'm using Nutriox shampoo and conditioner, folicure treatments twice a week, keratin treatments, hair masks of all kinds... It's getting fucking expensive. After all that, I'm not seeing too much progress. Sometimes I think it's getting better, but I always fall victim to the placebo effect. I just want it to work so bad.  


One of my friends talked me out of just giving up and getting extensions, convincing me that they cause balding. I DID however, on a whim, buy human hair clip-in extensions. I wear them 6-8 hours a day 3-4 days a week (only at work really). The second I put those things in,  felt SO BEAUTIFUL. I never realized how self-conscious I was about my hair until that moment. Now, not using them makes me want to cry when I'm out in public. Here's some pictures with the extensions 


http://imgur.com/YiaJiTn


http://imgur.com/wCHFpjw


The clip-in extensions are fine. The only issue is, I'm a rough-and-tumble kind of girl. I would not go so far as to say that the extensions irritate me, but I am ALWAYS aware of them and worrying about the tops showing. I would love more than anything to have my real hair look like this.... Instead of this:

So yeah. Please. Give it to me strait. Help me!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read over the wiki, and I have posted on here a tiny bit, but I guess this is my first real I need some serious advice post. I usually only post in r/loseit, but have recently started to come over here quite a bit. I realize that nobody can tell me what my body should look like, but I feel like a need a bit of outside help with it.


ATTENTION: If you want the short version of this post, only read paragraphs 1, 5, 6 and 7. 


1.


I'm 5'5, female, 140 lbs, 26 years old and 20-23% body fat. I've lost 130 lbs over the past two years. My ancestors are from Holland, and I have a medium frame size (as far as I can tell.) 


2.



Growing up fat, I always wanted to be a waif. If I could have waved a magic wand I would have given myself a body like Winona Ryder in Girl Interrupted. Not just that but I wanted to be short. I just wanted to be altogether small.  I remember as a teenager, crying when I hit 5'4. To me, being very slim and short and small was what being feminine was. It was everything I was not. 


3.


When I was 21, I started losing weight. I started doing it the right way, but I got lost along the way, and to make a long story short, I lost 110 lbs in 8-9 months through anorexia and bulimia, bulimia being the main tool I used. I was hospitalized and had to have surgery to save my life and then I went into treatment (at 160 lbs, which was fucking embarrassing to me at the time.) During my recovery I discovered weightlifting. Holy Shit. Weightlifting saved my life. I loved it. I loved feeling strong. I stopped starving myself because if I did, I was not able to put up as much weight. It made me view my body as a machine and food as fuel, instead of this evil entity. (Side note, if you know anyone with an ED, I highly suggest getting them to start lifting.) 


4.


Well I ended up dislocating my shoulder, and then doing it about 25-30 more times after that. It effectively killed my lifting. I stopped exercising, and I was still too mentally fragile to really diet without fear of relapse. That year I gained 95 lbs back. I can't describe to you haw terrible that felt. After a lot of work on myself mentally, at the age of 24, I started losing weight again, this time the healthy way. Now I'm at 140 lbs, -130 from my highest weight, and have maintained for about 6 months now. At the beginning of January, my boyfriend developed a lifting plan for me that was designed not to irritate my shoulder. It's been AMAZING. I love it. I have not missed one day since I started. 


5.


Calipers don't work on me because I have a ton of excess skin. 4-5 months ago, I had a few trainers and a doctor estimate me to be at about 25% body fat. Since then, I have lost no weight, but I have lost quite a few inches all over my body, and now the estimates from the doctor and trainer-friends is sitting at about 20-23%. 



6.


My goal weight has always been 130 lbs, but I'm beginning to think that I need to change my goals. I still deep down, want to be a waif, but I'm noticing I'm naturally a pretty curvy girl, and my bone structure does not seem conducive to the skinny pixy body type I love so much. Also, I don't want to stop lifting because it is SO HELPFUL to me both physically and mentally. I also like being strong. If it's true that I am at 20-23% body fat (lets go with 23 for now) that means only 32 lbs of my body weight is fat, and if I lost 10 lbs of pure fat (because I don't want to lose muscle) then my body fat % would be too low for a girl. In all honesty, I don't want to go below 20% body fat, because girls who have less than that (to me) look less feminine. I like having rounder edges. I don't want to look extremely cut. 


7.


The problem is, I still have killer body dimorphia, and I still feel fat about 50% of the time. People tell me I can't tell you what your goal should be, you should just go until you like what you see in the mirror but I don't think that will work for me. If you were me, what would you do? Am I at a healthy size now? Am I in my ideal body weight? What should I be focusing on? Any advice? Sorry, this post feels silly, but I'm still feeling really lost and in need of guidance and direction.

	<TEXT> So when I first started this whole thing, and honestly up until I had lost half my excess weight, I hated exercise. I would have rather starved all day than have been able to eat and exercise. I did absolutely no strength training, and cardio? Don't talk to me about cardio... 


Well my boyfriend has been in the army going on 17 years now, and he designs a lot of exercise plans for his men. He kind of had the opposite problem as me. He is one of the fittest people I have ever known. He could exercise all day long, but his problem was in the kitchen. We both have struggled with our weight our entire lives. 


Well, I'm not sure exactly how he did it, but somewhere along my halfway point for weight loss my boyfriend just sort-of came up to me and said We're going to go exercise and somehow I allowed this. No idea how he pulled that off. I started very basic. Did some time on a brand new stationary bike he bought. I started walking a ton, because the dog needed to lose weight. Little things here and there. I even gave running a try for a while (hahaha... running..).


The Army periodically takes my boyfriend away from me (like they do) for 4-6 weeks at a time, maybe 3-4 times a year because they go out in the field to do... army shit... so I found myself really motivated during those times to really push myself physically so that I could show off when he came home. Slowly, I started getting hooked to the feeling exercise gave me, until I felt bad if I was not exercising. Well I got down to 140 (which I am still at) and hit a massive plateau. Around the beginning of January, somehow, my boyfriend once again, managed to get me to start lifting weights. 


Weight lifting was different for me than other exercise. I loved it almost instantly. Two weeks in, I got my tax return and bought a bench-press and a squat rack, along with a whole mess of plates and equipment. I LOVE weightlifting. Today I just completed my 15th weight-lifting cycle (I am on a 5 day cycle) so that makes 75 days. I have not missed one day, and all that exercise has chalked up to about 113 hours of exercise. I feel amazing. I feel capable. It feels like almost every situation I go into these days, I go in with confidence that I am capable of doing what needs to be done. This goes for mental tasks as well. 


Not only that, but even though I am still counting calories, I have relaxed a ton on how restrictive my diet is being. I can now basically go through my day eating as much as I want (as long as I am making healthy choices) and my weight is rock solid. No more wild swings. It used to be that the day after I had a cheat day or a bad day my weight would jump up anywhere between 5-8 lbs the next morning and it made me want to jam my finger down my throat. Now I see almost no fluctuation at all, and I can pretty much go through my day feeling like, and eating like, a normal person. Exercise has also re-worked my body so that I am famished in the morning, and not very hungry at night. I used to never eat breakfast and graze all night. Even though I have not lost any more weight, I'm losing inches like crazy. Today I slipped comfortably into a Junior's size 5, which I'm told is around a womans size 4. 


Because of my excess skin, calipers do not work on me, but I've seen a few personal trainers and a doctor, and they roughly estimate me to be at around 20-22% body fat, which lands me in the athletic category. I was shocked to hear it too, but the more I think about it, yeah. I'm an athlete. That's something I never thought I would ever be able to say about myself. Also, as of today I have walked 301 total miles, and the dog has lost 14 lbs. 


Anyway, some silly attempts of mine to show off muscles

	<TEXT> I recently re-connected with one of my best friends from high school. Since then, she has become my spotter, and I'll be damned if she isn't the best workout buddy I have ever had. Her name is Anna. 

So Anna was at one of her friend's house (Stephanie) for Stephanie's birthday. Stephanie got a really cool t-shirt from her husband. Anna told her "You should put it on!!" and Stephanie said "Maybe later" to which Stephanie's husband replied (Jokingly) "I'll put it on!" Stephanie and Anna laughed and Stephanie said "You'll stretch it out!" to which the husband got offended and insisted that he was not fat. 

Now Anna has told me that Stephanie has been worried about her husband's weight for some time. (I've never met them) So after a lot of back and forth, the husband claiming he isn't big, and he only wears a 2XL because "My neck is wide", Anna convinced him that he should come with her to work out with both of us and have me use my calipers to test his body fat percentage. He agreed that if his BF% indicated he needed to lose fat, that he would start working on it. 

So Stephanie really wants him to go because she is worried about him, and Anna insists that he is totally cool about it, and down to do it. And he wants to do it to show them he isn't fat. I just feel a little weird being expected to measure this guy and tell him he needs to lose weight. I've seen pictures of him. Not one doubt in my head that he needs to lose a good 40-60 lbs. (obviously I'm not a doctor, just my opinion)

How do I go about doing this correctly (as far as what I tell him, I know how to use the calipers.) Should I just tell them no?
