But, in order to make them aware of that, I feel like I would have to dishonor them on some level and bring a record of wrongs which the bible specifically says not to keep. At the same time, I know if I do not do this, they will continue to act in the same wrongful way and further stray from the path of God. What do I do. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Some stray thoughts on the tiebreaker twist </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-01 14:15:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think a couple of things regarding this twist that people aren't realizing, that make it not so bad, are that 1) the people who are tied for votes can't participate in the decision on who to send home and 2) if a minority alliance member somehow doesn't have votes (say in a 3-3-3 tie, for example) and can therefore push it to rocks, they won't necessarily want to, because they will be eligible to draw rocks as well. I really don't think much will be different with this new rule. People will be more hesitant to vote in ties which is bad because it means less people will be making moves, but there won't be more rock draws imo.

What I personally don't like about the new rule is that it makes idols a thousand times more powerful. Sure flushing the idol was a tired strategy, but it at least was a defense against the idol. Now, there are only two options to defend against someone with an idol if they aren't severely outnumbered: stack all of your votes on them and hope that they don't vote for you and play the idol--which is essentially the same as forcing a tie and going to rocks--or just let that person coast through to the final 5. Considering how easy it's been to find idols in recent seasons, I really don't think this is a good idea because suddenly the game is just about finding idols and not actually socializing or strategizing anymore. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-25 12:54:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From the videos and other media I've seen of this game, I've felt pretty underwhelmed. I think I've been able to pinpoint why. It's not because the worlds feel empty like a lot of people are saying, although I agree they do, I think it's more because they are...too open. To the point where, everything I've seen so far, has been like one giant, open stage rather than an actual world with different parts. Having an open world is great, but at a certain point, it begins to feel unrealistic.

From playing the toybox (which I realize isn't a level in the actual game, but it also has this feeling for me, so I'm including it), and from the videos I have seen of the different in game levels, it just feels like you're in a wide open box with some different platforms and structures inside of it, but otherwise, you're just in a large space. That makes it feel/look very fake imo. If you look at the different levels in BK, BT, and DK64, yes they are segmented because they had to be with the technology at the time, but beyond that, the levels felt like real places, with different areas that weren't completely connected with every single other area. There were paths to take and choose from, and rooms to explore, and characters and scenery to interact with. YL just hasn't felt that way from what we've been shown.

I don't know if any of this made sense, but I'd be interested in seeing how other people feel about it. I want to be excited about this game, I want it to be good so bad...but I'm feeling a bit worried.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The beauty of the Anna boot episode in Kaoh Rong </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-24 13:22:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> No pun intended. I am rewatching this season in preparation for Game Changers, and I really think this episode was overshadowed by the swapfuck of Anna and the craziness of the episodes before and after it. But I just watched it and...I think it's actually the most strategically complex episode of the entire season.

The reason why is because every single person on the new Gondol tribe is trying to pull the vote a different way. **Aubry** wants to vote out a beauty, as she knows that there will be a beauty (julia) replacing whoever is voted out, and really wants to vote out Tai because Anna told her he has an idol (and she doesn't realize Anna and Julia are in an alliance), but ultimately decides to vote for Anna to secure Joe's trust. **Joe** wants to vote out a beauty as well, but wants to vote out Anna because he values how hard Tai works and doesn't think there is any chance of him having an idol. **Peter** will go along with whatever Aubry and Joe do, but also tries to throw them under the bus by revealing their plan to the beauties/brawn. **Tai** wants to vote out Peter because his arrogance rubs him the wrong way, and wants to use his hidden immunity idol to do it. He revels the idol to Anna and Scot in order to get them to go along with the plan, however, he is dissuaded from this plan by Scot, and decides to blindside Anna and keep his idol, because he trusts Scot's advice and is confident enough that he isn't being targeted. **Anna** originally targets Tai because she knows that the brains want to vote out a beauty and she hasn't trusted Tai since the beginning, and she tries to make an alliance with them. When Tai shows her his idol, though, she decides to vote against the brains and blindside Peter using Tai's idol. She ultimately fails in convincing the brains to vote Tai, and mistakenly believes that Tai is going to play the idol on her, although it was probably true when he first said it. What she doesn't realize is that **Scot**, who also secretly has an idol, also got close to the Brains, and was told their plan to vote out Anna, and believed it. Knowing this, and with the close bond he formed with Tai, he convinces Tai to vote with him against Anna and not play his idol, because he wants to use Tai's idol later in the game. The funny part is that all of this results in a simple 5-1 vote, where Anna is the only one blindsided, and everyone thinks they voted for her for the same reason.

Now bear with me. This isn't the only reason I think this episode is an incredibly complex and beautiful example of survivor gameplay. I also think it's awesome because of how pivotal it is to the fate of the rest of the season. There are so many tiny little things that, if they change slightly, the entire season winds up completely different. If Tai feels unsafe and plays his idol, Peter goes home, and the brains are on the bottom next episode, leading to a brawn and beauty dominated merge and ftc. Either that, or Tai is voted out by Anna, Julia, Aubry, and Joe, completely removing the threat of the super idol and therefore completely changing the character of the postmerge. If the brains do decide to vote for Tai, and he doesn't play his idol, because Scot believed them when they said they would vote Anna, once again the entire postmerge is a completely different story. If Chan Loh loses immunity instead of Gondol, then Michele likely goes home and the winner of the game changes. 

Idk, maybe I'm overthinking this. I just think it's fascinating and a testament to how strong of a season KR is that an episode can have such complex dynamics. Are there any other episodes in other seasons that are like this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I just got done watching Tocantins, and in the reunion show, Jeff makes a point to go out into the audience to talk to Coach's fiancee or girlfriend or something, and she talks about how in Brazil all anyone saw was coach but nobody saw the side she loved, aka Ben Wade.

That was in May 2009. HvV started filming in August of 2009, and in that season, Jerri and Coach have a small romance, and even in the first episode he talks about how she's special because she's not like other women. 

Is it known at all what happened there? Did that lady break up with him in that short three month gap? Was Coach just stepping out on her a la MvGX Taylor? I know this is trivial but I'm really just curious why that changed so suddenly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Forgive me for this rant, but why do the Keating 5 continually take out their anger on Annalise? Annalise has done nothing this entire time but protect them. Wes is the one who got them into the situation in the first place, and yet they all are *soooo* sad that he died, even though they never really did anything but insult him and each other when he was alive. Bonnie is the one that killed Rebecca, although they don't know that, Asher is the one that killed the lawyer lady, Frank is the one that killed Charles Mahoney, Annalise has done *literally nothing wrong.* It just feels like such lazy or stilted writing to constantly have the characters lashing out against Annalise when they have no reason at all to do so. If it weren't for her, they would all be in jail seven times over. So frustrating. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> On recent politics, religion, and this sub. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-30 11:43:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not exactly sure how to begin this post...but recently on this sub I've seen a lot of viewpoints that scare me, and sadden me. And I'm not just referring to fringe comments that are controversial but comments that are largely upvoted and supported.

I think mainly I just want to put out a reminder that we serve Christ, and *only Christ.* We are Christians before Americans. And a lot of people recently have been putting their national interests above their religious ones. We are Christians before we are Republicans or Democrats or any other political party. And I've seen so many people who seemingly are influenced by the common opinion of their party rather than their religion.

As for this sub in particular, I am shocked, and disheartened, at some of the popular notions on here in the past months. I came to this sub from /r/Christianity because I found that that sub didn't hold true to the teachings of the bible. And now it seems that issue is creeping into this sub as well. Many users here have been outspoken in their support for a hateful, narcissistic man who has openly mocked and attacked so, so many people. Is that what Jesus would want of us? I've seen people saying that we need to close our doors to protect our*selves*. Is that what Jesus would want of us? I've seen people calling for the eradication of an entire religion. Is that what Jesus would want of us? 

We need to be honest, but not if we aren't kind. We need to keep our loved ones safe, but not if it means putting our neighbors in danger. We need to spread the word of God, but by taking others on a journey and showing them Christ, not forcing Christianity upon them. 

Although it makes me sad, I don't think I can consider this community home anymore, not if it continues to be led astray as it currently is. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> New series idea [No spoilers] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-12 05:15:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So at first I thought this idea was too out there, but the more I think about it, there's been a ton of ridiculous spiritual bending in both of the Avatar series...I don't know what it would be called, or what the characters would be called, but the first book would be called Time.

The new Avatar is an Earthbender living in reformed-Ba Sing Se in the era after Korra. The world is now much more technologically advanced, and peaceful, to the point where bending isn't really needed anymore nor is the avatar. Bending has actually become like martial arts in our modern world, where people can still train in it, but it is more like a hobby than anything.

The avatar is a high school student (or adult, whatevs), who is constantly made fun of because he was born in the Swamp and raised by "savages", before the Earth Kingdom's largest corporation, led by an earthbender (perhaps a relative of Varrick?), deforested his home and he had to be adopted into the city.

The avatar, in attending a bending lesson one day, is told that he is the avatar, and while excited, doesn't think he will end up using the role for anything major in his life. He soon finds out that the corporation that tore him from his home as a child, now much bigger, is seeking to get rid of what little Swamp lands remain. So, to counter this, he organizes a sit-in (although not a large one, due to his unpopularity), in an attempt to stop them. The spirits of the Swamp and the humans trying to destroy it go to battle, and while the avatar tries to stay out, the instinct to bridge the spirit and mortal worlds kicks in and he enters the avatar state. He wishes he had more time to master bending and stop this, and that he found out sooner he was the avatar and had taken it more seriously. There is a flashback to his childhood, where a descendant of the swamp benders in ATLA remarks how "time is only an illusion". At this moment, with the spirits and corporation benders fighting on either side of him, the world around the avatar suddenly distorts, and before he knows it he wakes up in a strange city, one that looks strangely outdated...

He has timebended, and now he's not only going to have to figure out how to get back home, but learn the secrets behind the corporation he is fighting and the swamp and their roots in history. Plus, at some point there has to be an avatar vs. avatar battle, because that would be awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone else think this game would lend itself to the format of a musical fairly well? One act could be spring and summer, the second could be fall and winter, the main storyline could follow the farmer's efforts to restore the community center and end Joja Corp's tyranny, while also falling in love with one of the residents, and then there could be different subplots revolving around the other residents, like for example George's bitterness from his accident and him dealing with it, Marnie and Mayor Lewis's relationship, Shane's depression, etc. I know this post is pointless I just thought it would be fun to discuss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prepared to get mass downvotes for this, but the way he kept calling everyone else crazy and like they were somehow dumber and less able to play the game as he was came off as condescending to me.

The idea to get out Sunday instead of Bret to keep Adam in the alliance was an *incredibly* smart social/strategic move, she's building moves on her "resume" in a way that doesn't make her a target, and she also wanted David out but didn't make it as obvious as Adam did. I actually think she has a decent shot at winning. ALSO how is she the last girl left?! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-09-13 09:20:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I found a guy on grindr like a week ago (and normally I would be totally against dating a guy on grindr but he has a lot of values and is super compatible with what I'm looking for). We met up and had coffee on Friday, things went really well and I liked being around him, then we went out again on Sunday (but it wasn't really a *date* per se), and then it was his birthday tonight and so we went out again. The fact that he's hung out with me three times in four days makes me think he likes me too, and we've straight up told each other that we like each other a lot. It's just some of the comments he's made have made me think he doesn't really like me in that way (such as saying that maybe we could become friends at some point, talking about how he wants a ltr but not directly relating it to me, etc.)

I guess I'm just wondering, is this normal? I don't have that much dating experience, and the experience I do have moved very fast, to the point where we either slept together within the first couple of meetings or had an instant connection and told each other everything. Is this just how normal dating goes? I feel like we should have at least kissed by now... </TEXT>

It's completely possible to dress well, be hygienic, take care of your body, and still be naturally ugly, and anyone who says otherwise is just trying to make themselves feel like better people for not "judging" people.

Those people will never know it feels to have a conversation ended the minute someone sees your face. Those people will never know how it feels to constantly be rejected because of your physical appearance. Those people will never know how it feels to try everything in your power to be seen as attractive by others and still fail.

I wish I could say that the solution is just having self-confidence and feeling attractive, but sadly, in a society like this one that's largely based on physical appearance, just feeling the part isn't enough. </TEXT>

I don't like complaining about dating/relationship stuff because it sounds so trivial, but without going into too much detail, I've been hurt, betrayed, and lied to by two separate people that I thought I could trust and I thought were the right person for me in the past two months. I'm having an incredibly hard time coping, finding hope, and continuing on with my life. I need all of the strength I can get. </TEXT>
