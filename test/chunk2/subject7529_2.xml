	<TEXT> The sad thing is that they dont seem to know what mord should be. And the REALLY sad thing is that even we dont know It. Being a melee marksman was a cool niche but It got completely ruined, they tried to balance him and now he can be played in every goddam role. I'm sure there is a support mordekaiser OTP somewhere. The lack of consistency in role and builds is (for me) a sign of an identity struggle.

We all want the undead metal as hell juggernaut with necromancers powers, but nobody knows HOW to do It. His most powerful ability (w) makes absolutely no sense for his character fantasy.

Also good shitpost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Upgrade your skills and weapons. Start polishing your party compositions. Also, as quest level rises, stuns become increasingly important. Last but not least, with every new difficulty "jump" New enemies will appear, some of them being really dangerous. It is highly recommended to not try the veteran weald until you have some experience in veteran dungeons. The New veteran weald enemy is... Let's say he can make the tide turn rather quickly. </TEXT>

The party is not that bad if prioritice stuning the back row, also, it is vital that you have some way of clearing corpses for the leper to be able to do something, do you use the PDs smoke grenade? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With the addition of the horrid shrieker, the weald is the only zone with 3 exclusive bosses, and i thought that there is no reason for the cove, weald and ruins to not have an extra boss. Certain events will make a mission available, the mission will only consist of a room with the boss battle. The mission can be aprentice, veteran or champion, depending on your heroes level. You can't get a mission if you don't have a minimum of 4 heroes of that level (or more). 

All the bosses will have a chance of giving unique trinkets and quirks.

The damage and hp values are merely orientative, Hp: a-b-c are for aprentice, veteran and champion

COVE

Event: Dangerous waters

Trigger: 5% chance each week

Effect: Supplies available in shop are reduced by 50%

Duration: The effects will last until the boss is defeated, other events can trigger while the effect is on, but not other "boss events"

Boss: Deep dweller

Appearance: A giant octopus (sorry for my shitty imagination)

Hp:100-150-200

Dodge: 10-15-20

Prot: 0

Resists: High bleed and blight resists, unsurpassable move and stun resist.

Speed: 2

Moves: 2

Size: 2

Type: Beast

Other: Boss will be in ranks 3 and 4, behind a "coral rock", a size 2 enemy with 100% prot and 300% resist to everything

Attacks:

"Tentacle slap" will do moderate 3-5-7 to all ranks, there is a 30% chance he uses "tentacle smash" instead, which does  6-9-12 damage to all ranks. 

The second turn he will always use "tentacle grab" on a hero in rank 1 or 2, it only does 1-2 damage, but "grabs" a hero. The attacks counts as a "move" so it can be resisted. A "grabbed" hero cannot be guarded. The "grabbed" hero does 50% additional damage to the dweller. While a hero is in this state, a tentacle will be on top of the coral, allowing the heroes to damage  the dweller if they attack ranks 1 or 2.

If a hero is grabbed, on the second turn of the next round he will use "devour" on him, doing 20-30-40 damage.

WARRENS

Event: Quick breeding

Trigger: 1% chance per week, will go up by another 1% for each week you don't complete a mission in the warrens.

Effect: There is a chance for swine enemies to appear in other zones together with normal enemies. Including the new "Royal swine guard" enemy. Swinetaur+Unclean giant sounds fun as hell.

Duration: Same as the cove event

Boss: Swine queen

Appearance: An overgrown femenine (ehem) swine. She has grown so big that she cant even stand on her feet so her servants have built her a platform.

Hp: 120-180-240

Dodge: 0

Prot: 0

Resists: High move resist, all other resists are low (even blight)

Speed: -8

Moves: 1

Syze: 1

Type: Human/Beast

Attacks:

"Feeding" heals all of her allies (not her) for 4-7-10 Hp. She will always use it if she has 2 or 3 allies.

"Horrific breeding" deals 5 stress damage to all your party and summon 2 enemies, in any combination of the following:

Swine wretch: Well you know this guy.

Swine worker:

Appearance: A little pig witha big pouch (kangaroo bag)

Hp: 10-15-20

Dodge: 10-20-30

Prot:0

Resists: Same as swine wretch

Speed: 6

Moves: 1

Size: 1

Type: Beast

Attacks:

"Protect the queen" will move the swine queen to the last rank. He will always use this attacks if she is in ranks 1 or 2

"Feed the queen" Heals the queen for 6-9-12 Hp

"Armless bite" Does 4-6-8 damage to one hero. He can only use it from ranks 1 or 2.

Swineling:

Appearance: A fetal swine

Hp: 5-10-15

Dodge: 0-5-10

Prot: 0

Resist: Very low, all of them

Speed: 10

Moves: 1

Size: 1

Type: Beast

Attacks:

"Nourisment" will make him bite one of your heroes, doing 12 stress damage and 3-5-7 damage. It will also buff him with +100% damage. If he manages to use it twice he will heal all of his Hp and transform into a "Royal swine guard".

"Royal swine guard":

Appearance: A big and muscular swine with tick skin and long arms. He also has enormous claws.

Hp: 20-35-50

Dodge: 5-10-15

Prot: 50%

Resists: Same as swine chopper

Speed: 6

Moves: 1

Size: 1

Type: Human/Beast

Attacks:

"Swineslash" does 8-12-16 damage to the rank 1 and 2 heroes, it can also inflict bleed (3-4-5 per turn)

RUINS

Event: Mortal host

Trigger: 1% chance for each week, certain factors can increase this chance, 5% for each hero with a deaths door or deaths door recovery debuff, 10% if you retreat the mission. The chance will be 0% if your party got wiped in the last mission.

Effect: One of the heroes that went in the last quest will be missing, and he/she will permanently die unless you complete the boss quest.

Duration: 1 week.

Boss: Arachne

Appearance: Giant spider (shitty imagination strikes again)

Hp: 50-70-90

Dodge: 10-20-30

Prot: 0

Resists: High blight resist, unsurpassable move resist, rest are lowish.

Speed: 8

Moves: 2

Size: 2

Type: Eldritch/beast

Other: Arachne herself will be in rank 2 and 3, her "legs" will be in ranks 1 and 4

"Legs":

Hp: 20-30-40

Dodge: 10-20-30

Prot: 0

Resists: Unsurpassable move, stun and debuff resist, rest are low.

Speed: 0

Size: 1

Type: Eldritch/beast

Legs dont have actions, but each set of legs permanently buffs arachne with 50 dodge to melee attacks (while they are "alive") and enable some of her attacks. Also, they don't leave a corpe when they "die".

Attacks (Arachne's):

"Stab" does 7-11-15 damage to two heroes, there is a 50% chance she uses this move (can happen twice in a same round), arachne can only use this move while her front legs are "alive".

"Bite" does 4-6-8 damage to a hero in rank 1 or 2. 25% chance. (50% if front legs are dead)

"Spite" does 1-2-3 damage and can inflict blight (1-2-3 damage per turn), can hit any rank. 25% chance. (50% if front legs are dead)

"Steel web", Arachne will always use this attack in the end of the round without needing to spend a turn. This will buff her with a "stunning riposte", where any hero that attacks her can get stunned. She wont use this move if her back legs are "dead".

And thats about it, thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finally did it. After 4 years of torture I found the strenght to step into the abyss. I took my A team; Pd, Vest, Cru, MaA (named after me and my friends) took my finest ancestral trinkets and all the supplies these poor devils could carry.

Our first steps echoed in the timeless chambers that laid in front of us, and we could feel how something ancient was being awakened as we lured deeper into the endless corridors.

Our every effort seamed meaningless against the twisted oposition that grew stronger the deeper we went. Madmen and fanatics, turned into something... more.

And when hope seemed lost and darkness surrounded us with its mortal embrace, we arrived to the old base camp. And there, a living nightmare was awaiting. So strong was it's assault that we couldn't even grasp its true form or nature, which was, in a way, helpfull. We did our best, as we knew that the slightest lapse in concentration would mean death. We were against the ropes, but not defeated, and we finally landed the killing blow, causing the creature to dissolve in a vortex of darkness.

We returned to the hamlet with our prize, and were received with enthusiasm by our companions, a rest, well deserved. Our minds might be shattered by the unspeakable truths we uncovered, and our mission might seem impossible, but victory is one step closer than yesterday, and soon, we will purge this land and return its former glory. </TEXT>

Getting wrecked by the bosses is normal too, work in different comps for each one, for example, for the cauldroombitch you want to Rush her, bring lots of damage on the 3rd and 4th round and ignore the pot. For the rest of the bosses send some random level 0, discover their mechanics and think of effective comps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stun chance makes no sense on the leper. He is a self-reliant juggernaut, with very clearly defined weaknesses and strenghts. He is durable, he does big damages, thats it. The thing is, he does it better than anyone else. Its alright for him to have some form of utility, but only if it helps him complete his task better. Move fulfills this, stun doesn't.

The other buffs sound nice tho </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mercurial scimitar, Mercs, ohmwrecker, ludens, deadmans plate, youmus. Dive them to hell, nothing can stop death. Also, Righteous Glory if for demacian pushovers who care about their team.

Now, seriously, experiment, everyone here has their prefered build and masteries. Half of the time we have no idea of how they work. They just do. Thats why rylai's nerf didn't even bother most of us. We are already dead. The same can be said about mord, they thought they killed him (in the lore and in the balance team), but he just keeps coming back. You can't kill what its already dead. You can't nerf what is already nerfed.

Whe dont care about balance changes because we are already completely unviable. But somehow we rise again. And we will, for all eternity. Hue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you having problems with champion dungeons as a whole, or is It just the New enemies that give you problems?

The first case its probably a typical case of bad compositions/strategy.

If not... Welp, you gotta Focus the fuckers. I have had no problems at all with the bone bearer and the squiffy ghast. 

For the first I simply oneshot him with my rank 1 jester (I always take one to the ruins because of the stress), and MaA if he somehow survives.

For the ghast... MaA is all you need, Rampart renders him almost useless. If I get him together with a thrall I focus the thrall with my crusader smite (he is unholy), then I focus the ghast (he is unholy too).

The hatefull Virago just needs to get hit once by my occ or arbakesters Mark and she gets easily focuses down.

Havent met the skiber yet, but I always take heavy move/stun comps for the swinetaurs, It should be fine. </TEXT>

Try rushing SV, It should help, also Mercs are mandatory.

First levels you gotta be agressive, stack that passive up and she won't have enough damage to break through, and always pressure her when her e is down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does, but theres no real reasons to use It. Once your heroes get to resolve lv 6 the chances of getting the bleed are too low to reallistically consider them. In the meantime... Meh, its pretty manageable in aprentice and veteran dungeons. </TEXT>
