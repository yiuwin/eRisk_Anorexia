	<TEXT> I agree, stupid name that is only going to confuse would-be MPT users. Might attract some people, thanks to the "DMT" in the name, but anybody worth his salt is going to understand MPT is a DMT-analog anaway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't say that. Very much worth buying if you are looking for something that won't quite catapult you into another world like DPT or DALT, but that actually has some oompf to it unlike EPT or MET. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MORE POTENT THAN DALT?!? DALT is practically DMT, in my experience! Use a torch and a freebase rig with about 70mg. Duration is about 15 minutes. 

Now MALT is one that I am curious about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MPT. I just wrote a report about it last night, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/63cgjz/mpt_experiment_47mg_vaped/).

	<TEXT> I would recommend starting with MPT, actually. It feels similar in terms of hallucinations, but much milder and gentler. DPT is a soul-launching substance and must not be taken lightly, as my [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/63d74i/dpt_37mg_smoked_trip_report/) indicates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I couldn't bring myself to stay in a single place for too long. It was too horrifying, what with those raccoon eyes hovering all about me and the sense of walking through the living primaeval graveyard.  </TEXT>
