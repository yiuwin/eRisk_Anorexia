	<TEXT> As i said before, i think Serpico, Farnese, and Azan's voices were fine. I'm only on episode three of the dub so far, but its quite clear to me that the voice actor for Guts was trying very hard to sound as close to Marc Diraison's voice in the other adaptations as he could. I think there is a real chance that for the dub of the second season, they might indeed get Marc to return. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Netflix is Taking an Interest in Live Action Adaptations of Anime, Could Berserk Be Next? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-24 07:08:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So for those of you who haven't heard, Netfilx has purchased the distribution rights to a live action film version of the Death Note anime. Netflix has shown interest in Berserk in the past, having had the three Berserk films on its streaming service (i think the first one still is up there). Its concievable to think that Netflix might be interested in pursuing some type of live action version of Berserk, whether it be a series or a film. What do you all think? A year or so ago, someone posted a series of storyboard type threads with shots from other films that proved that a live adaptation of at least the golden age parts of the story should be filmable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with your analysis regarding the foreshadowing, but once Guts and Co. leaves the island and returns to the mainland, it seems that there will be little left plotwise for Roderick if he is not Farnese's fiance. Thus i think its likely that he will be killed off in the event that she rejects him (which i think is highly likely once they no longer have any use of his ship). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No you have it backwards, if you lose an appeal, then you file a counter notification to the DCMA complaint. Unless the copyright holder files a lawsuit against you, your video will be restored as well as your channel if it was suspended. Its not you who has to file the suit, its the copyright holder. But, you better be damned sure that you comply with the four prong test, because if your not and they do decide to sue, you now can be found liable for  copyright infringement ontop of anything youtube might do to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its not my thinking, its federal case law. If you are using literally 1 second of footage in the manner i described above, and issue a counter-notification to a takedown notice, any smart corporate attorney would stop there and take no further action. There is a four prong test to determining fair use: Purpose and Character of Use, Nature of the Copyrighted Work, Amount and Substantiality, and Effect Upon Work's Value. So long as the original source from which the 1 second of footage is at least a couple minutes long, such use as i previously described is literally the very core of the fair use doctrine. Note that we are talking about video footage here, case law has practically eliminated or severly restricted most utilizations of the fair use doctrine for music recordings outside of parody.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, if someone literally used one second of copyrighted footage, and then spent five minutes providing technical analysis of what occured in that one second of footage, it would mostl likely fall under fair use. Thats literally why fair use exists. Extremely small pieces of copyrighted footage can be used under fair use, so long as its for criticism, news reporting, teaching, or research. Longer pieces of copyrighted footage can generally only fall under fair use if its for the purpose of parody. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It could make sense if the soldiers guessed that Serpico was a bastard of Farnese's father, it was actually quite common in medival europe for nobles and kings to keep their bastard children in there service as military officials and the like, even in instances where they did not acknowledge paternity of such children publicly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually think Azan sounds spot on, a gruff sort of voice, fairly close to what i imagined it would be. Farnese sounds fine to me too. I did notice that they had the voice actor for Guts try to sound close to Marc Diraison's voice in the previous Berserk adaptations. As such it makes me wonder if they will try to get Marc for the dub of the second season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would wager that they did in fact contact Marc Diraison, but that his availability was such that there would have been a delay in production. The distributors probably wanted fast cash flow out of what they no doubt have already paid liscensing fees for, and thus pushed to have the project completed no later than the debut of season two of the new Berserk anime so as to ride the wave of that seasons release. If that is the real way it went down, i can understand the thinking behind that, but i still think it was a major mistake in the long run because it turns longtime fans away from product and discourages them from recommending it to people who havent necessarily been exposed to Berserk before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> North Korea recently tested a high thrust engine and has stated that it is in the final stages of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile. Experts believe that given the recent flurry of missile tests that a test of a North Korean ICBM that could possibly hit the United States mailand is likely to occur soon. This is alarming considering the increasing tensions between North Korean and the United States, and the current American government's statement that it would not allow North Korea to develop such a weapon. </TEXT>
