	<TEXT> He is a HUGE part of our history. It was a sad departure and happened at a pretty bad time for us. But I will always love his work ethic and determination as a player. Guy has heart and he ISN'T a selfish player at all. It was a tough decision for him i'm sure... but he needed to be closer to family. There will always be salty tampa fans... but in my personal opinion, if you didn't watch him as he hoisted the cup and then stuck with the team through many piss poor years (playing damn well), you probably aren't a clear headed fan of the team... </TEXT>
