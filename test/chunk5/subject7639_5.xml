	<TEXT> Now with the new DLC, more torture options seem fine. At the end of the intrigue focus, you get an option to choose master schemer or impaler. Impaler doesn't seem to have anything specific or any bonuses at all, compared to Master Schemer. Can anybody explain me about this ? What's impaler about ? Master Schemer seems to be the no brainer choice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the problem is not only that, but even if you achieve total naval superiority, you can't just knock them out in 6 months. There is no blockade. They can just spam convoys with all their dockyards and keep getting their stuff, and there's nothing you can do about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good luck producing enough SP-art for all of your infantry by 1940, which Germany will invade you if you are playing a decent country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. SP-Art is for your mobile divisions. Use line artillery for your infantry </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Encircle. I have troubles taking on the soviets without mobile warfare because I can't encircle them.

And yeah you have to stay at peace till 39 for mobile warfare to work, so you can prepare your tanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, even if sinking enemy convoys actually hurts them, you can't seem to find enough convoys without radar support. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 4 Tank 3 mot 2 Sp-art is a really good combo for breakthroughs. I also tend to use 4-5 SP-art and 2 mot divisions to breakthrough but I don't build a lot of them. 7-2 is good for infantry. 4-4 is also good as a artillery-breakthrough division. It should have near 300 soft attack, but still SP-art divisions are just better, as they have near 500 soft attack.


Hard attack is useless though, always keep that in mind. </TEXT>
