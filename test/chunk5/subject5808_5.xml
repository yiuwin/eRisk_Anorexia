	<TEXT> Alrighty, now you're speaking my language. (This all depends if these places are open)

Start off down at the Royal Derby Hotel (Not the top end of Brunswick Street as you might think). You'll get a chance to soak up some of the cricket and some bevvos in one of Melbourne's most beloved sports bars

From there head up for a drink at Polly depending if they're open. Be careful though, no windows makes it easily deceptive to let the day get on, they mostly specialize in cocktails but have some cool decor and furniture

Little bit of a hike to our next pub, but she's worth it, the Evelyn Hotel has a great outdoor area out the front where you can sit and lap up the sun and drink some beers on Brunswick Street

From here things get a bit hectic, 4 pubs within 100 metres of eachother, I won't go into details but Bar Open has a sick beer garden, The Provincial has a great tap and spirit collection, the Stone Hotel is the new kid on the block but has a nice vibe and then The Old Bar (Just down Johnston St a little) is a great Rock N Roll Pub

From here you continue back to Brunswick Street and head towards the city. If you're in the mood for Cocktails, Naked for Satan will have you covered.

Then from there you'll find the Rooks Return, a great small spot with good beers on tap. Then the Labour in Vain is practically next door and another real Rock inspired pub with some nice taps and depending on the day, they usually have a band jamming in the front bar.

Then from there I'd recommend The Worker's Club, you'll be feeling bloody fresh by the end of all of this and the Worker's, considering it's Monday, will have $2 pots, $4 pints and $8 jugs to finish you off completely!

Enjoy!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People who were around before Sing the Sorrow tend to think it's a sellout album because of the musical shift and popularity that came with Decemberunderground.

But if you see the natural curve of how popular AFI became album after album from the start it made sense they were going to be all over MTV and Radio at some stage. Then Crash Love came and everyone who was around before went "This is what we were expecting after Sing the Sorrow" meanwhile everyone who came on board during the Decemberunderground album were like "This is crap, we wanted another album exactly the same" and the bands popularity quickly dissipated among that group of fans

---
Please also be advised that I'm just a bystander in all of this, but I wouldn't rate DU very highly in my picks of albums, it's just that it doesn't speak to the AFI I got to know... and that's okay. It earned them a lot of fans and respect from the wider community, which isn't bad at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a musician. I play in a band and this year we've played nearly 40 shows, with the 40th being on New Years Eve. The amount of time and money I've spent on equipment, transport, touring, merchandise, recording and releasing our music is enough to have a really nice car or a downpayment on a house. 

But I love it, and that feeling I get when people are singing along with me, drinking, dancing and having a great time to songs I've written... There's no better feeling in the world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My interpretation. 

---
It's sung from a perspective of someone offering drugs for most of the song. "Everyone takes flight never to return again" meaning that you're always chasing the urge to get high once you take off. The person the lyricist is singing to is trying to refuse but eventually gives in and their colour changes from Black/Red to White and they come around. 

TL:DR - Davey is a drug dealer </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tonight I'm doing sound for the Collarts end of year function. The band is playing til Midnight so it will be a late finish, fortunately for me though it's 24 hour transport so I won't need to Uber Home. 

Tomorrow I'll be up early to go film a couple of Keggin skits with my drummer, then I'll be heading to Old Bar in the afternoon for a couple of drinks and some tunes

Sunday morning I'm going to go visit my sister in Ballarat and then going to be surprising my Mum for lunch in Rochester as I'm not going to be home for Christmas. Then I'm getting the 4:30 V-Line train back to Melbourne and collapsing.
