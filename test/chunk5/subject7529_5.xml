Buildings:

Stage coachGuild=ArmorySanytoriumOthers

Why? You can benefit from the Stage coach without any aditional investment, every other building will requiere you to spend gold. Guild and Armory are the only ones which improve your heroes combar efficiency. Sanytorium sort of does it too, but to a lesser extent, good team management will allow you to avoid most negative quirks.

Experiment with all of the characters, all of them are usefull in some way or another, some are good in almost every situation (MaA, Houndmaster...) while others are super powerfull in their niches (Leper).

Stress, stress, stress, learn to manage stress by focushing the main threats.

Try some yolo compositions every now and then, in most cases it will end in disaster but will be a fun experience, Rank 2 vestal is a good example.

Only invest gold in your heroes if: you are in desperate need of that class, they have really good quirks you want, they are lv 3 or higher. If they have high stress and you don't plan investing any gold on them just kick them out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, this looks so much better, life, culling strike... The thing is, with so many uniques, how do you plan to reach the elemental resist cap? If the answer is endurance charges then its a big no no, later or sooner you will get bursted before you can get them, also x2 mings hearth is really going to hurt your hp, I'd take 2 rares to help cap resist, even at the cost of all the damage and the chaos resist. And I insist that kingsguard would be a better option. Last thing, the leech nodes you have taken in the tree are not the best ones here, you want Hemathophagy, which will increase your max leech rate, because Berserker has enough %damage leeched anyways. </TEXT>

The referent for most of us is TastyPotatox Twitch stream, he plays Mordekaiser adc with a Blitzcrank premade, most of his games are: Get poked under tower for 8 mins, both junglers gank, blitz lands a nasty hook, triple kill, get tower with the ghost, get dragon with the ghost, chain that with a tower, get another tower, drink enemy team tears, profit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> -Can be anything you want: Full yolo ap, burster, dps ap to "oneshot" with ult. Ap bruiser, ad bruiser, tank, auramancer...

-Most metal, numero 1 champ in the game.

-His winrate is surprisingly good after 50 or so games, around 55% overall (I think I have like 60% but im just in gold), and in my personal experience it can go bonkers If you have a premade helping you, as you can coordinate to get ghosts a lot heasier.

-Did I mention he is metal as fuck?

-Mechanically speaking he is surprisingly hard. (*Da fuck is this guy saying?*). First, super low mobility and no cc give you very few tools to outplay your oponent, you'll have to learn to make them fight with you and to bait people.

 He has lots of bugs, which have a significant effect in your results, youll need to learn to avoid them or benefit If you can (jhins 4th bullet).

Third, Ghost micromanagement is hard as fuck, as It basically requieres you to play two games at the same time, wonky AI makes this even worse.

He is very reliant on snowball, and he has to rotate with his ghosts to get as many objectives as he can.

The good thing here is that he doesn't have too many bad match ups (in top), so snowballing is not that hard.

Can be pretty good if you know what you are doing, for starters top is more recommended.  In mid he hard counters most Assassins, and against ranged he can push fast and then do raptors to get fed simply by farming, his kill pressure is low in this match ups, tho.

-Wait until you get your first 4th shot jhin Ghost, most satisfying feeling in the game.

-Also metal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whit that winrate you won't have much room for improvement until you start playing against better players who punish you more. I'd say that you die a bit too often (yes, you get more kills, but still) and that suggests me that you may lack some map awareness, which is super important on mord as he is 100% reliant on good rotations with his ghosts to win in higher levels of play.

Other than that... Dunno, builds seem fine, the only thing would be to gain knowledge on some though matchups (Ask If you want) and maybe changing your name to Metalmancer or something like that, Legends say It Increases your winrate by 50% </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Her... I'm counting 7 items: Lyandries+Steraks+rylai+deadmans+visage+rabadons+boots.

Is the plan to change boots for rabadons in the lategame? Because that wouldnt be advisable, Mord NEEDS every tiny bit of mobility he can get, and rabadons won't be that efficient with such a low ap.

Grasp of the undying is pretty meh on Mordekaiser because of his low base Hp, even going full tank, try Deathfire Touch instead, or SRS of course.

Lyandries+Frozen hearth is a neat combo. The attack speed slow will trigger the Lyandries double damage, and the cdr and armor are great on mord.

Steraks, deadmans and visage are great on morde overall. Rylai's is more situational If you are going full bruiser, If your team has enough cc It can be valuable to fit a zonias or something in there, an abysall would be fine too.

Runes are fine, I prefer ap quints, but Magic pen is fine. </TEXT>

-There is no reason not to take oak in standard, also, the 8% attack speed from caitryn on cruel is close to useless.

-You missed two of the best keystones in the game, the one that avoids stuns (super valueble) that negates your evasion chance (irrelevant because you convert all evasin into armor) and the one that Increased your hit chance to 100% but negates your crit chance (irrelevant too), with this accuracy, your hit chance in lategame would be close to 80%, so a  100% will increase your effective dps by 25% </TEXT>

Yes, I know you can do something very similar using the secret freefall tunnel, but that wasn't the point, I simply wanted to mess with the level design and see how far in could be pushed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! Another neeb here! I'm personally doing a completely blind run but I can understand people who aren't ready to deal with how frustrating this game can get.

Some "tricks" that have helped me inmensely so far are getting the "green shield" or whatever its name is. Its between the Darkroot Forest and the Darkroot Bassin, guarded by a Black Knight and makes Increased your stamina regen a lot if you equip It. You can also get the ring of favor by killing the golden armor guy you rescue from the undead parish (its a though fight tho), It Increased your health, stamina and allowed weight but will break If you unequip It (which I dont think I'll ever do because of how strong It is).

Remember to control your weight to quick roll, and practice parries, as they are invaluable to fight humanoid enemies and make some though fights a breeze (Black Knight for example) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can understand their appeal, but I hate how the make their societies too simplistic. If the world is under a dictatorship you aren't going to change It with a shallow speech about freedom and shotting some "bad guys", who are also citizens who are being opressed by the system but hey, our badass protagonist is completely justified to kill them all in the name of "freedom".

"The hunger games" for example tried to tackle this in an interesting way, by showing how overthrowing and opressive regime, will more often than not result in a worse system, in a different way, but It felt rushed, because the books where too focushed on showing Catniss shoot at things and solve her romantic triangle. And the ending... What is the point of the ending? We fought for freedom but we only killed thousand of people, now I suffer PTS and we barely changed anything, so, dont fight for freedom? What was the point of the trilogy? That there is no way to change society? There is, but shotting is far from being close to the collective effort that is required. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The humanoids by Jack Williamson. The ending solves every single problem humanity has and shows a future of scientific progress and a new era of wellbeing, and its absolutely terrifying for it, one of those books that I consider everyone should read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I know, but I wanted to try a more defensive setup, onslaught gives you tons of evasion, so I thought itll ge the job done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the fast answer!

I am aware of too much movement speed being a problem, I have tried some cyclone rf builds and It has similar problems, but in my exoerience, proper cyclone control solves this.

I'm planing to take those nodes, but I wasn't sure if they would be enough to Sustain the cyclone, you have to consider that with this cracy levels of movement speed, you are activating the skill a lot more, which makes the man cost go bonkers, I'll have to test this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sup, not a malz main but I paky him every now and then. For what I have heard, most players struggle in high gold/Low plat because they still try to play malz as a burst champion that 100-0s people, most of them are far more succesfull with more dps oriented builds (rylais+lyandris into voidstaff). You will also need to adjust your playstyle, not just your build, but its definitely  possible to reach higher ranks with malzi. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dont think that a book being written by a douchebag makes the reading any worse. Yes, Ayn Rand is... Well, Ayn Rand, no need to go into details, but as long as she focuses on architecture and doesn't let her bias leak I dont see any problem. I profoundly respect Orson Scott Card as a writer, even though he had some ideas I strongly diverge with.

The thing is, what does the book do to describe architecture? Does It explain how the structure and materiales make the building not only functional, but also artistic?

Now that you mention architecture, "The pillars of the Earth", by Ken Follet comes to mind, the scenes of Tom imagining the church, the importance and symbolism of the cross shape, the entrance and windows is my favourite part of the book. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Theorycrafting a low-budget cyclone raider, advice? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone! I am planing to play a cyclone raider as my next build (standard league, maybe hardcore), I can't post the tree because im dumb, but they idea is to use phasing and onslaught to get evasion, dodge, movement and attack speed, also the elemental ailment inmunity is really nice.

I can get 200inc life from the tree and tons of evasion rating, around 200% Increased attack speed and 350-400% Increased damage (if i can get a couple decent jewels) Weapon will be 2 allures for the extra movement speed (both should stack) and decent damage. I know that claws small range is a drawback, but +range jewels and the insane movement speed (150% increase) should make clearspeed decent.

My evasin should be around 20k before Grace, (which im not 100% sure I'll take, but most probably yes) so I plan to take a Queen of the Forest (I have a 5 link, which is more than enough for me).

I'll probably fit a warlords Mark to Sustain mana and power a Inmortal call. I dont plan to use any charges other than this.

Any advice? Has anyone tried something similar? Does It sound as harcore viable? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand what you are trying to do and respect It, but I fear that Dark Souls might not be the best game to randomice. Without having much experience, I can tell that enemy location is a vital part of the level design. Think of the spear guy under the red dragon in undead burg, he is much more dangerous that other of his kin because the wall limits your movelpool and the cliff prevents you from dodging or backstabbing.

Think of the Black knights, who are always guarding paths that lead to strong equipment but are optional (in the begining) and how much of a struggle in would be to face a Black Knight as the first enemy after firelink shrine. Yes, It is definitely doable, but... Dunno, Im not sure about this. Good luck with it anyways! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would like to open a discussion about, well, books that analyce music, cinema, sports... And how they inspire or hurt people.

Any book that makes a central point the description of something from another medium will do, granted that its a plot or character driven story which also talks about these themes, so more informative books like "1000 movies you should watch" are excluded. For reference, books like "Songmaster", by Orson Scott Card or "The perfume" by Patrick Suskind should be interesting to discuss. Poetry books are fine too.

Why do you read these books instead of listening to music or watching a film? Can they truly grasp the essence of the craft they describe? Is it possible to "listen" to a book rather than "reading" It? </TEXT>
