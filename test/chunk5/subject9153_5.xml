	<TEXT> You're falling into the same pit as Tumblr if you want some kind of "safe space" then.

If you know feminism isn't bad, try to convince people. But even if you fail, give them a break, you DO know there are quite a lot of crazies who ruin it for the rest, tough luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is quite possibly the best subreddit, you should check it out.

Have you ever been on the cringe channel? This is very similar, but instead cringing only at tumblr posts. 

If you ever wonder why people think tumblr is crazy, this is the reason. Not that all the website is shit, but it's usually filled with people sharing a toxic mindset. 

For example, they believe in "black face" or something, if a girl tries to paint her face to cosplay a brown or black princess, they go hunt her down. That kind of mindset. 

TumblrInAction is also very funny, even if I sound serious about it. Don't get me wrong, things like insulting a poor cosplayer because she tried to look like a black princess are not funny at all, that was just shitty.
 
But sometimes they do far less harmless stuff and you can just laugh at how uppity they are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is unfair to hate on GenderCritical tho.

They are feminists who fight WOMEN's problems, as in, the shit women have to deal with since the moment they were born.

If I was a girl, I sure as hell wouldn't want to be in the same movement and fight for some guy (because they were raised as guys) who suddenly calls himself a woman.

You can argue all you want, but that dude wasn't exactly stare-raped, nor the object of desire of an entire classroom, and much less catcalled. He was seen as a man, but in his head he's a woman. It doesn't matter what he believed tho, in real life his position was that of a man.

Transexuals have their problems, and GenderCriticals AKNOWLEDGES that even if some of them aren't bad, trans problems aren't feminist problems, just like racism isn't. 

And they even shared some good stories there, that you apparently fail to read. 

Besides, wax is not wax because of its shape, as that can change. It simply is wax, just like a man is a man. Girls have every right to be terrified of those "lesbian" trans who haven't even transitioned. It's the same as me putting on a skirt right now and asking them to let me be near them. "Oh girls, excuse my silly lesbian boner" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They should lower their standards.

They're just making the world a worse place by having an unrealistic image of themselves and also unrealistic expectations about the men they want.

I just want someone to look at without cringing, and some shared interests. Not that different from a friend, but it has to be attractive.

Now, womyn will just take a shitton of things in consideration. True equality hasn't been achieved yet, and I'm waiting for it.

And no, you may say that you're also a picky man, but 7 times out of 10, that boring lookin' nerd guy will be totally wanting that borin girl who plays Mario.... while more often than not, she'd only accept him if he has "potential" to be succesful.

I mean, what the fuck, who thinks about that. Well, a lot of gals do. 

But try to tell them to lower those standards in public and you get an GIGANTIC backlash and a lot of "you go gurl, do whatever you want!" "lol he's probably a loser" "Women can do whatever they want!"

And yes, technically they can do whatever they want... but that's something to change for future generations, in an ideal world where both male and female are truly equals, they shouldn't be expecting to gain anything material from us, just like I don't expect my girlfriend to gift me a playstation or buy me food. </TEXT>

We pretty much know as a fact, his punches are the fastest thing in the entire series.

And no human can take hipersonic punches from a giant buddha. He was a hax character in his universe, I believe people would get squashed even with just 1 hit, and he gives thousands of them.

Pretty simple ability, but he needs no more.

It's literally "I kill you godspeed with no strategy needed"

Who knows, maybe Ging has some pretty hax power able to suck someone else's soul if they met certain conditions, but Netero needs no setup, destroys anyone in the blink of an eye. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, here's the fuss. We are already 20 and we live in different cities, we only talk by Facebook and Skype. So, I stopped talking to her for the past year when she revealed she was very close to her boyfriend after a brief fight we had.

She started gloating about telling him about everything that happened on her day, that included talking about me and other friends. 

I was already with another girl and she knew it, and I knew she was with another guy, but we decided to not talk about them.

Her telling me that she talked about everything with him had some nasty implications, I wouldn't want to know that our personal conversations are being shared, so I blocked her. 

For the past months I decided to investigate her boyfriend and holy fuck. Basically, he was a dude into his 25's who started dating her while she was 15.

She doesn't have a father and has to take care of her brothers so I've concluded she has daddy issues and would look up to someone much older than her.

I've decided to talk to her again and confirmed it. Her real life friends stopped talking to her whenever they got to know about him and her mother never agreed but she couldn't do much to stop him. 

So this girl stopped telling people about her boyfriend, and because of it, on these 5 fucking years, nobody has really helped her telling her "what the hell are you doing".

I pretty much told her that but since it was our very first conversation, I didn't manage to go very deep into her mind. She only said she was thinking about it, but since then hasn't done anything, she still likes his memes and keeps talking to him by inbox.

Anything I should know to convince her that even if she is legal now, it was AND is a pretty fucked up thing to be with an old man? Dude's not even rich or handsome, while she is pretty easy on the eye and a has a lot of good things.

He pretty much told her she was too mature for her age and gave her the attention she wanted, but you've got to have some REALLY LOW moral to even get attracted to a little girl. I'm 20 and see 15 yrs old girls as little sisters, that dude was 25 goddammit.

You know, I don't even know if I'm requesting help, but I needed to say that. Still, if you want to say anything, I'll read it. She has everything going for her and is only making some loser happy. </TEXT>

But it is still seen as a taboo to even suggest it.

These kind of people are so full of themselves, deluded into thinking this is [The right thing] to do... that is really sad. 

If an experiment to create life came out wrong and we ended up with one deformed mass of flesh trying to drool and mentally not being in this world, one would think it is only human to put it down, right?

Well, apparently this people would be fine keeping it alive to earn imaginary points, since there are some cases already discussed right here when some people barely even classify as humans.

His leader skill isn't impressive, doesn't link with good units and the important one, doesn't have anything unique.

	<TEXT> Guise guise guise... dont let the hype die. Remember how before Gogeta we had +2 Ki for all and Monotypes were viable since it was 3?

Right now 3 ki became obsolete because of Gogeta, so the new generation of TUR leaders MAKES viable monotypes again. 

3 KI and a massive boost. If you have enough good units, that leader skill will make you everyone on your team SS rank. Much stronger than a rainbow team with Gogeta lead.

If you have ever used a Kid Buu leader you should understand how broken it is to have that along 3 ki and 70% atk   def.

Gogeta will be the balanced choice and these TURs will be the MAXIMUM POWER option. That until SS4 Gogeta arrives with this same leader skill for all types  </TEXT>

Read again that big reply from HumaAbedin.

They came out of nowhere to change quite a LOT of iconic heroes into minorities. That ain't subtle nor organical. That's not including new characters so some people can relate, that's throwing them at us like bricks. 

At this rate I can see them not having a single white straight male by 2020. They'll think they did a good thing but they just inverted racism.  </TEXT>

Yeah he can hate Muslims, you said it, it's not like he can deport all of them. BUT he can prevent them from getting in. He's got his reasons by watching how well everything's going on in Europe.

Also he's not against mexicans legally coming in. But those trying to "jump the wall" should be met HARSHLY. Maybe he doesn't build an actual wall but instead displays an army to hunt down people trying to illegaly get in.


Presidents aren't Emperors so he won't be able to do as he pleases, but I have faith that he'll make the country better even if just a little. That's better than nothing, like the other candidates.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just for LR Goku, not taking into account the TUR farm. To get 777 medals...

We'd need to WIN 111 times. At 50 stamina that'd be 2 times in the morning (unless you have 150 but that's uncommon) then waiting to refill till' night. Say, 8 times each weekend. 111/8=13.875.... 13 weekends is the minimum of time (without refilling) to get LR Goku. 

Assuming everything just goes as planned and you get to always play and win. And you'd need to do it again to max him. 

Even though he is "Free", you need to go full whale to get him while he's still relevant. Playing without refilling will take at least 4 months and by then he won't be the strongest.

Don't despair tho, it will still help to one day get him to link with new LRs, Gogeta has been out for 6 months already and people without him would still be glad to suddenly get him.

But yeah this isn't free at all unless you're planning on playing long-term, you'll eventually farm him. If his stage gave at least current Super stages with x3 XP it would be good.   </TEXT>
