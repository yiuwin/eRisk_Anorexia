	<TITLE> Help with a software installation.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok so I recently downloaded a pirated version of "Addictive Drums." It got a ton of good review on the site, so I figured it would work. But now when I try to install it, I just get told that there's an older version of the software that I need to delete. Even though I already unistalled the previous version. If I let it do it automatically it just tells me that it can't find "C:/ Program Files (X86), LN Audio, Addictive Drums, Uninstal 
.log

Can anyone help me with this, or at least direct me to a subreddit that can? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Artist: Hollerado | Album: Record In A Bag | These guys are awesome, they actually sold the album is a plastic bag filled with confetti, they're not super obscure up here in Canada but I don't know about down south, sorry if they're pretty well known. 

Artist: Joel Plaskett | Album: Scrappy Happiness | I saw him live and he's just full of energy, he even has little dancing mechanical monkeys hooked up to a guitar pedal on stage. (Frank Turner opened for him, you should check him out too!) Every single song on this album was released one at a time, once a week, I thought that was pretty cool.

Artist: Hippie Campfire | Album: Hippie Campfire | An awesome local act, they sound a lot like RHCP but lean a little bit more towards the funk side, they're on iTunes too! My personal favourite songs by them are "Heart of the Lamb" and "Mr. Bigshot."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So a while ago I somehow managed to delete my Administrator account on my Acer Windows 7 laptop. Now I have absolutely NO admin privileges, I can't create accounts, install anything, etc. I've aready tried "net user administrator /active:yes" and I've also tried adding it from the command line but I always get "Error Code 5, Access Denied" is there any other way I can solve this problem?   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>    So I know Reddit absolutely hates one direction but I really like Niall (the blonde one's) outfit in [this](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347000391226/One-Direction-at-the-MTV--010.jpg) picture.

Anyone have any idea where I can get a similar outfit (the pants, sweater, and undershirt) on a relatively small budget? I'm new here, by the way.

	<TEXT> So long story short, some asshole has been hitting on my girlfriend. And he starts commenting on one of my pictures on facebook, calling me gay (cause being a homophobe is so damn funny) and come up with something witty to say and then one of his friends, who everyone I know seems to love, comments too, saying that my family's stupid because they're British (i don't even know) and whatnot. And then I message him telling him to stop and that he's being an idiot. And he just replies "at least I didn't try to kill myself." mind you, this happened a long time ago, but everyone still seems to remember it. 

What he said has left me thinking that no one likes me, and that everyone thinks that my suicide attempt was funny or something. I'm not in a good state of mind right now, guys, I feel like cutting. I just don't know what to do, is there any way I can deal with this guy? 

I just realized this is kind of long, sorry... </TEXT>
