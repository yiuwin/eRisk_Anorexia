	<TEXT> Hey again, i posted a few days ago about a new job i got, and something has just been pointed out to me, i work at a pub, two days a week atm, and for example the weekend just gone fri-sat i was scheduled to do 10:30 hours over the two days, we closed an hour early on friday and i had to clock out, missing out on 1 hours wage, the same happened on saturday, but had to clock out 30minutes early, again missing out on 30min pay, is there anything i can do about this or is it legal? considering it costs me over an hours wage to get to work and back home, it's kind of frustrating to missing out on quite a bit of money

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-3348869/Doctor-wife-sentenced-keeping-slave-24-years.html "Although their mistreatment of Mr Inuk spanned 24 years, illegal servitude only became an offence under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 so they were convicted and sentenced for their actions only between 2010 and 2013. However, Judge Arran said he considered the total length of time Mr Inuk suffered as an aggravating feature." there was another post on reddit a while ago with the same kind of thing, it was also mentioned on QI, and i did about 6-7 years of Public services in school/college and this came up alot when talking about laws etc </TEXT>
