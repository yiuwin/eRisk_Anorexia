	<TEXT> Abusers aren't always sketchy looking. Nor are they always in low paying jobs. They can be police officers, paramedics, lawyers, doctors, anyone. You can't tell an abuser by their outward appearance. 

My abuser is a paramedic working on his Masters. He is also abusive in every way you can think of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for saying this. I was in an abusive relationship and his main thing was emotional abuse. If I told people, they brushed it off as him having a bad day. It escalated very quickly. When it got physical, that's when people started to believe me. When he left me, I'd been so brainwashed that I was convinced everything was my fault. I was so insecure and so empty because he kept telling me I wasn't worth loving, no one would love me like he did, etc. Eventually,  you just take it as fact and you are grateful they "love" you. It's been two years since he left me. I am only just starting to deal with him in therapy.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [rant][support] Unqualified and Annoying </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I got a job interview lined up today at a daycare. it's part time, but that's 20 hours a week I'm out of the house. I told Nmom about it and Nsister chimes in and says something along the lines of:

"you're unqualified. you've never had a job. I've been working since I was 16. you've only had one interview. no one will hire you."

I went quiet and Nsister starts talking about the pet sitting jobs she has lined up and how much overtime she gets. it felt like a slap in the face to me. I was in treatment for anorexia when i was 16 and 17. I couldn't work, I was too sick. 

the conversation changed and I tried to contribute. Nsister then said the way I spoke was annoying and started to mock me. Nmom joined in with her. I have a stutter when I get stressed out and I've been very stressed out. I also have a slur due to numbness from some neurological issues that gets worse with stress. it just hurts when they makes fun of something I can't help. I should know by now that Nmom won't defend me, but I still hope she does one day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess this is kind of an exception, but I American and in my high school we had the option to take AP classes. I took Human Geography, World History, and European History. We covered so much about WW2 that I never knew about until my high school career. My teacher had lived in Japan, Eastern Europe, and taught in Western Europe and he wanted us to be educated on the things people tend to gloss over. This was definitely not the norm, though. In regular or honors classes they really only discussed the version of WW2 that gets chewed up and spit out to most US students.

Anyways, just my two cents here. I find this thread so interesting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The other day, Nmom was telling me that she found a spider in her pant leg. I guess she wanted me to know how it felt because she then starts poking my leg where the spider was on her leg. I asked her to stop once and she kept doing it while holding me down. I have really bad anxiety about being touched and she knows this, yet kept doing it. When I finally got away, she seemed really hurt and said that she was only trying to play with me. 

This kind of stuff is a regular thing in my Nfamily. I'm sitting in a chair? Nsister comes and sits on me. I'm helping cook dinner? Ndad comes up behind me to scares me. I was just curious if this is an N thing. Maybe asserting dominance? Making sure the maintain control? I don't know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> how do you think we can deal with the mountains of trash in the ocean? in my marine science class, we were discussing nurdles and how many products we use daily have them in their ingredients. our wildlife is suffering and our ecosystem is in turmoil. oceanic pollution doesn't seem to be talked about as much as it should. I feel.like the damage done isn't reversible, but it can be controlled of we do something.  </TEXT>
