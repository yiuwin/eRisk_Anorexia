	<TEXT> Me: The clean slate? Where you type in someone's name, date of birth and in a few minutes the record of every porn site they visited to is gone from the face of the Earth? Sound a little to good to be true?

Eddy_j5: Your lying! NoFap Data took it to prototype stage.

Me: That's why I bought them. But they had nothing. It was a gangbang myth.

	<TEXT> Okay, mathematical variable explanations don't work. Let me explain:

The thing is people can be great, do great things, but fall. When these people reach their lowest point, they don't have to go try new things; instead they can do the things they did when they were great. For instance, you were a professional athlete but became lazy and quit training. Instead of doing something new, you can simply go back to training in order to better yourself. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> An Ode to Fallen Fapstronauts </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-09 19:34:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Fallen Fapstronauts are the men that have failed to kill the many headed beast called Porn, which now slowly eats them as they toil and scream. This ode is meant to serve as an inspiration for such men and all men who come to read these words of the gods:

Oh, Sing you Muses of these men, the men who tried to fight the immortal monster Porn! The men, who were once so brave and valiant, lured in by the beauty and pleasure of Porn. Like the Sirens, Porn sung sweet promises of ecstasy to even the lowest of us, all of which could be acquired for no work. Oh, if only did we not see how all to good it was!

Oh you poor men, who eventually realized the error of your path. The beautiful forests became deserts of death, the god-like face of Porn a reviling and hideous monster. You tried to fight, tried to run, sword in hand against the beast. Yet the many headed creature would not stop attacking. You poor souls, who were so near victory, gave up and surrendered, to your own laziness and incompetence. Now you lie prisoner as you are slowly eaten alive, watching yourself slowly decade into nothing. At the bottom of the pit you lie, watching other men above you as they tower to heights of greatness. Your hands which would help you defeat the beast and climb the pit are used for other purposes. What happiness lies in such an existence? Your sword lies only a few feet away. The monster does not think you will take up your sword and fight. It has broke you. That is what you think. Yet it is there, only a little bit away. Perhaps, just maybe....

	<TEXT> A while back I created an ode to such a fallen hero. Here it is:

Let us say a final farewell to this unnamed hero, a hero who was once a brother, a fellow fapstronaut, who stood side by side by us in the war against porn, a war against a degrading and destructive act, a monster as deadly as the Sirens. Let us pay homage to the man who survived 76 hurricanes, each greater than the last, only for his ship to sink upon the 77th hurricane. He fought to keep ship afloat, through biting wind and laughing waves, to no avail. At the bottom of the ocean he lies a hero, an inspiration for us all. His courage will never be forgotten. With these words in our hearts, I, and my NoFap brothers say a final farewell. Rest in Peace, brother, rest in peace. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seeing hookers is not going to help you develop your relationships and social life. And trust me, the vast majority of us *need* social interactions since we are social animals.

You said your social life is at zero so start taking small steps in the right direction. Maybe even something as simple as saying hello to people you pass by on the street. If you have anxiety about meeting new people, you can also seek professional help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. NoFap is not a magic pill that will solve all your problems. Abstaining from PMO will not suddenly make you some sort of good looking, super confident alpha.* That said, NoFap goes beyond abstaining from PPMO, and is a lifestyle change replacing bad habits with good ones. These changes will increase your confidence, calm, etc. 

2. The problem seems to be you crave instant gratification (or pleasures) in the form of food. While eating sweets here and there isn't bad, I would be watchful of your diet. As for what you can do, start doing rewarding yet good and constructive activities like sports, weight lifting, hobbies, etc. Dont try and cheat your dopamine reward system; use it as it was intended for the best results.

*There are benefits from just abstaining from PMO, like semen retention, but I highly suggest going beyond that. </TEXT>
