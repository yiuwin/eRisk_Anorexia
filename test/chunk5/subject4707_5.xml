	<TEXT> I think too many people worry about the weight on the bar. It's all relative. Just keep progressing the weight little by little when you know you can handle it and eventually it'll become routine! I think when we are in dark places, we look for negativity. You probably look a lot different to what you think you do, i know i do!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I genuinely waited for the right moment. When people say "oh you don't eat much" or "you seem quiet today" then thread it into the conversation. People don't mind heavy responses if they ask a question they prepare to have an answer like that for. Find your moment, take a breath and just say it. It's nothing to be ashamed about, I assure you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aha apologise! Judgemental of me!

Yeah I'd ignore scales. Water mass weights a lot, that fluctuates. Fat mass and muscle mass change a lot, I'd honestly ignore the scales completely. Set your diet, set your goals, and lift. Take pictures as you go and see where it takes you. You've got this! You know where to find me if you need me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good lad! I hated looking at myself but if I didn't take the pictures of my progress, I'd have nothing to show for it when I got to where I wanted to be. And I was definitely going to get to where I wanted to be!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try going to the gym and sitting in the corner and reading. Even if you don't work out you maintain your routine of going to the gym so when you do want to lift, you're still in the habit of going :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fitness is a small door, you've got to step through it to see just how much you can do once you get there. I'm happy you stopped looking at the numbers! For a long time I stopped wearing short sleeve shirts and just wore jumpers so I can gain weight without looking at it. I suppose that's similar to you not looking at the scales!

I'm glad it also transferred into your private projects. I'm very happy that you were able to find happiness and motivation, there are a lot of similarities between us! Keep up the good work man, and thank you 3 </TEXT>
