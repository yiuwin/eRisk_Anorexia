	<TEXT> I was a 25 year old alcoholic woman. I was jobless, homeless and had zero social contact because people had gotten rid of me.

I am now 31, married, have a career I love and own a home.

I was where you are. It got a lot better for me. It was hard work, but it's been immensely worth it.

There is hope. I was also furious at myself. I was so fucking mad it took me years to finish my undergrad. That I had ZERO job references because I fucked off and quit without considering the consequences. I had no friends left. 

I am so glad you're here. What a journey lies before you, should you choose to take it :) </TEXT>

Many under the "Science" section see addiction from a different perspective than than the classic disease model. Although, not everyone who believes in the disease model paints alcoholics are gutter dwelling wife-bashing zombies :)

Personally I love reading Gabor Mate.

But my favourite depiction of substance abuse has got to be [Rat Park by Bruce Alexander](http://www.brucekalexander.com/articles-speeches/rat-park/148-addiction-the-view-from-rat-park)

	<TEXT> I progressed in substance abuse and dependence from a very innocent place.

I don't know if everyone progresses from binge drinking to dependence. I did, and it's rare that someone just becomes an "alcoholic" a week after they start drinking.

So at the end of the line for you could be "No problem drinking" or a "Return to social drinking within healthy limits" or it could be "Borderline substance abuse" or "Substance abuse"

So for me it comes down to risk. Quitting now could reduce the risk of developing a serious problem. Or you might not develop a problem and stopping now could stop you from socially enjoying alcohol.

For me, the health benefits of quitting far outweigh any dream I have of being a regular drinker.  </TEXT>

I found that I needed to do a few things everyday in early recovery. Recovery readings, talking about my feelings, being honest with myself, checking in with other recovering people, going to meetings (group therapy and I went to AA).

It sounds like a lot, but getting actively involved in recovering helped me stay on the ball.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In early sobriety I avoided all these events. Not because I thought I'd drink. Because I was spinning in my fucking head before the event occurred: planning, obsesssing and wondering. These events messed with my CURRENT state of mind.

It was easier for me to say "No, not yet. I have the rest of my life to make friends and socialize. Today I choose to be present and not obsess"

After a few months, I had a more solid footing and felt more comfortable exploring the adult world of drinks/mingling/parties. </TEXT>

Now we're returning home and watching football. We made some hot tea (it's cold here today) and are eating some veggies and dip.

Tonight we are painting a room in the house, and doing some yoga together. Then we will eat dinner and play Settlers of Catan.

	<TEXT> My ex asked me to go to rehab and kicked me out of our apartment. 

I got out of rehab and he asked me if I could have a beer now and then

I firmly believe people don't understand addiction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Edit

It's also not the amount drunk that defines addiction. Addiction can be defined as experiencing cravings, having withdrawal symptoms, persisting despite negative consequences, etc etc. The actual criteria for entering into 'addiction' is something only a professional could diagnose you with. 

These are 11 criteria that get examined when seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist/professional for susbtance abuse:

1. Taking the substance in larger amounts or for longer than the you meant to

2. Wanting to cut down or stop using the substance but not managing to
3. Spending a lot of time getting, using, or recovering from use of the substance
4. Cravings and urges to use the substance
5. Not managing to do what you should at work, home or school, because of substance use
6. Continuing to use, even when it causes problems in relationships
7. Giving up important social, occupational or recreational activities because of substance use
8. Using substances again and again, even when it puts the you in danger
9. Continuing to use, even when the you know you have a physical or psychological problem that could have been caused or made worse by the substance
10. Needing more of the substance to get the effect you want (tolerance)
11. Development of withdrawal symptoms, which can be relieved by taking more of the substance.

Of course, this was not meant for you to self-diagnose or self-undiagnose. It's just information that is out there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every country has a different level of drinking that is considered low-risk. 

For example, this is [Canada's current low-risk guideline](http://www.ccsa.ca/Resource%20Library/2012-Canada-Low-Risk-Alcohol-Drinking-Guidelines-Brochure-en.pdf)

[page 28 of this long paper](http://cclat.ca/Resource%20Library/2011-Summary-of-Evidence-and-Guidelines-for-Low-Risk%20Drinking-en.pdf) gives a somewhat harrowing description of the increased risks associated with having a certain  number of drinks per day.

	<TEXT> It helped me to accept that things were going to feel weird the first X amount of time I went without drinking. I find that people go in with high hopes that everything is going to be peachy and fun without alcohol, and get discouraged when expectations and reality don't mix.

Your sobriety. 

I am not sure I could stick to a once a week schedule. 

Are you? And if you can't stick to that, are you perhaps using this an an excuse to go back out?

It seems like there's some apprehension about your decision to drink. I hope you explore this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I realized that I had built a lot of walls. I'd be quick to reject if I felt any sort of tension or resistance. 

I think for myself, I developed a lot of these behaviours because it was my survival mechanism. People used to get in my face about my drinking, years before I got sober, and I'd just yell and push them away. Sooner or later they stopped approaching me about it...but then they also stopped approaching me for anything :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Big events like this made me nervous as well. I focused on staying sober in the interim, and trying not to fixate too much on events in the future.

That being said, I didn't attend any parties or events that had alcohol involved for the first 5 months. Then I babystepped back into events. I attended with sober people who I trusted, I had a game plan in case I got too sensitive, I made sure I had an exit, I knew who to call if I had a craving.

The biggest thing for me was knowing I could leave and setting it up so that I didn't have to wait for a ride. I drove myself to a lot of parties, and had my phone on stand by with people I could call. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really enjoyed rehab. I was in an inpatient facility for 35 days. 

Pros

- time away from my regular life

- gave my family time to themselves

- met lots of people in recovery

- had no outside distractions: no dishes, no meal preparation, nothing. just recovery, homework, meetings, chatting to nurses, doctors and social workers and other recovering people

- very supportive. I was constantly surrounded by people who wanted to help me and listen. 

- an extremely thought out and researched treatment plan. My team consisted of a social worker, an addiction doctor (yes they exist), a psychologist and an addiction counsellor. They had team meetings every day to discuss everyone's progress. 

Cons

- travel time to get there was 7 hour car ride

	<TEXT> Please do not criticize other people's posts. It's one of the rules of the subreddit. 

I actually agree with you in terms of us projecting time onto others. Unfortunately this post directly criticzes a couple venting posts that are up right now, and that's not appopriate for a place that you said yourself: "should be framed as positive reinforcement for getting and staying sober"

We very rarely get posts shaming others who drink. Sometimes we get a post linking to someone being hilariously drunk, and we remove those. Social commentary about drinking is entirely appropriate, as we're social beings and venting about it is fine. It happened during every single group I went to: we all needed to bitch about it at some point.

If you aren't happy with the way SD is, that's part of the process of understanding that the world does not have to conform to your beliefs.

"You drink, feel buzzed, then you just need to maintain it a bit."

That made no sense to me. Like no, you drink, get drunk, and then black out.

That was how I viewed alcohol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure how to process this. Honestly, I had a lot of trauma to deal with when I got into recovery. I did it gently with the help of a caring friend who I could vent to and a psychologist who helped me piece through what I needed.

Treatment didn't touch everything that needed to be healed. It just allowed the gate to open.

I am glad to see you back tonight :) </TEXT>
