	<TEXT> Eating disorders.. all of them... are illnesses. Your mind, your brain, it is not healthy nor is it functioning properly. It is not about what weight you are, or what type of behaviours you engage in. 

If you spend every day waking up to the thought of how you wish everything about your body was different, then you are unwell. 

an eating disorder I not a case of a diet gone wrong, it is not a fad or a trend, it is a serious and debilitating illness that takes many lives. 

I was a healthy 14 year old girl and then my eating disorder popped up. a separate being came into my head and told me I was not good enough, that I could be perfect if I could have control over my food. I became consumed, and now I'm nearly 23 and facing my 4th admission for something that is out of my control. 

I would never wish an ED on anyone, and I am sure none of you would either.

Just know that you are not alone, that your eating disorder is not you and while there is a constant pull between 'not good enough' and 'perfection' there is no winning.
