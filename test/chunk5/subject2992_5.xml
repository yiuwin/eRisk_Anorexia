	<TEXT> [Cherry](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1315350/). It's a romcom, which I'm not usually a fan of, but I'm just in love with it. Also, there's a 90% chance you'll cry at some point. It stars Kyle Gallner, Laura Allen, and Britt Robertson. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The part about children in hospitals getting creative is true. My friend was in an intensive care unit when she was 14 for self-harming. At that hospital, she couldn't use any knives (even plastic), no pencils unless under close watch, etc. She said that one night after dinner she managed to hide a bone from a chicken wing (that was kind of pointy at the end) in a crevice in the couch in the day room. The next day she stuffed it in her pocket and went to town later that night after lights out. 

**EDIT: That friend of mine is now pretty deep into recovery. She's almost 17 now and hasn't harmed herself in over 100 days.**  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm commenting on this literally 4 months after, but whatever. For any of you who haven't seen [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZevrhenBYM) (skip to 25:20), I am so happy Matt answered my email. He saved my life. I decided to reach out when it was almost too late. I had to go to the emergency room literally the day after this video was uploaded because my heart wasn't beating normally, I could barely walk without horrible pain, I felt like I could pass out at any second, my blood pressure was extremely low (so I had the dizziness from that). I was terrified. So I was told that it was a good thing I reached out. In order to just be able to go *home* form the ER, I had to be given 2 IV packs because I was so dehydrated and malnourished. Basically, they said that if I didn't come in, my heart probably would have stopped. So I was officially diagnosed with "very severe anorexia nervosa" by the doctors and was in the emergency room for around 8 hours. 

So I promised myself that I would get help, and I did. Kind of. I tried finding a therapist, I looked into residential programs, went to check ups at a couple doctors (GP, endocrinologist), etc. Despite being told that I was dangerously underweight and that I was at somewhat of a risk at having my heart stop beating, it didn't really all sink in and the disordered voice (which I refer to as Ana) took over and pushed the rational part of my brain completely out of the way. So I started starving again and exercising obsessively like before. I was DETERMINED to get to 100 lbs, if not somewhere in the 90s. I was even told that it was likely that I'd be dead before I got to 95 lbs. But of course Ana took over and made me feel like shit. There was a day when my mom went out to the store and I was left home alone. In the little time she was gone, I did 200 sit ups, 200 jumping jacks, 100 push ups, and 120 squats. I had really started cutting at that point too--like a lot. Not only on my hips (my usual place) but on my wrists too (I rarely ever cut there). I even hid a razor blade under one of the sinks at school so I could get my relief. 

Everything was shit. I couldn't stop cutting, I got really lightheaded and my vision started to black out every single time I stood up from a sitting or lying down position (orthostatic hypotension, where your blood pressure drops when going from lying down to sitting to standing), my hair was falling out, and my body was always achey. So yeah. In mid-February, I decided that I'd had enough. I found a therapist, I'd opened up to a few of my friends, I saw a nutritionist, and decided that I didn't want to die like this. Because I was honestly very close to death. The doctors in the hospital had actually told me I had one of the lowest BMIs they'd seen in a while.

So as of today, May 20th, 2015, I am still struggling, but I'm so much better than I was. I now have a BMI of 17 (still underweight, but no longer dangerous), I don't always want to cry when I see my weight (only very rarely), my hair isn't falling out anymore, I don't get orthostatics, my blood sugar levels have been much better, and I haven't cut in 62 days. Sure, I've wanted to cut. Just last week I was staring at my razor, deciding whether or not I would do it (I didn't, by the way). 

Honestly, Matt, thank you so much for all you've done for me. I've thanked you so much in the past for this, I know. But I can't ever thank you enough because had you not made this video, I probably would not be alive. You literally saved my life. This video gave me the courage to get help. I couldn't have ever done it without you. 

(And Matt, I already know you know most of this, but hey, why not tell it again? You know I'm great about over-sharing and making walls of text, haha) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've posted this story on reddit before but I can't find the link, so I'll tell it again: 

[The room set-up for reference](http://imgur.com/ujWKZ7x). The blue marks are doorways.

This happened when I was around the age of 10, I think, though I think I may have been a couple years younger (I'm 18 now). In my old house, I had the typical things happen: footsteps upstairs when I was the only one home (my parents were ok with leaving me alone because my neighborhood was really safe), feeling like someone tapped my shoulder when I was doing homework or on the computer, ceiling fans turning on for no reason, etc. My parents always managed to come up with some far-off explanation to keep me from getting scared, which only sometimes worked. 

There was one night when I wasn't feeling good and I wanted to sleep with my mom. My dad was and still is in the picture, but he used to have a snoring problem, so he'd sleep in the master bedroom and my mom would sleep in the guest room. Our guest bedroom had a twin bed with a pull out trundle, so it was perfect: that night, my mom slept in the regular bed and I was on the trundle. The beds were in the upper right corner of the guest room facing the wall, not the door to the bonus room. These details are important, trust me. Our house felt kinda stuffy that night, so we kept the door from the guest room to the bonus room open to air it out a little. 

It was around midnight when we ended up actually going to bed. My dad was already asleep in the master bedroom--not pictured; the room labeled "bed" is my bedroom, and the master is down the hall--since he had work early in the morning.  This means that all our TVs were off in the whole house. Our windows were also closed because we kept hearing coyotes outside and they were super loud without the windows closed. 

So enough backstory. I was lying in bed (facing away from the doors) and my mom was cleaning the counter in the bathroom. I was almost asleep when I heard a voice. I sounded like it was coming from the bonus room (if not the guest room). It was the voice of a little girl (she sounded like she was 5 or 6 years old) and she said, "Mamma?" It seriously sounded like it came from no more than 10 feet away and the voice was so clear. 

When I heard it, my breath caught in my throat and I went completely still (after I pulled my covers over my head, of course). I started trying to think of rational reasons like my parents always tried to convince me into believing. I tried to convince myself that it was just my imagination, but that thought was quickly interrupted when my mom said from the bathroom, "Megan?" So I said, "Yeah?" Then she said, "Did you just say 'mamma'?" 

So at that point I was like *oh SHIT*. I replied with a shaky voice, "No..." and my mom just went "Huh, nevermind." It is a miracle that I was actually able to fall asleep after that. Then again, I couldn't sleep in my own room for like a month after that. 

To be honest, even though it's almost 10 years later, I still lie in bed at night and pray that I don't hear that voice again. It still freaks me out. 

Oh, and one more thing. Some of you are probably thinking siblings... I'm an only child.  </TEXT>
