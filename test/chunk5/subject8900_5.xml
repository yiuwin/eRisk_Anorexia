	<TEXT> I have been searching for a good makeup remover. I prefer oil based or creams but they break me out. Currently I'm using Bioderma Sebium Micellar Water but it takes a lot of product and cotton pads to properly remove everything. I'm out of ideas, so if you have found a really good one I would love to hear about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to the pychiatrist after coming back from the Clnic because I couldn,t sleep the first week thinking that I had cancer constanly. She prescribed me paroxetine but I said to her I would think about it because I don,t want to take meds. I have never found a pscholohist that helped me really. I was seeing one for three years and I quit. The others I didn,t last more than a few months. I don,t know how to manage this anxiety... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She says it's not diabetic pain. She sent him to a pain specialist and he'd conducted ecographies and nuclear tests (sorry I'm not english speaker and don't know how to say this in English). He also made him a full blood panel and he has: severe anemia, d3 and b12 vitamin deficiency and high tryglicerids. He's taking d3 vitamin shots. They prescribed him paracetamol 1gram as pain killer, obviously that's doing nothing for him. I bought him a cayenne cream that doesn't do nothing... 

Edit: before the q fever he had only diabetes and high tryglicerids. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My father, 65yo, is diabetic type 2 since he was 60 and has extreme insomnia and sleep apnea since I can remember. Last year he was hospitalized for a month because he contracted something called "Q-fever" that I've tried to figure out but I don't find much info about. I'm staying for a few weeks at my parents and I'm so sad and worried because since I'm here (and this has been happening for months, my mum told me) he can't sleep at all and spend the night crying and screaming in pain in his feet. He's seen doctors, he goes to specialists in pain and no one gives him an answer or a solution. I've bought him creams and my mother has taken him to massages and nothing relieves him. He's aged like 10 years sice January because he's not resting at all and he can't drive or even walk due to this. I'm sad and very worried and I really need help, at least to know if do you have any advise that can help him to relieve his pain and any idea of what could he has and be tested to to help this. I don't know what else to do and both my mother and me are desperate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it seem to be the first... But I don't understand, I really didn't have it a few months ago. This picture was taken exactly two months and one week ago, a week before I started the Goodal cream. I have dark circles but not those weird lines.

	<TEXT> Hello,

I started with AB a couple of months ago but I ddin't patch test at first and I have been breaking out so badly so I went back to my old routine and now that my skin seems to be alright I want to start doing it right. I wanted to introduce an oil cleanser as I loved how it makes my skin clean and smooth but I'm fairly positive that oil cleanser was what made me break out at first. I used Banila Co. Clean it Zero original, Tonymoly Aqua sherbet cleanser and lately jojoba oil. I wanted to know if there is an emulsified oil cleanser or cream or balm suitable for very acne prone skin, I was reading about DHC deep cleasning oil but I would love to hear your recommendations. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had the same for a while,, I don't know what was causing it and I have no clue now neither. The hydrocortisone was helpful, also a cream that my derm prescribed me that I think is another type of cortisone (fluocortolona 2 mg (0,2 %) the brand name in Spain is "Ultralan") and a moisturizer called "Benpathol calm cream". 

I also took oral antihistaminics, that really helped. What I found best to keep that controlled was: not using perfumes of any kind (nor in the skincare products, but specially in my neck, I used to put my perfume there and it made the dermatitis much worse) and control the anxiety. Change my pillowcases every other day. Hope it helps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree with this. My skin is a bit dark and it leaves me a super white cast. I was using the essence and it was perfect but I live in a hot and humid climate and didn't know it wasn't waterproof, I bought it thinking they were alike but they have nothing in common, the milk seems a little thinner than european brands, but not much. Now I'm super dissapointed. The one you say (Shisheido) is like the essence? I have oily and shinny acne prone skin. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Skin Concern] New deep wrinkles under my eyes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-10 18:14:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had dark circles for years due to my insomnia and I wanted to make them look better. I bought several eye creams and all of them made my eyes ich, I found one that felt good, "Goodal Eyes Moisturizer cream", but after two months using it, many people told me how bad were my under eyes, I asked here and a nice redditor told me it could very possible be the eye cream so I stopped using it and following an advise I started using Paula's choice retinol 1% mixed with regular moisturizer (Nivea) under the eyes, followed by a layer of vaseline In the morning I use some Paula's choice serum with vitamin c under the sunscreen. I don't see any improvement and I'm really sad about these wrinkles and I hope is not too late to do something about them. If you have any recommendation, I want to buy something really effective or use something that I have, but I can't decide. I was thinking about Skin Ceauticals C E Ferulic or Mad Hippie Vitamin C or some Avene eye creams that I read here. Any piece of advise will be really appreciated.
