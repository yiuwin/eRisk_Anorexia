	<TEXT> Yeah for sure. I don't get it. My physical wds haven't been quite as bad after my relapse as they were the first time around. (Except for the sneezing. Damn it's a bitch) But the mental and emotional ones are SO much worse than I was expecting. I don't remember my head being this messed up the first time around. It almost seems physically painful how messed up and foggy my head feels. All I want to do is make a phone call and find something. But I can't. I know that. I'm trying so so hard not to give in. I feel so stupid and pathetic. But I just want to cry. When do you start being able to think straight and get some sleep again? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. I just feel like I'm losing it right now. My head is all over the place and nowhere at the same time. If that makes any sense. Trying really hard to not fuck up again. But damn. I just wish I could get some  sleep. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this isn't the typical type of post but is anyone else up? I'm struggling really hard right now. This is the beginning of my day 7 after about a 3 week relapse. I have a final in less than 8 hours. I can't sleep for the life of me. It's killing me. I can't focus. I've been trying to study but my head just seems like it's stuck in a fog. Anyone else get that in early recovery? I'm almost certain I'm going to fail this final. I'm dreading having to go sit it. I can't make that voice telling me that I know EXACTLY what would help me sleep and make me stop stressing for a little while shut up. I'm trying so hard to not make that phone call. I don't know what to do. 

edit: GOD I CAN'T STOP SNEEZING. It's driving me INSANE. 


Edit: Just finished writing my exam. Don't think I aced it by any means, but I made it through. One more for the week and I'll be done. Hopefully by friday I'll be thinking better. THANK YOU so much for the support. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this is technically from yesterday. But I'm stressing and this is the only place I could think to come. It's 1:30 am. Today is my day 7 after about a 3 week long relapse. I have my third final of the week in 8 hours. I can't sleep for the life of me. My head is all over the place. I'm almost certain I'm going to fail. I CANNOT focus. I feel like shit. I don't know why I'm having such a hard time. But that voice in my head telling me that I know EXACTLY what would calm me down and help me sleep and feel better will not. shut. up. It's driving me crazy. I'm trying so hard not to make that call or send that text. But Damn. It's getting harder and harder it seems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some people use immodium and other subs. For me and the people I've talked to, cold turkey is best. I'm coming off a relapse and I'm struggling pretty hard right now. But I KNOW if I used a sub I'd just get hooked on that. Find an NA meeting. If you have any clean friends, ask if you can spend the day with them. When I very first detoxed, the withdrawals killed me. I had a friend who let me stay at his house for like 4 days. He just sat with me and watched the original Star Trek and made me tea and let me be pathetic and cuddle up with him. I don't know if I would have made it without his support. Another thing that really helped me was just doing some research. I spent hours looking up everything I could about withdrawals so I would know how long they normally last and what I could expect. That was helpful for me because I could tell myself "okay this sucks right now but it'll be over soon." If you don't have any clean friends, this is a great GREAT place to come. You can pm me and I'll give you my number if you want. So many people here are great about being supportive and helping you through it. I really can't recommend NA enough either. It's scary and intimidating the first time but it is SO worth it. If you go and introduce yourself as a newcomer they'll give you a list of phone numbers of people there that you can call if you're having a hard time. 

Just keep your head up. Know that even though you feel like you're going to die YOU AREN'T. You've got this. Best of luck to ya. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just finished writing my first final of the week. Coming down with the flu on top of some minor physical withdrawals from my relapse. Today is day 5. Stressing out beyond belief. Can't focus very well. I'm terrified about these finals. Really, really not sure how I'm going to make it through the week without picking up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been better. Only on day 4. But that's longer than I've had in about a month. Feeling sick as fuck trying to study for finals. A little beaten down and discouraged. Been trying to post here to get my head on straight and get some advice. Trying to keep my head up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, I'm just going to apologize for being THAT obnoxious person who keeps coming back and forth. I'm trying. I've just struggling right now. And I'm sorry if it's a bit of a read.. I just need some where to tell what's been going on and hopefully get my head on straight.

I picked up my 30 days the beginning of November. And then lost it not too long after. Things have been rough the past month or so. Some things because of my own actions, and some that are out of my control. The main thing that's been messing with my head is that my ex boyfriend who I helped send to jail for physical and sexual assault got out of jail about 2 months ago and has been doing things that are just flat out not okay and giving me shit basically since he got out. I'm trying to figure out what I can and should do legally and trying to deal with what's he's doing. It's messing with my head and bringing up some hard memories. My anxiety flares up really badly whenever he's involved. I know that's not an excuse to use, it's just a major trigger I'm trying to work through.

I just started a new job. It's a actually a really good place for me to be. I've seen quite a few people there I recognize from NA so I know it's definitely a better environment than where I was before. But new jobs are always stressful in the beginning. I struggle with pretty heavy seasonal depression that I can feel starting to hit. I have finals coming up I'm nowhere near prepared for (ah the joys of being a drug addict in college. responsibility goes out the window). I started smoking again. Which I know isn't the worst thing in the world. But I thought it was something I'd actually succeeded at quitting. Guess not. 

I have a dealer I used to buy from giving me crazy amounts of shit right now, trying to get me to buy or inviting me over to come shoot up with them and freaking out at me when I say no thanks. I don't want to be rude to him. I keep telling him no thanks and that I'm trying not to do that anymore. But he won't leave me alone. From Facebook messages to texts and calls to texting and calling people he knows I hang out with. I don't know why he's so set on breaking me, but I can't get him to leave me alone. I don't know how to tell him to fuck off without being a total bitch.

I don't know. I don't really know why I've been fucking up so badly lately. But I can't seem to get more than a few days clean. This is the beginning of day 4. It's longest I've gone since getting 30 days. I know something has to change. I just feel so overwhelmed and like I can't keep it together. I don't know. I'm failing and fucking up hard. I just need some help and support. I've been stubborn and stupid. I know that. I just don't know how to handle everything that's going on right now.

Thanks to anyone who stayed with me through that rant and to everyone here for being so great and supportive. Much love to everyone out there. Keep doing the good things you're doing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not good. I can't seem to get more than a couple days clean. I know it's no one's fault but my own. I know it's on my shoulders that I can't. I just don't know what's wrong. I keep fucking up. I just started a new job and it's kicking my butt. I'm sick CONSTANTLY because I keep going back and forth between using and then getting a few days clean then breaking and using again. I can't sleep. Maybe 2 hours a night max right now. I don't know. I'm just losing it. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to stay positive.. But.. I'm having a difficult time. I know life isn't supposed to be easy and it never will be. But damn. I didn't know it was going to be this hard either. </TEXT>
