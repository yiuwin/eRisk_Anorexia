	<TEXT>  If a non-white sued for a racist comment directed at them, they would get all types of support.

No they wouldn't... and if you have proof to prove otherwise, link it... 

As for the other issues, he's a politician. He talks about getting the evangelical vote a lot, and needs a controversial and somehow relatable stance on certain topics. He's not going to censor shit. Jokes on everyone who believed it.

what a fucking joke of an answer

hahaha, trump supporter trying to justify suing over a joke

and your "example" wasn't a joke? getting harassed by thousands on social media is a little different from being called a monkey son from a COMEDIAN, plus she didn't sue?

care to defend the others I listed?

	<TEXT> Milo is a hypocrite, a quote from him in 2012

So perhaps whats needed now is a bolder form of censure after all, because the internet is not a universal human right. If people cannot be trusted to treat one another with respect, dignity and consideration, perhaps they deserve to have their online freedoms curtailed. For sure, the best we could ever hope for is a smattering of unpopular show trials. But if the internet, ubiquitous as it now is, proves too dangerous in the hands of the psychologically fragile, perhaps access to it ought to be restricted. **We ban drunks from driving because theyre a danger to others. Isnt it time we did the same to trolls?**

his just like a right wing SJW, so also supports the biggest PC police; trump, sues the onion for a satire article about him and sues Bill Maher for making a joke about him. </TEXT>

No, he just understands that trump cannot become president, how is a democrat endorsing the democrat nominee = pussy? he had lost, what do you expect him to do? Trump/Cruz and Sanders/Clinton isn't really comparable either. clinton didnt call his wife ugly or said that his dad killed Kennedy.

Plus Sanders is 74.. his not running again..

Cruz is like 44... he could run again in 15 years if he wants to.. clearly banking on trump losing

also fuck /r/politics anyway </TEXT>
