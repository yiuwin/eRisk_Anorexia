	<TITLE> [Serious] Daters of Reddit: What's the best way to approach Valentine's Day when you're just beginning to date someone? It seems weird to celebrate love when you're still in the process of figuring that out, but it's also seems weird to do nothing. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Newborns also "smile." But though we take them to be smiling, they don't think they are (hence the "consciously"). The fine point is that there is nothing that stops any baby from smiling; it is a matter of when they intend to smile, and how they come about doing so on command. 

I'm sure that smiling as an expression of joy is something not foreign to blind children. Still, the mimicing of facial expression is not a nonfactor in how sighted babies come to intentionally smile. So your counterexample does not actually invalidate the piece above or my point; they're not mutually exclusive.

At least that is how I understand it. </TEXT>

<WRITING>
	<TITLE> TIL that babies do not consciously smile until they are at least six weeks old. Before they do, they mimic the facial expressions of their parents. Such developments are important because they indicate how babies become aware of their social world. </TITLE>
