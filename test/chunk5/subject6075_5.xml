	<TEXT> Requiem for a Dream. The way Marlon Wayans and Jared Leto were screaming at the end like "MY ARM, MY FUCKING ARM!!!", and, "SOMEBODY HELP US, SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US!!" and their faces are blurring as if the screen Is vibrating, left my heart feeling like it was going to explode out of my chest with empathy for them :'(

	<TEXT> Also people will come right up to you and blow powder like substance in your face that makes you do everything they say. A lot of people get raped or robbed. So don't let strangers approach you! It's beautiful but a country in a crisis will have a lot of desperate citizens doing anything it takes for cash </TEXT>
