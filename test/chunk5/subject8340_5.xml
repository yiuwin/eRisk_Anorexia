	<TEXT> I was in 6th grade riding the bus home and I called Todd Sugimoto "Chinese Face". He was a taller Japanese student who played the trombone. I played the trumpet so I think it might have been a band scuffle. In my older age of wisdom, which I find new on a daily basis, I righteously deserved the ass kicking that would ensue after our departure from the bus.

After he kicked my ass, I screamed from the ground..."l'm mad now!!!" He gave no care and walked home. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you will be happy to know that Don broke the two party system. The Democrats know it and the Republicans know it. What you see on the news is them drowning at sea. They are gasping and grabbing at anything thing they can. When Trump succeeds, the sheet will be torn from the bed and all the mites will be shown for what they have done...absolutely nothing. The Democratic party will be done for at least a generation. Just because Trump has an R by his name doesn't clear the Republican established leaders. They are in the same boat. It is a great time for us!!! The two party system is destroyed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Get a big pitcher so you can make more if you want(it amazes me how often people get the minimum only wish that they got something bigger). Just watch the temp on a large pitcher. It will heat up a lot faster than a smaller pitcher if we are talking the same amount of milk. Always use a thermometer. 140f at the most. keep the pitcher in the freezer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you need more than 2250 of disposable income for an espresso machine, you need to do more research. Most of your semi-professional machines are well within that budget. Just get a real good grinder and you will be set for life. Seriously, life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got mine about halfway out, didn't like what I was seeing and tried to put it back but it won't fully line up straight again. I'm pretty frustrated with it. I'm going to take it to my local shop and put a different sight in. 

I can't for the life of me understand why it was made this way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I second this. Pound it until the breast is 1/4" thick. Light olive oil in a fry pan on medium to medium high and a couple minutes later...done.

The Italians call it "Scallopini". Look up some easy sauces to go with it. You can't go wrong.  Also, try some different chicken. </TEXT>
