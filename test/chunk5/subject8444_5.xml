	<TITLE> To keep or not to keep my ships [XBOX] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-12 10:28:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I now have more ships than I do have slots. I have dry docked two lower tier ships (and trashed the gear that they had (super low level stuff). I can't decide if I should dry dock / get rid of them, as in all likelihood I don't fly them again. My dilemma is that I've been using my old ships as parts storage. If I dry dock them I don't have the space for all those parts. Also I want to get the dilithium ships from the ship req person as I want the admiralty cards.

The main question is is there any reason to keep most of the lower tier ships?

I know I can buy more ship slots, but not sure if that is the best use of my resources as zen isn't exactly cheap. </TEXT>
