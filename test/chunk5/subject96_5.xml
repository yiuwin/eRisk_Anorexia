	<TEXT> You just can't come to terms with the fact that a federal judge straight up acknowledged that racist gerrymandering in Texas was unconstitutional and that republicans have to stop doing it to gain an unfair advantage in the House.

They acknowledged that 3 districts out of 36 were unfair and needed to be changed. The other 33 were fine.

Also, Republicans won the nationwide House popular vote and would have won the Senate popular vote if not for California's screwy election laws. There is no "unfair advantage" for Republicans, as both sides gerrymander - just look at Maryland's fucked districts, the worst in the country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> broke up the Hispanic constituency of Doggett's district.

boi what

They put all the Hispanics in that area in one district, they did not break them up

The notion that there wouldn't be any black congressman without gerrymandering is so fucking out of touch.

...It's true. The vast majority of black congresspeople come from black plurality districts. Obama's district in the Illinois State Senate was 73% black. Every single black Representative is from a district that is at least 21% black, which is nearly twice the black percentage as the national average. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love how you think you can take one quote from a nearly 200 page article and pretend like that's true. Actually, the plan:

"was improperly drawn with race as the predominant factor to minimize the number of Democrat districts and to attempt to unseat Doggett by boosting the Hispanic population, making it more likely that voters would choose a Latino candidate... By drawing Doggett's district with a majority Hispanic population extending into San Antonio, the Republican-controlled Legislature was able to "create the facade of complying" with the Voting Rights Act while eliminating an existing Democratic district, the panel ruled."

They weren't "diluting minority voting strength", they were packing minorities more into one district (of the 3 ruled illegal) by making it Hispanic majority. That's not "diluting" minority voting strength, it is strengthening it. </TEXT>

You don't seem to understand how gerrymandering works at all. Having a majority-minority district allows minorities to have more representation than they would if they were dispersed evenly. In most parts of the country, it's the only reason there are black congressmen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's linguistic prescriptivism. Words change meaning over time, constantly. Just go to /r/badlinguistics, which is full of your anarchist friends.

However, the original use of the term "libertarian" was as *a defender of liberty*, i.e. liberals, when the London Packet wrote (in 1796):  "Lately marched out of the Prison at Bristol, 450 of the French Libertarians." 

It was used again by the same paper in 1802 critiquing a poem thusly: 

"The author's Latin verses, which are rather more intelligible than his English, mark him for a furious Libertarian (if we may coin such a term) and a zealous admirer of France, and her liberty, under Bonaparte; such liberty!"

Ah, a supporter of the French Revolution - a liberal, then, not a socialist!

DeJacque did not use the term to mean "anarchist" until 1857, more than half a century later! 

Now, aside from the fact that words change meaning, it's pretty clear that "libertarian" was originally meant to mean a radical liberal, which is exactly what it means today in common parlance. Ironically, despite anarchists constantly bemoaning libertarians "stealing" their word (how ironic! You own nothing!), it's the anarchists who stole the word libertarian - based on their own warped concept of freedom. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have not suggested any significant cultural or historical differences you have with New York City,

We are far more Protestant - in particular there are a lot of Methodist and Reformed churches. (The Reformed churches being leftovers of Dutch colonial rule - our Dutch heritage is still a big thing here, just look at the flag of Albany.) Ever heard of the Burned-Over District? One of the epicenters of the Second Great Awakening? Oh, and Mormonism was founded in upstate New York, by Joseph Smith (I'm ashamed to say he's a distant relative of mine). NYC, by contrast, is largely Catholic, non-Christian, or irreligious.

We have much different demographics. We have more Germans, Dutch, and English people, as compared to NYC's large number of Italians and non-whites. 

Many areas in North Country have large amounts of French-Canadians. In Potsdam and Canton, you'll see Canadian flags flying. People speak French and love poutine there, and large areas of northern NY receive Canadian TV broadcasts. 

Upstate New York's dialect is actually closer to the Inland North dialect spoken in the midwest and parts of Canada than it is to downstate New York. 

We have a long history of secessionism, going back to 1969 - a lot of people in NYC even support secession, like Norman Mailer and Jimmy Breslin, who ran for office on a NYC secession ticket. Liberals in NYC and conservatives upstate often want to secede. The entire state of Vermont seceded from New York, and upstate NY is similar to Vermont in many ways.

As I outlined previously, which you completely ignored, we haven't had a governor from upstate in nearly a century and we have our first senator from upstate in 50 years. No fucking wonder upstate is rotting - despite your claim that "we elected these people", *upstate routinely votes against the people who win*, because NYC voters have different wants and needs than we do and they outnumber us.

That is the crux of my argument. It's not "rural vs urban", it's "upstate vs downstate". I'd be fine with electing people from Buffalo, Albany, Rochester, Syracuse, Ithaca, etc (I *live* in Albany for fuck's sake), because they at least share a similar outlook and understand the upstate economy, which is largely agrarian and factory-based, as opposed to downstate's economy.

You completely ignored every argument I made in favor of your arrogant snobbery against "those stupid parochial Americans". Simply pathetic.

Oh, and your country held a referendum on Scottish independence - which has about the same claim to independence as upstate.

you have outright said you want your vote to be more powerful than the vote of someone in NYC

I want both of us to be able to select governors and senators who share our cultural background and understand the issues of our area. How is that "more powerful" than someone in NYC?

you have insulted the truly important independence movements of the world by trying to compare yourself petty gripes with local government to them.

...How is it insulting to say that I also have valid complaints? Is it insulting to say you're hungry because some people are starving? Did I ever compare myself to the Tibetans or any other group of people who want to secede? Or is that just your assumption? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you think NYC and upstate New York aren't "culturally or historically distinct", you've clearly never been here and have no idea how the people here feel. Religiously, demographically, politically, culturally, we are distinct from New York City. I go to NYC every year and it's a magical land of enchantment - certainly not home.

But hey, typical Euro making assumptions about places they've never been to.

The limited influence upstate has, while proportional, leaves our part of the state at the mercy of people from a self-contained city, most of whom have never been up here except perhaps for a vacation at Lake George. We pay obscenely high taxes for programs we don't want, our votes effectively do not matter, and our interests are ignored in favor of NYC's interests. 

Have you ever heard of Utica? It's called "the city God forgot" because our state has allowed it to die. Upstate is rotting with no help from downstaters, who by and large have no idea.

Furthermore, upstate is tightly contested between Republicans and Democrats. Right now our votes don't matter. As an independent state we would be one of the largest swing states. Politicians would actually bother campaigning here. Our votes would matter, rather than being drowned out by the Democratic horde in NYC. The government might bother investing here. 

We would have a governor with our customs, who understands and cares about our problems. (We haven't had a governor from upstate since Nathan Miller, 1921-1922.) We would have two senators from upstate. (Kirsten Gilibrand is from upstate, but before her our last upstate senator was Charles Goodell, 1968.)

By every measure, we would be better off independent, and the people here broadly support it. You're basically saying "shut up and like it" without actually understanding anything about the area.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you'd have no problem if the court was made up of 9 Mormons, 9 Jews or 9 Catholics? It's a matter of representation - 6 Catholics and 3 Jews is far from representative of our country. Sonia Sotomayor famously argued that as a Hispanic woman she would have different insights than a white man - the same is true of different religions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) is the only openly irreligious Representative. However, most of those who refused to respond probably are, as (I would assume) is the Unitarian Universalist near Sacramento. There are also plenty of representatives who are actually irreligious but pay lip service to some bland form of Protestant Christianity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> because you haven't gone through it.

Actually I did, because I was a confused 13 year old and the tranny cult convinced me I had to inject myself with synthetic hormones and mutilate my body. And then I realized I am who I am, and trannies need help, not someone to enable them.

even if it was who cares?

Yeah, who cares if we let someone with a mental illness horribly and irrevocably mutilate their bodies? Who cares if someone with anorexia starves themselves or someone with DID cuts their legs off? It's just making them happy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's an interesting theory, but statistics show that blacks commit a disproportionately large number of murders (around 50% of the total). Utah and Idaho, both very religious and very Republican states, are in the same category as irreligious states like Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts, with the fewest murders. 

The common theme between Idaho and Utah is homogeneity. The common theme in the states with the highest murders is black population (which fits FBI stats about black crime). After all, it more closely tracks to the [Black Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Belt_(U.S._region) than the Bible Belt - note relatively lower rates in Kentucky, West Virginia, etc. with fewer blacks. </TEXT>
