	<TEXT> I haven't worked there in a couple years  but the things I mentioned are not one time payments.   It is a huge investment.   And 65 million is not enough for the jet.   I'm saying he will ask for very soon.   So it's not likely he going for a jet that expensive.   65 million is the tag price for the g650, currently the best one they have until the next one hits the stage.   A 550 bare bones is probably what the other guy said but after the average customizations is going to be closer to 55 million.   That's 10 million for the things I mentioned left over and the things I didn't mention like insurance.   

I'm not sure what you're trying to convince me of even if I did exaggerate the cost by saying "before you get in the jet".  The costs will rack up astronomically and it won't be stopping at 100 million.   

And he's probably not even looking at one.    That's all I'm saying.   For 65 million total he's probably looking at something much more realistic long run for that price range.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before a certain point that's how all recorded history is extrapolated.   That's not christains saying it, it's historians.   I'm not christain and I don't care what Jesus did it didn't do.   But to say he didn't exist as a person, well I don't know what to say.  Did Mohamad not exist?   How about sarkaad the first known emporer before the babylonians.   Did hammurabi not exist?  

I guess it doesn't matter, I just think you can be secular and still be fine with Jesus the prophet existing.   I mean unless college level text books and PBS and such are just pandering to christains, who knows.

	<TEXT> That's just how much the jet costs.   He needs a flight and maintenance crew.   Money for fuel and high cost repairs.   Mods upgrades are free with Gulfstream as long as they are necessary, so there are some savings.   But now all you have is the jet and the essentials.   Now you need a fucking flight line and a hangar to store it in.   You've just racked up half a billion and haven't gotten in the jet yet. 

For 65 it's probably some really low end jet.   I mean it's still a jet but you ain't getting no Gulfstream with that small amount.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The article concerning adultery wad not created because of the above comment.   It is an anecdotal example.   When it comes to protecting information there are many pitfalls besides the classic he mentioned.   

Some things that might help clear this up are: UCMJ does not mean laws nor can breaking one be considered illegal.   These are codes that all members adhere to.   Breaking one shows a huge lapse in judgement and can prevent you from being promoted or you can lose a rank and pay.   
So it's like getting a work place demotion.   You don't go to jail for every article.   Hardly any really.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kinda fitting since he bought the rights to the story he based the first film off of four about that much. 

Not sure if people down voted because it sounded like I was making some kind of insult.   He literally bought the rights to a Japanese story that he based the original screen play off of for next to nothing.   The director had recently tried to kill himself and didn't give a shit.   This is back when the original story was pretty much a copy of the Japanese version.   R2d2 and c3p0 were bumbling human assistants to princess Leia and Luke was a general in the rebel army.   His brother darth led the other sides army.   Jedi were Jedi-bindu and led by mace windy.   Oh and there was no force.   Just crystals that enhanced people's abilities.   Pretty cool story actually.  I'm paraphrasing.   It changed a shit load of times.   Sometimes main mace the main character some times adding a general obi Wan and sometimes darth is more of a ruler.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What??  There is no "proper channel to the public".  Why would you discuss company matters with the public?   Not every revelation  is relevant to the average Joe.   Whistle blower programs are so you can tell on your boss or anyone really, through use of proper channels so it doesn't become a libelous mess.  

The snowden stuff is in a completely different ball park.   Not things like, my boss is bypassing quality checks to meet schedules or 25 percent of losses were not reported quarterly to boost department effectiveness ratings.    </TEXT>
