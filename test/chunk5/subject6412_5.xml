	<TEXT> I was wondering if anyone who has steam (and the game) would like to be my coop partner for Rise of the Tomb Raider's endurance mode so we could get the achievements for the gamemode. We'll have a good old time doing it.

Either add me up on steam at this link: steamcommunity.com/id/76561198002524748

Or 

Leave me your steam id and other information in the comment section </TEXT>
