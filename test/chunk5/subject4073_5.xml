Yeah I think this sums it up pretty well. It's been entertaining on an episode by episode basis, but the long-term isn't looking so hot, and I think at a certain point it's going to slam into a wall and stop being fun instantly when there's no one fun left in like the F7. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know about thaaaat. Tell me who wouldn't vote for her out there right now.

I think the mistake you are making, and a lot of people on the sub make, is not being able to separate your own views of Debbie on TV and how other players feel about her. We've only ever heard positive things about Debbie from the other castaways (aside from the Brad incident). Cydney and Michele both called her motherly in KR, and now in this season, her and Sierra supposedly have a close alliance, Tai seems to have respect for her, Brad has forgiven her for the outburst and has repeatedly told her he loves her, etc. She's not as much of a goat as you think. </TEXT>

I was afraid for a while there that she was going to make the Michelle Schubert mistake of laying too low while the votes are coming for her. Is it possible to take the lesson she learned from her last season too far? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Debbie. Not sure what everyone's beef is with her, but you have to admit she managed to turn her game around this episode and reverse the huge mistake she made when she blew up at Brad. People have this weird insistence on hating Debbie but she's really entertaining to me. What makes her different from Phillip is that she's actually good at the game, and she actually has funny moments that aren't just her being delusional about her placement in the game. Idk I've just seen everyone praising Cirie for her performance in these two episodes (and rightfully so!) but Debbie played just as well. </TEXT>
