	<TEXT> There's three things that mean I don't *really* like Leeds:
1. When I was younger I worked in the catering at Vicarage Road, often in the away end. Leeds' away support were generally alright, apart from the inch of piss they left on the floor of the Vicarage Road end. Which is digusting. 
2. In the run up to the play off final in 2006. I seem to remember a ridiculous number of their supporters showing some hilarious big club arrogance and assuming they just needed to turn up and win. 
3. Because they stopped us getting promoted. Especially that little dickhead Dominic Poleon, who I'm delighted to see is achieving bugger all in league one after taking the piss out of Jack Bonham.

This particularly applies to supporters of the big clubs that have never really tasted failure.  I mean, the connection to the club comes from representing where you're from, the feeling of community in the stands, the epic away trips to
be one of a minority,  bellowing your lungs out to see the team home. You don't get that from sitting in a pub. 

Edit: that said, I feel for kids growing up supporting teams they can't afford to go and see.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Danny Mills absolutely tore him apart just before he was sacked. Whilst you can put some of it down to sour grapes, Mills' central point about Pearce's coaching seemed to ring true; in essence, there's only so long a manager can shout and holler without any kind of tactical skills before players work them out.

	<TEXT> There's two. Both destroyed Graham Taylor's legacy in under a season. 
First is Dave "Harry" Bassett. Appointed to take over from Graham Taylor, who'd led that club from fourth division to second in the first, a cup final and Europe, as well as consistent top ten finishes in division 1, Bassett destroyed the ethos of Taylor's team. He also played a much more basic route one game. He was sacked as the Orns were relegated, taking 12 years to return to the top flight,  again under GT

Second is Gianluca Vialli,  appointed to take over from a retiring Taylor,  who'd been unable to turn around a catastrophic loss of form that saw us miss the play offs having been top. Vialli was given a massive amount relatively to spend, which he wasted on rubbish like Ramon Vega and Pierre Issa. He was sacked as we subsided into midtable, and ITV digital went bust leaving us with no money. He then tried to sue the club. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not so much Oyston's refusal to invest his own money, as his refusal to invest the club's money in itself. Instead, it's been used to help his other businesses. 

Although Oyston might own Blackpool FC, it's not actually his money. They are a Ltd company, and a distinct entity. The way he's treated the club is disgraceful, frankly. 

Football clubs are in a strange position; they are community assets, rather than normal businesses. That's why they so rarely are allowed to go completely bust, despite being in a situation other businesses would never be allowed to get into. At the same time though, all clubs should aspire to at least break even each year. Unfortunately, the way the money is divided up - particularly in England (I can't speak of anywhere else) makes it almost impossible for anyone outside the Premier League. 

It's worth pointing out that until the early 80s all TV money (such as it was) was shared pretty evenly throughout the football league. That was then changed to favour the top clubs, and ultimately led to the formation of the Premier League. 

Of course, people will argue that they generate most of the wealth and so deserve the money - but the extra cash in the Premier League has inflated wages all the way down the pyramid, but without necessarily increasing clubs revenues to accommodate it. As a result, it's almost criminally expensive to have to watch some games in League One or Two (or even the Championship - 35 at Ipswich!) as clubs attempt to cover their costs.

And one final point, although some money flows to the football league as a "solidarity" payment, it's worth remembering that the PL threatened to stop this if the Football League clubs didn't play ball over the "reforms" to youth football designed to help Premier League clubs cherry pick the best youngsters at the expense of the rest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're both pretty unusual. As a fan of Saracens since 97/98 and a proper regular at Watford since the year before, off the top of my head, I can only think of one Sarries player getting a hattrick. Footballwise, I can think of Deeney, Ighalo, Chopra and Connolly all scoring them. That said we did go about 10 years without one (Chopra vs Burnley to Deeney vs Bournemouth) </TEXT>
