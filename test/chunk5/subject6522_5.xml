	<TEXT> Aww man you hit me with being self-centered. It's too late though. Already on my way to the event. Best I can do is to keep a low profile nalang. If it makes you guys better, I'm wearing black jeans and a white t shirt. If I need to blend in, I could just borrow a coat from a friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate people who just listen to mainstream music. I remember when Hotline Bling wasn't still a thing and made a friend listen to it, he initially hated it. But when the song became viral, I saw him dancing and playing it on his phone on repeat. He's still my friend but I resent him for that haha. Kids don't know that there's a lot of good music out there.. </TEXT>
