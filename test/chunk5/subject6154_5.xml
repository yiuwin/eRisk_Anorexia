	<TEXT>  *thats exactly what ive done here*

Except you **DIDN'T SAY** were "averages". That was literally the extent of my entire complaint - the information isn't implicitly wrong, but if you don't mention that these figures aren't absolute, stupid YouTubers are going to take them at face-value and not know enough to negotiate - and that is very dangerous.

 *because 99% of the time your email will be ignored or you are forwarded to basic contract.* 

Are you just pulling this number out of your ass? I've spoken with at least 12 separate MCNs over the years, and have never had any issue communicating with any of them. Every one of my YouTube peers has similar stories - e-mails, phone calls, contracts - negotiating is the norm in this space, not some rare specialty reserved for the elite. You criticized me earlier for using anecdotal evidence, but you're much more guilty of it here. Just because *you're* ignored doesn't mean everyone else will be.

 Your also assuming that every person can negotiate a contract or does speak English

No, I'm not assuming that at all. I'm just saying -- your article needs to allow the reader to MAKE THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS, and mention that these numbers **are not fixed**. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  sure you can negotiate most of the stuff 

That was my point! Just include that in the article! Or, at that very least, mention that your figures are only *averages* and not set numbers.

YouTubers NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED TO NEGOTIATE! It's really dangerous, and ignorant to simply take every contract at face value without ever trying to tailor it to your own needs. 

And, regarding Maker Gen - is that not a separate sub-group of Maker? Shouldn't they both be listed? If you're only listing one... Why not the parent company? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, my wife is going to love this news. Haha.

Still though, I'd prefer someone younger, less-known. Allow him to really play the character for many, many years. I fear Hardy is already much too established / famous to sign a contract beyond three films. Like Craig, he'll want to shop around and try other projects. Maybe it's selfish of me, but I want to see an actor that sticks almost-exclusively to Bond for a nice 7+ picture deal. 

But hey, Disney managed to get Robert Downey to do that many Marvel films, so maybe an arrangement like that is possible with Hardy. Did seem like his recent project-choices were gravitating towards heavier, Oscar-worthy roles (Child 44, Legend, etc.). I doubt he'll get any consideration as 007. Plus - if he's going to be the star of any franchise, I'd prefer it was "Mad Max". That series so much going for it right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Realistically, I don't know that the holodecks couldn't have inhabitable space larger than the original room itself. Vic Fontaine's Vegas showroom is a great example of what I believe would be its "true" limitations. Or, a bridge-simulation: all action takes place in a confined place. 

How does it account for movement across a distance greater than the room itself? Are their mini treadmill like devices keeping our characters in place? With forcefields, etc - such a setup is possible, but I'm curious how that'd look.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In that s7 episode of DS9, there are at least 20 live-bodies occupying a baseball field-sized holo-environment, all running around and playing baseball. But the holosuites at Quark's are, at best - 50 feet across at their widest. 

For a single individual, the emitters would continually update the surroundings based on the player's position - but how would it work when there's two or more people spread over large distances?

Looking forward to hearing some of your theories! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great question, Jay! (I should have known the most well-thought-out question would come from you, haha).

Honestly, no idea. Best case scenario: it works exactly the same as the dispute-level; wherein you have 5 days after the rejection to re-initiate the process with an appeal to keep the funds in escrow. Worse case scenario: the user doesn't get any revenue until after the entire thing is awarded in their favor with a successful appeal or counter-notification. 

On the plus side however, by virtue of the lengthy process itself, any lost-appeals will likely have come after a video has already seen its peak 'earnings window', so lost revenue in this scenario is likely to be much lower than a video during its first days of being uploaded. Plus, if YouTube claims only 1% of videos are disputed, I have to imagine the amount that gets appealed are probably 1% of that. And speaking anecdotally, my experience bears-out that maybe 1 out of every 5 disputes I make is rejected.  </TEXT>

3) Practice, research, and confidence. 

So, here's an example of "scripted", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq9WGpWwUBc

	<TEXT> I don't think these minor inconveniences are emblematic of the negative situation OP suggested in his so-called current state of YouTube. 

Sure, the occasional match claim occurs, or even rarer are situations like yours where it's a completely misidentified match - but in all instances, it takes a user just 30 seconds to initiate the risk-free dispute process and instantly restore their video's visibility and monetization on the site. 

"Luck" had nothing to do with it. The system is EXTREMELY reliable. In fact, to date - out of the billions and billions of videos upload, there hasn't been a single reported case of someone losing all three steps of the dispute-appeal-counter notification process unjustly. And indeed, it appears you only needed the first of the three steps to correctly restore your content. Anecdotally, of the 2,000+ claims I've received on my movie reviews... only 150 or so have made it to 'appeal', and only 2 required a counter-notification to be overturned. My win-rate is still 100% for all 2,000.

For what it's able to do - on such a large scale, the Content ID system isn't good - it's incredible. </TEXT>
