	<TEXT> Trump seems to have a tendency to always look awkward AF when in front of photo ops. He knows that people will pick apart his every mannerism, so it probably makes him nervous as shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guessing you're probably talking about the hippocratic oath? If so, I hadn't really thought about that, but it definitely sinks my original thought. 
For someone elected to an office with this much power, however, there should be exceptions, imo. They literally have lives in their hands. That's not really something I want someone to be in charge of, if they mentally unstable. Even in the slightest.


You are also right about many of the "successful" types having sociopathic traits. Pretty sure this idea also holds true regardless of ideologies. Still think it would be beneficial to have some insight to one's mental capacities when running for a position of stature. </TEXT>

Just a simple psych exam would have sufficed. Guarantee you Trump and many of his cronies are, fucking class A sociopaths.

It was one of those comments that anyone can really say that got lucky in it's timing (*Not to take away anything from the quality of the comment itself!*). It was a great one. Some get lucky, is all. Guessing OP would maybe agree. 

I commented just because I saw your comment and your parent comment and thought to look deeper. Saw that OP seemed legit, so I commented to that notion. It's always refreshing to see humility in action. Idk, maybe it's just me </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are absolutely right.
The poor man's idea of a rich man was directly from John Mulaney. The other two I've been using for a while, but I'm certainly not the only one who has said them.
Nevertheless, it never hurts to reiterate, especially when it so perfectly epitomizes everything about Trump.


As said by /u/JamesIgnatius27 himself. Which is pretty humble of him. It's not like he is trying to take credit for the 3-liner, rather it was just a perfectly fitting moment to use it. And pretty succinct one also, regardless of the moment.

All I know, is that what they decide (as  holds true with any other court within the judiciary) will hold validity based on their interpretations of the constitution. They are a court of law regardless, appointed by elected presidents (this may be what causes you pause with this court, being that 2 out of the 3 judges on the 9th were appointed by dem presidents).

This is the Eisenhower interstate map, so it's information is only accurate up to the 1960s. 805 is a bypass of 5, and wasn't completed until the 1970s.

	<TEXT> You're right, comparatively speaking, those measly murders ain't nothing compared to the horrific hyper violence witnessed tonight in Cali.

This is probably just a bunch of fake news, but in re to [Quebec..](http://www.salon.com/2017/01/31/classmates-say-suspected-quebec-mosque-shooter-loved-trump_partner/) </TEXT>

Fuck Trump and fuck cronyism. And fuck any hardnosed hardliner. So sick of people rehashing the same old shit based on the bullshit ideologies they have been spoon fed throughout their lives.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My pops loves these chips for some reason. Me.. yeah, not so "Calidad". I'm more of a "Santita's" fan, myself. Even better are chips that look like they were fried from real corn tortillas. Like those bags o' chips that are sealed with a twist-tie. Pretty common in a lot of mexican markets.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And the number of spineless "yes- men"  at Trump's disposal is showing Bannon that they are going to be able to get away with a lot of shit. 

And just to be clear, I see just about every mainstream politician as a kiss ass "yes man". Their "Pledge of Allegiance", rather than being a pledge to their country, is a pledge to their party first.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really hope they can get some good mileage out of all of the current support coming their way.

It has become readily clear to me (despite all my hopes against it being so) that Trumps regime truly does not give a fuck about the majority. All of our voices, sadly, are falling on deaf ears in his circle. It really is, as if this is all perfectly choreographed to piss as many people off as possible.  </TEXT>

One of the reasons the book is a great read. It's relatively short and a pretty easy read, making it super approachable. Yet, the implications that are laid out within are timelessly far reaching. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. I am so sick of feeling that I live in the the United States of Amnesia. There is so much shit that history can afford to teach us, but we often seem to not care enough to remember. 

We, as the diligent, need to always research, remember and remind the amnesiacs.

	<TEXT> Oh, ok. I have a helluva time trying to discern sarcasm online, sometimes lol.

And you aren't alone in how you feel about all the garbage that is going on right now. It is *really* bad, and I fear that it is only going to get worse. The totalitarian nature of it all is getting pretty fucking real. Much more so now, than I can ever remember. </TEXT>
