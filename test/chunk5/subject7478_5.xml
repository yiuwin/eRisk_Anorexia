	<TITLE> [Spoilers Aired] I miss the charm, mystery, and romance of Season One </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-29 05:33:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We're three episodes into Season 2, and I'm really missing Season 1.

What initially drew my interest in the novel/show was 1) Time travel, and 2) Early-modern life of the Highlands.

When I first heard there was going to be a show based on the novels, I was skeptical. I thought it was going to be shit, frankly.

But thankfully, I was very wrong.

Season 1 had all of the: charm, mystery, intrigue, and romance of the novels. Not only that, but the TV show is *very* addictive.

Other than The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, I can't think of another show that aired in recent years that is as addictive as Outlander Season One.

I don't think there was a single episode in the first season that bored me. Tuning in was always a joy.

Season 2 has been..a bit of a bore. 

Pre-revolutionary France just isn't as appealing to me as the Scottish plots.

This isn't a knock against the show; it's still good..just not as addictive to me at the moment.

I know the show is just following the novels' plots. The French plot of DiA bored me as well.

[Spoilers DiA](/s "I know we're going to return to Scotland, and I'm just waiting for that.")

I miss the people, places, and scenery of Season One. I miss the mud and grime of the Highlands over the pomp of Paris.

End rant. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Spoilers All] Realistically, won't there have to be major changes (relative to the books) in any upcoming seasons of the TV show? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-25 19:09:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sorry if this has been discussed on this subreddit before, but won't there have to be *major* differences between the books and the show as we move forward (and assuming the show gets a 3rd season)?

I believe in the 3rd book there is a 20 year time jump, something like 1746 to 1766 when Claire goes back.

How do you think the show will handle this?

I think there may be a time jump, but it won't be 20 years (or else they'll have to recast the entire show!). Maybe a 3-5 year jump.

How will they handle Brie?

I'm hoping some of the people who die in the books, Murtaugh and (EDIT: Rupert ~~Robert~~), don't die in the show.

I really hope they don't kill of Murtaugh.

I'd be fine with major differences in the show, and that's what I expect.

What are your thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is just such a fun and great show!

The writing, acting, and directing is fantastic in *every single* scene.

Every other show on the air...at some point in the episode I reach for my phone when a scene loses my attention (ex: with Danerys/any of the Starks' scenes in GoT, or Nina Krilova's scenes in The Americans).

Both fantastic shows, but not every scene/plot is interesting.

On this show...every scene is great. The last show that had me glued to every scene was Justified (well, excluding Eva's prison plot in season 5). 

Kudos to everyone involved: writers, directors, actors, and especially the head of casting.

It has been such great ride, and I can't wait till the finale next week! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Of course, this is also why it might be completely made-up since that's a pretty easy idea for anybody to come up with and then just describe a vehicle that fits the description and wait for the audience to conclude the same thing.

I agree with you, but this particular case is from 1967. 

I think Emmerich and Devlin's Stargate must've been inspired by the Ancient Aliens hypothesis, which has existed for a long time, but became very popular in 1968 with the release of Chariots of the Gods?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_the_Gods%3F

It seems these Triangle UFO cases have existed for a long time.

I believe so.

 but instead of a giant black triangle an older gentlemen described what he saw as a giant black rectangle.

Most of the people involved in this case described the UFO as a triangle, but perhaps at certain points in time (and different vantage points) people might've described it as a rectangle.

	<TEXT>  the likelihood of a brokered convention at this point is very high.

This depends on whether Kasich can pull off the Ohio win. It looks like it's going to be close.

 it makes a lot more sense for the Republicans to simply change the rules as they enter the convention and deny him a nomination that way instead of pushing a third party vote.

So much of this drama could have been avoided if these "Winner takes all delegates" rules hadn't been in place.

It's absolutely going to be an interesting convention. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A 3rd party bid (by a strong Republican candidate) would split the GOP vote, and lead to a HRC win.

Would the GOP put forth a 3rd party candidate to "Lose the presidency, but save the party"? (And stick it to Trump)

(Assuming the general consensus is that Trump would be harmful for their House/Senate positions)

If so, who could this 3rd party be? Jeb?

Rubio/Cruz/Kasich all said in their last debate that they'd support Trump if he won the nomination. Do you think they'd keep their word? </TEXT>
