That almost makes me want to support removing the rule then. That somewhat refutes the argument that this sub, or at least it's mods, are left leaning though, since left leaning mods would want to popularize posts about BLM getting abused, since that (properly framed) would bring about sympathy and make them seem like they're right, fighting against tyrants who abuse them and beat them up.  

The fact remains, you're not going to find many takers to the idea that it doesn't break one or both rules. Unless you're taking the stance that there was no assault at all and the cops were entirely in the right, which I think would be a pretty unpopular opinion here, the rule broke either rule 4 or rule 9, possibly both. </TEXT>

Think like a mod for a moment and you'll see how impossible that is. The perception of bias on reddit is pretty much as bad as real bias. On /r/politics, on /r/news, and on many other subs, there is a huge perception of biased based on some case by case decisions that have been made and it's stuck around. Case by case exceptions can't be made because then people think the mods have and are pushing an agenda outside of the posted rules. </TEXT>

If you'd ever been a mod on a big sub, you'd know that the only way posts get removed is if they get seen by a mod, or if they get reported. Due to general apathy, the latter may only happen after being seen by quite a few people, and there's usually a time delay between a post being up and being popular, and then before it gets reported, and finally before a mod sees the report and acts. </TEXT>

If you're going to blatantly lie, you should really smarter than to do it somewhere where the actual facts aren't staring you right in your face from the sidebar.   
If you honestly don't think the original post (not this one) broke any rules, and the mods were wrong to remove it just because of that, then you didn't read the rules. Of all the comments I've seen going after the mods, this is the stupidest because it is easily provable as being utterly false.   

Also, Reddit has never been a place where the entire purpose has been users deciding content, at least not since the very early days. Mods have been setting rules to run their subreddits for much longer than the three years I've been here. This very clearly broke the sub rules, and the rule is hardly some agenda laden biased trap (compared to say the rules of T_D). </TEXT>

As I've said in other comments, people who've modded a large sub knows that the /r/videos mods did the right thing in that mods cannot start making exceptions to rules. Rules only work when there are very limited avenues to claim bias, both in how the rules are written (straightforward, clear, and unbiased) and how they are enforced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to have to disagree with the other two people who replied to this. While I definitely think you should work to get rid of the redundancy if/when you rework the rules, I think a rule needs to be kept in place against p2p (person to person) violence (as in in-person fights).    
This sub shouldn't become a bum-fights sub, nor should it be overwhelmed with cop videos or other types of assault videos, and that's what would happen without such a rule.   
Setting up flairs and filters on the sidebar IMO is not a viable solution. Not only is it restricted by the sidebar size limit (I'm not sure how close you are, but from what I can see, my guess is pretty close), but it's also a really clumsy method. When there is a massively overwhelming amount of filtered content too, it essentially breaks the flow/page unless the user goes to further pages or has an addon like RES. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stop for a second, just stop. Put yourselves in the position of a mod of a sub. Now think of a rule that 99% of the time is going to be reasonable, written in a way that is unlikely to bring about claims of bias or unfairness. Now a totally unexpected post occurs and you are called to make an exception, can you do it?   

Your way of thinking very clearly pegs you as someone who has never modded a sub, at least not a sub of any particular size or importance. Subs only work when the rules are the rules and exceptions aren't made, especially when it is impossible to know whether the exception being asked for is "legitimately" a breaking news story or not until it's too late. It just doesn't work. </TEXT>

Sub rules are (often) written the way they are to minimize the ability for, and the ability to make an accusation of, bias. To do that, the rules have to be straight forward and as objective as possible, both as written and to enforce. If mods start making exceptions then it becomes very bad very quickly. </TEXT>

**Hypocrite**  
noun  
1.
a person who pretends to have virtues, moral or religious beliefs, principles, etc., that he or she does not actually possess, especially a person whose actions belie stated beliefs.  
2. 
a person who feigns some desirable or publicly approved attitude, especially one whose private life, opinions, or statements belie his or her public statements.

Number one doesn't apply because they aren't claiming any virtuous, moral, or religious beliefs, and the only principles they claim to be upholding are the rules as written, which they are in fact upholding, as evidenced by the outrage here, specifically based on them upholding their principles, and the fact that they are allowing rule abiding posts, such as this one.      
Number two doesn't imply because again, they aren't feigning an attitude, and I can't speak for you or anyone else, but I don't really know or care what /u/Meepster23 and the rest of the mods do in their personal life, unless of course it's fun and they're just not including us.

	<TEXT> Nor should it. Sub rules, especially for large subs, only work when they are as clear as possible with as little wiggle room as possible. That decreases (but unfortunately does not eliminate) accusations of bias and makes any accusations easier to refute.   
Notice how the people complaining about the rule are pretty noticeably floundering to come up with examples where the rules haven't been enforced on submissions large enough to get reported or noticed to the mods as rule breaking, leaving complaints about a few tiny posts and some really old (including before the rule) posts that weren't caught and removed. </TEXT>

In a civilized society, the government is better suited. What you're thinking about, and apparently wanting, is called anarchy or mob rule. Read a history book, it doesn't work so well. If the government is doing a bad job of it then that's a different issue and pressure should be (as it currently is being) brought to bear to change that. It doesn't justify vigilantism though.   
And, again, they have zero right to privacy to begin with

	<TEXT> Honestly, what else could they do? Reddit explicitly lays out that that mods run their subs and that the admins won't intervene except in the most extreme situations (which usually end up with the sub banned or put behind the wall).   
Furthermore, the admins can't set the precedent of undermining a sub for actually enforcing its rules on what's **not** allowed to be posted, even if it does so in an unpopular/bad way, since that would entirely destroy the idea that subs can set their own rules (within reason) and determine what content is allowed in each sub. That's why the times when the admins have cracked down, it's on subs allowing things they shouldn't, not disallowing things they, arguably, should. </TEXT>

Moderators see posts that need modding in one of two ways, either they see them themselves, either because they're browsing /new or they get popular enough to show up on the front page of the sub where the moderator notices them, or the posts gets reported for violating the rule and the moderator sees it that way. If neither of those happen, the moderator doesn't see the post and it doesn't get removed.   

Now, those basic facts explained, Occam's razor says that it is far more likely that those posts that were left, the ones that didn't pre-date the rules, as other comments have explained, were just missed, not purposefully ignored because of some grand conspiracy or because of bribery.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A bit off the topic at hand, but in the US that hasn't been the case for select commodities for a long time. In the name of stability, the government subsidizes, price fixes, and even legally forbids farmers from growing certain crops (they also incentivize farmers to grow or not grow certain crops).    
The reasoning is that price swings would create issues where one bad year, either because of failed crops or low demand, could force farms out of business and the supply wouldn't be there for future years, creating huge price swings and large scale economic calamity.   
The stupidity comes when the government pays to buy excess product, pays farmers not to grow product, or fines them for defying quotas. Besides being unethical and immoral, it is also a waste of taxpayer funds. </TEXT>

The same can be extended to El Salvador, Honduras, and the other countries that these people are coming from, regardless of our past history in those countries.   
Also, the people who are fleeing would otherwise be the most motivated to create change, so allowing them to illegally enter the US hurts these countries and essentially gives a win to the gangs. </TEXT>

Unless Greenpeace and by extension you, are positing that is the company's responsibility to make sure that the products they sell are packaged in a way that is recyclyable in that country, which is a laughable notion, I'm not sure what the expectation is. A requirement for recyclability would de facto ban non-fountain sales in many of the third world/developing countries outright and restrict it to cities in many others,  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, and it's a waste of resources, but it would make people feel better so there is still a push for it. </TEXT>
