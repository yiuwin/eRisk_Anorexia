	<TEXT> To be fair, learning German is probably a bit gratuitous for you, isn't it? I never had problems understanding Dutch who made a bit of an effort to communicate with no knowledge of Dutch whatsoever. (It may help, though, that I'm from the North. Even not speaking Low German it helps to put on an exaggerated regional accent in order to be understood by Dutch, I was told) :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During the Cold War, from a Western perspective, sure  but we've moved on, haven't we?

I must say, I've always loved the many levels of bizarreness of domino theory. "Oh fuck, those dirty commies' innocent neighbours might get a glimpse of what communism is like  we must intervene!" </TEXT>
