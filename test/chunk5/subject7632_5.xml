	<TEXT> Zubat used to be my most common as well :)

They changed spawn variations after around the 3rd or 4th month, I think.

Don't get me wrong. Onix and Charmander ARE rare for me, but in terms of variation, that's how little variation I have at home.

I've evolved at least 3 or 4 Nidoking and 3 or 4 Nidoqueen so far and none of them with great movesets. </TEXT>

Imagine Snorlax is your buddy and a Dratini spawns right where your buddy is. You'll never see it under him and you won't catch it. Some people might like your suggestion, but EVERYONE will be upset if they lose a rare spawn because of something silly like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in a desert biome. As I understand, there's more than one variation of the desert biome.

-----

In my experience, my "desert" biome is usually (roughly in order from most common to least common):

**most common**: Nidoran M / Nidoran F / Ekans

**very common**: Sandshrew / Geodude / Cubone

**uncommon**: Rhyhorn / Growlithe / Zubat / Machop / Mankey

**rare**: Charmander / Onix / Ponyta

**very rare**: Kabuto / Hitmonchan / Hitmonlee

I hope your post gets more attention because biomes are one of the concepts in PoGo that really interest me and will help to find the few I'm missing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Add a CP range. +/- 300 CP. That way you can't give overpowered pokemon and instead need to TRADE to get them. Traded pokemon cannot be transferred for candy and cannot be over the trainer level cap. That simple.

Hey there :)

So, despite me enjoying your post, I came here to argue with you because I'm an asshole. As you said, a lot of people have their own thoughts about trading. Mine differs with yours in one way:

I disagree with the CP range. I personally think there should be no restriction on what difference in level or CP the other Pokmon is, as long as both players can see both the Pokmon and agree to the trade before it happens. Imagine you actually were to trade a Snorlax for a Pidgey. It would be almost impossible for you to get a good Snorlax from a perfect IV Pidgey. And someone who has 25 Snorlax actually might want a perfect Pidgey.

In a better example, someone with multiple Snorlax might literally only need Grimer to complete their Pokdex but a person with multiple Grimer might only need Snorlax to complete their regional Pokdex. Why would I trade my extra rare Grimer for a 500 CP Snorlax?

Anyway, just a thought.

EDIT:

 Simply let us discard eggs.

I disagree. Niantic will never do that. The point is to walk the eggs off so you're ABLE to get new eggs. Without the walking, this is just any random RPG.

 Choice of evolutions

I kinda agree. I just don't understand why Niantic didn't keep the Evolution Stones from the original games and let you buy or find them. Sure, they would be an extra space in your bag storage, but I also don't understand why they didn't make Storage compartments like all the later games. Imagine instead of 250 slots, you had 100 for balls, 100 for potions, etc. That would have even given them an opportunity to sell slots for more compartments. I feel like they hit a miss with that one.

Sure, there's lots of evolution requirements that will be difficult to implement, but that's where they could have done the random or choice evolution.

 Combine potions

I disagree. This seems a bit unecessary. I get the frustration. But that's part of the game. That's like saying don't spawn Rattata. Spawn Dratini instead. You get 50 Potions because they're common and you get 1 Max Potion because they're rare. That's how it works.

 TRAINER BATTLES

I highly agree. I don't even care if there's no reward. Just being able to battle a friend would be a great addition to the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Problem is, this may be flagged as suspicious behavior by Niantic and if you get permanently banned because of it, I'm pretty sure it won't be worth getting the regionals (or one of them).

Otherwise EVERYONE would be doing this.

You're free to do it, but you're breaking at least two rules:

* Logging into more than one device with the same account. This can result in a temporary or permanent ban.

* "Spoofing" your location. This can also result in a temporary or permanent ban. (I know technically you aren't spoofing, but if you're in place 1 at 11:35 and you're suddenly 1000 km away at 11:38 on the same day, it will almost definitely be flagged as spoofing) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, before Rhydon and Golem became awesome, I was stuck with a terrible area.

My commons are Sandshrew, Geodude, Rhyhorn, Nidoran M, Nidoran F, Ekans, etc.

I occasionally find Onix, Growlithe, Machop, Zubat, etc

And much more rarely, Charmander... And Pidgey. In fact, Pidgey is so rare in my area, that I'm almost always sure that a Pidgey is actually a Ditto.

Anyway, now that my Rhyhorn and Golem are actually awesome, I'm quite happy with my ability to power them up with candy easily. Just the stardust collecting always sucks. </TEXT>

Thanks for the response, but this is not a spinning circle or "false blue" thing. This is simply when the Pokstop does not acknowledge the swipe at all. As in there is no loading or processing of any kind apart from the spinning animation. It doesn't say "Try again later" or anything. When I swipe it 5 seconds later, it gives me items normally. Indicating that it never even tried to communicate with the server. </TEXT>

I have had it happen when I was just walking as well. But obviously in that case, exiting and retrying the Pokstop isn't a problem.

Next time I experience this, I'll check my journal. But most of the time, I've been able to swipe it again and still got the items which means I didn't get them the first time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it's not the speedlock because it works immediately after that if I exit it and try again. Also, the Nearby/Sightings tab shows Pokmon.

Plus, if it was the speedlock, it would say "Try again later" or something. It does not react at all when I swipe it.

I also don't think it's lag, because it doesn't even show the spinning white Pokball. (I'll add that to the post now to clarify) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've noticed in the last month or so, Pokstops open when I click on them, then when I swipe, the Pokstop shows the spinning animation but nothing else happens - even if I spin it again while I'm on it. It doesn't even show the spinning white Pokball. Only if I exit the Pokstop and come back to it, does it work. This happens about 30% of the time for me.

This isn't really too much of an issue if you're walking (other than being annoying), but when I'm actually a passenger at under 40km/h, this is very frustrating because by the time you exit and retry, the stop is out of range.
Anyone else experiencing this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I'll check the "has-tabs" thing when I'm able to :)

 It sounds like your project is setup incorrectly. Have you tacked tabs onto an existing project? It might be easier to just recreate the project using the tabs template.

Unfortunately, yes, we had to add tabs after the project was already a completed beta. To completely restart it and copy everything across to a new project might not be possible right now. That's why I'm asking if there's a better way to handle these little problems as almost everything is working and it might be quicker to fix the small problems. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [question] Using default ionic tabs, is there a way to NOT let the tabs block any of the page content? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-12 09:34:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a beginner with AngularJS and Ionic.

We've been asked to edit a project because a client insists on using tabs instead of buttons etc for navigation.

However, using the ionic tabs has proven to be a bit difficult because the tab bar (by default) is blocking some content on the page. We've tried to account for this by using padding etc, but the problem is that the tabs display at the top of the page for Android and the bottom of the page for iOS. Using padding on both top and bottom makes the page look messy with blank spaces.

Surely there's a simple property or something that makes the tab bar NOT block anything?

i.e. the content only displays adjacent to the tab bar and not under it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The lump </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-03 22:30:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I slept over at a friend's house. There was no space on the beds so I'm sleeping on a foam mattress on the floor. I hate sleeping on the floor. There's insects and who-knows-what that might be crawling on me while I'm asleep. I tossed and turned every time I heard a buzz or a creak or a click of any kind. It might have been in my mind. At some point I must have gotten too tired to care because I fell asleep.

I woke up feeling well-rested, although I felt a stab of panic when I noticed a small lump on my arm. It was just above my elbow. A little too big to be a mosquito bite but a little too round to be anything else I knew. It hurt a little when I touched it. I checked it again a little later in the day and I swore it had gotten a little bigger. It didn't seem to hurt any more than before. Hopefully it would go away. 

I got into the shower before going to bed. The lump below my elbow was starting to get even bigger! Wait... wasn't it above my elbow earlier? I started to panic a little now. What the hell bit me? I cleaned carefully around it. It hurt much more now. I thought about going to the doctor in the morning. 

After my complaining, I got my own bed in my own room this time. I hadn't shown anyone the lump but I was having trouble moving my arm without wincing in pain now. The lump near my elbow... was now much nearer to my palm! I had to cover my own mouth to avoid yelping in surprise. I checked it and knew I'd have to go to the doctor in the morning. Definitely. I tossed and turned again for a bit. Again, at some point, I must have fallen asleep. 

I jerked awake and saw that it was still dark. Oh my God! The pain! The lump on my hand and wrist was now so massive that I couldn't move without crying. I was sobbing quietly, thinking of how to drag myself to the light switch so I could see what was happening. But wait... I could hear something... Something faint that almost sounded like whispering or chittering. Something that was coming from the lump in my arm. Suddenly I felt searing pain and I knew. Something didn't bite me. Something was inside me. It was growing and now it was coming out. It was starting to tear my skin from the inside. It was going to come out of me and I couldn't even see it in the pitch black room. But it didn't matter because I started to black out from the pain. Just as I felt the warmth of blood on my hand. Just as I felt something rather large crawling up my arm towards my paralysed face and my open mouth. </TEXT>
