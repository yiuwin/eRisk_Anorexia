	<TEXT> A housewife takes a lover during the day, while her husband is at work. 
Not aware that 9 year old son was hiding in the closet. 
Her husband came home unexpectedly, so she hid her lover in the closet.
The boy now has company. 
Boy: "Dark in here." 
Man: "Yes it is." 
Boy: "I have a baseball." 
Man: "That's nice." 
Boy: "Want to buy it?" 
Man: "No, thanks." 
Boy: "My dad's outside." 
Man: "OK, how much?" 
Boy: "250."

In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the mom's lover are in the closet together.
Boy: "Dark in here." 
Man: "Yes, it is." 
Boy: "I have a baseball glove." 
Man: "That's nice." 
Boy: "Want to buy it?" 
Man: "No, thanks." 
Boy: "I'll tell." 
Man: "How much?" 
Boy: "750." 
Man: "Fine."

A few days later, the father says to the boy, "Grab your glove. Let's go outside and toss the baseball!" 
The boy says, "I can't. I sold them." 
The father asks, "How much did you sell them for?" 
The son says, "1,000." 
The father says, "That's terrible to over-charge your friends like that. That is way more than those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess."

They go to church and the father alerts the priest and makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and closes the door.
The boy says, "Dark in here." 
The priest says, "Don't start that sh*t again." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A little boy walks into his parents' room to see his mom on top of his dad bouncing up and down. 
The mom sees her son and quickly dismounts, worried about what her son has seen. 
She dresses quickly and goes to find him. 
The son sees his mom and asks, "What were you and Dad doing?" 
The mother replies, "Well you know your dad has a big tummy and sometimes I have to get on top of it to help flatten it."
"You're wasting your time," said the boy.
"Why is that?" asked his mom, puzzled.
"Well when you go shopping the lady next door comes over and gets on her knees and blows it right back up." </TEXT>
