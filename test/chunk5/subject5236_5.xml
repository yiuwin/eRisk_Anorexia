	<TEXT> Currently in the last quarter of my senior year of HS. Honestly I would do extra curriculars and give a shit. I didn't do either and now I'm realizing my huge mistake. I could have have finished of with a 3.6+ GPA because I know I'm smart, I just didn't care. Now I'm facing 2.7 GPA because of my shitty work ethic and otherwise lack of motivation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, whatever. What I was originally saying is you took something he said, out of context for that matter, and twisted it around to argue against something he never claimed. He said he tried other drugs other than weed and never got addicted to those drugs, he never said he wasn't addicted to weed. Just stop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Difference is he has no chance of dying with too much weed. He's an adult who can make his own choices, and those choices aren't gonna kill him or ruin his life. And if he decided to quit, it's could be difficult because it's taking away a habitual activity, but other than finding something else to do with his time, it won't be hard. Thinking somebody is a "reefer addict" is an uneducated assumption because nobody is physically addicted to it. It's like eating. If you eat out of boredom it will be difficult to do other wise, but you're not physically addicted to donuts. I don't know why you care whether he's addicted or not because he seems like a responsible adult with a job who likes to puff, and not some crack addict detriment to society. </TEXT>
