And, actually, I was discussing, in theoretical terms, about assembling an "Edge World" block, sort of a caucus of smaller worlds on the fringes of the galaxy, looking to raise their profile.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For things like "Snacks and drinks tonight at the Alderaanian senator's office. Come by and meet your old friends and new faces. Tonight, 2000"

I was thinking that US Central Time could be used. (In the interest of full disclosure, this is my time zone, but my motive is not selfish...mostly)

I was thinking because, since most of us are likely from the mainland US, it would be a good common point of reference, since 2000 Central is 7PM Mountain and 6PM Pacific and 9PM Eastern, so all within reasonable waking hours.

Plus, it's got the "C" needed to mean Coruscant. Like 2000 CT would be 8:00 PM US Central and 8:00 PM Coruscant Standard Time.

I removed the middle S/D since Coruscant probably doesn't have bullshit Daylight Savings Time.


Alternatively, we could use UTC, but, again, since most of us are likely from the US, it would mean anything that happens at night would be at midnight in-game. So, like an event at 8PM would be at 1AM UTC.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

I mean, if you're a senator and your planet hates you, well, you messed up." </TEXT>

Gannit paused. "That's what we call the area around Akiva," he said, making a circle with his finger. "We're the only habitable world in the region. Anyway, turns out whoever did his last service, instead of replacing the power cabling just taped it up. Well, when the tape wore out and the wires became exposed, it shorted out on the underside of the deck plating. From the looks of it, it was a 50/50 shot of short out or overload and boom. Fortunately, it was the better 50." </TEXT>

SUBJ: Greetings from Akiva

MESSAGE: Greetings from Gannit Valeris, the Senator from Akiva. I apologize not introducing myself in person, but I am having an open-door office session at the moment, as well as working on design and decoration ideas for my office. As an owner of a starship repair service on my world, and having a goal of increasing trade to my world, my company has a great need for starship parts. I have heard of the world Raxus Prime, a world of starship parts. I am not sure if the world is real or legend, but if it does exist, I may be interested in working out a trade deal. If the world is only of legends, I apologize for wasting your time and allow my to buy you a drink at Space Nate's to apologize.

Many thanks, and have a pleasant day.

-Gannit Valeris, Senator for Akiva </TEXT>

Gannit Valeris had yet to decorate his new office, aside from the three simple folding chairs in front of his desk that he had borrowed from the Senate storage room. That and he wasn't sure what sort of theme he would want. Akivan? Coruscanti? He'd decide later. He hadn't even hired an aide or staff yet.

For now, he's leave the door open and see who decided to drop by. </TEXT>

Which, all things considered, isn't saying much. We do get traders and the like in, though. Enough to keep things going, not enough to make anyone rich. If we got traffic like Coruscant did, the planet would collapse under the weight of the ships. I'm here just to raise our profile and make Akiva a bit more attractive to travellers and traders. Maybe drum up some Outer Rim outposts for the Feds or the IBC or whoever. That's it, basically. You?" </TEXT>

"And, to be honest, I'm paying no mind to the Chancery or Vice-Chair elections until the final candidates are...finalized."

Gannit looks at the floor for a moment, realizing his small gaffe, then back to Frea.

	<TEXT> Name: Gannit Valeris (Gann-it Val-err-iss)

Sex: Male

Age: 42

Bio: Owner of a mid-sized starship repair chain on Akiva, he ran and was elected Senator of Akiva on the "outsider" ticket, by a margin of 82-20-8, ousting incumbent Senator Barthran Ferhs, a career politician who had long been serving his own interests over Akiva's, having run unopposed for the last five elections, and soundly defeating the Akiva Isolation Movement candidate, Yar Querris, a local prominent, and highly controversial, politician. 

Valeris promised to good by Akiva and make them proud, but also to do good for the galaxy, and to do his best to put Akiva, a backwater Outer Rim planet, on the map as a major trading post of the Outer Rim.

The day before swearing in, he handed off running the starship repair chain to his childhood friend and business partner, as a sign of his committal to serving Akiva in the senate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * 1) COD is always rather populous, but the older the game, the lower the pop. And each November, the pop of the prior game drops, since that's when the next installment releases.

* 2) Not sure. But the single player is kick-ass! And the Halo 2 Anniversary cutscenes are fucking gorgeous.

* 3) No idea.

* 4) No idea.

* 5) I know Titanfall and some other games have specific regional servers (e.g. North America, South America, Western Europe...) you can pick from, others are auto-assigned, so it varies by game.

* 6) No idea

* 7) No idea.

* 8) All of them are, but Halo 2 Anniversary is gorgeous on the one. It'll make you contemplate leaving your SO for it. It's that gorgeous.

* 9) Depends on where you are. In the US, it'll probably be $40-50; in Australia, it'll probably be $52,000 plus VAT.

* 10) No idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem!

I figure the Arcade (Guacamelee, StrikeSuitZero, etc.) are no more than about 5GB, so that'll be close to 100 games.

By default, everything loads to the external, so I have to manually move them to the internal, but it's easier (i.e. faster) to move a 5GB game than a 45GB one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also have a WD MyBook 4TB.

4TB / 60GB is 66.66, so, after formatting, say about 60 games.

And the 60GB is a "large" game (for the time being), so it'll probably be closer to 75-80.

Plus, the 500GB internal.


Personally, I put all the Arcade titles on my internal, and the retail hard copies (or retail GWG) on the external. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it would hurt it, necessarily.

I mean, any more, a lot of kids see PG-13 (if not R) movies that would be way worse than a Pixar PG-13 movie by the time they're 10. Or less. Back in 2004, not necessarily, but nowadays, yes.

Honestly, I actually think that if it was PG-13, it could allow some leeway with story development. </TEXT>

'#2 - Skyfall.

Both really capture the tone of the film in the music and lyrics. They also explore the more human Bond of the Craig-run, versus the womanizing, nothing-gets-to-him, borderline-superhuman Bond of the classic movies. </TEXT>

"Both Republicans and Democrats passed a temporary spending measure that will keep the government afloat (a move supported by a majority of Americans) through mid-December. After the bill was passed by a vote of 77-19, Cruz theatrically sought a roll-call vote but he was promptly denied by his fellow Republicans, many of whom shouted No! at the Senators request."
