	<TEXT> We had some wicked thunderstorms throughout the night too! It was like a monsoon when I looked out my window, haha. Our power flickered a couple times too so it kept waking me up and I didn't fully get to sleep until after 6am :/ 
But I ALWAYS feel horrible if I don't get enough sleep. My stomach is sour all day and I just feel off. But at best, I'll try to eat a couple bites of toast or a couple crackers. Sprite or clear broths help me, too. 
It sounds like you just didn't get enough rest and your anxiety is having fun with that :( The more you focus on feeling sick or your stomach, the worse it will get. You said you're at work, so try and just focus on doing stuff there and keep your mind occupied. You're gonna be fine, just get yourself through your shift, go home and relax. Take a hot bath or shower, watch some TV, and if you can, try a piece of toast or something.
You're gonna get through this and you're gonna be fine :) I've been there so many times and always feel better after a hot shower and some good sleep.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was 13 and told my mom I was pretty sure my brain was wired wrong. I wanted to die, I was drinking, trying all kinds of drugs, having sex, all the shit a 13 year old shouldn't be doing. Plus, my own mind was just a constant fucking nightmare. The shit I thought of, things I wanted to do, the highs were too fast for me to handle, then when the lows hit me I was done. I wanted death to show up and wrap his sweet arms around me. 
But she revealed she knew all along I was bipolar. Probably since I was 4 or 5. The night before my first day of 1st grade I stayed awake all night panicked about what I was going to wear that day. I never slept as a child, I became violent in a split second, I injured myself when I got upset, as well as others, and my imagination was a tad bit too colorful at times. Everyone (especially family) told her it was just a phase and that I'd grow out of it, so she humored them, hoping it was true.
My dad overdosed and died when I was ten. I was the one who found him. Ever since then, its been downhill. 
My mother is my best friend. My family abandoned us after my dad died. I have put this woman through hell, wrapped my hands around her neck, swallowed bottles of pills as she watched, but yet she stood by my side.
She took me to a psychologist at 13 and indeed, I was diagnosed as Bipolar I with rapid cycling. A year later, I tried to hang myself. That was my first (and only so far) psych stay. I was finally put on trileptal, which I remained on until 2013, when I went through a nervous breakdown due to a health crisis, and have refused every medication since. 
So, here I am, 23 years old and a complete psychotic mess. But hey, its my fault. I'm just tired of being such a burden. 
I'm just lucky to have my mother, I wish anyone dealing with this shit had someone as supportive and caring. I'm lucky she hasn't had my ass committed. 
Edit: Forgot to add my Father was bipolar and schizophrenic, I've read this shit is genetic, so yeah. Thanks, Dad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally feel you right now. I've had a cold that turned into bronchitis and tummy troubles for almost a week now. It's day 6 and I'm just now starting to feel like it's a normal cold or something and it's working its way out of my system. 
Just drink TONS of water and rest as much as you can. It's a pain in the ass but it will be over soon enough. We'll get through this! :)
Chicken broth, chicken noodle soup, toast, crackers, sprite, Pepto, cough drops, mints, Vicks, and ibuprofen are all things that have helped me so far. But drinking a lot of water will break up the mucous and phlegm and make it easier to expel. 
I hope you get over this quickly! This sub has truly been a lifesaver these past couple of days, everyone here is awesome. Best of luck!  </TEXT>

I live in central Ohio and the only thing I had heard of going around was a cold virus but like I said, the ER doc told me I was the fourth person he's seen just today with the same exact symptoms. I'm praying to god the worst is over and with the stuff for my asthma and the antibiotics that I'll be on the road to recovery lol I ate earlier and I've been a little crampy in my bowels but nothing like it has been the past few days. Plus, the crampy feeling is like, way lower in my bowels and not up by my stomach anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I haven't had that issue yet but I better knock on wood. It all feels like it's in my chest and I'm a smoker, so I kinda let it go too long. But the breathing treatment helped immensely and this inhaler should keep it that way, if I can quit smoking so much.
I really REALLY hate antibiotics for that exact reason, but the one they gave me is something I've taken a couple times before with minimal side effects, just some stomach pain for a bit then it goes away. I'm not sure if you're in the US but its called azithromycin, or a Z-Pack. It's a five day course but lasts up to ten days in your system. It's what everyone else took for this so hopefully it clears mine up too. 
I was actually pretty freaking hungry when I got home so I ate some ramen noodles and toast, so I'll be taking my first dose of the antibiotic here shortly. 
Thank you so much for all your responses, you have honestly helped me so much. You're so kind :) </TEXT>

They gave me a breathing treatment and sent me home with an inhaler, steroids, and an antibiotic. But the ER doc said I'm the third person he's seen today with this funky bronchtis/upper respiratory stuff that also has diarrhea and nausea. Guess our region got lucky and started spreading this stuff like wildfire :( I'm on day 4-5 so I'm gonna take my meds and a breathing treatment and hope this is almost over with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mind does the same thing :( But I've kind of learned that in those situations how to step back and rationalize a little. It's so hard sometimes but it does help me :)
Thank you for your kind words, it's incredibly comforting to have people who truly understand what you go through on a day to day basis. I'm in the first steps of everything and I know I've got a long road ahead of me but I will be happy again. I'm going to make sure it happens :)
It's funny you mention you would rather die than be ill or ingest anything that could potentially make you ill cause I say the same exact thing. I'm watching my cousin die of cancer and here I am, won't take certain medicines that could potentially make me a lot better, I won't eat, and my life is entirely consumed by thoughts of food and getting sick. When I truly think about it, I wonder if I should be put in a straight jacket and thrown in a padded room, haha. 
But I'm sure you're not going to get sick, especially if you haven't by now and had an appetite earlier. Usually, once food poisoning hits, it REALLY hits. If the buns were that bad when you ate them, and you ate quite a few, you'd definitely know by now :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am so sorry you're feeling this scared right now, but, just step back for a second and try to rationalize a little bit. 
Were you the only one who ate that specific thing during that meal? Is anyone else ill? How long has it been since everyone ate it?
Your story radiates so much with me right now. I'm in therapy, battling an eating disorder and refeeding syndrome, on a bunch of meds, I self harm, and I'm almost back down to 100lbs. So you and I both know what havoc anxiety, fear, and worry can wreak on us and our stomachs.
It sounds like you overate a little and that may have set the ball rolling. Having that thought of something maybe not tasting right or being nauseous in the back of your mind didn't help. 
Just try your absolute hardest to relax a little, maybe take a little walk and see if that helps, sip on some water, or find something distracting. You're not feeling sick so take solace in that. 
I really hope this passes for you and doesn't start to take over your life again. Everything is going to be fine, though. You just gotta remember to stay in control and try your hardest to quit worrying about the what ifs. YOU are in control, don't let anxiety take control.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for that. It makes a lot more sense now that you're explaining it in depth. Everyone I've ever been around who gets a cold feels like shit, but is able to eat normally and go about their daily activities as normal pretty much. I didn't eat a single bite of anything yesterday and I know that probably didn't help, but I was fine for a while after I ate the saltines earlier then it just hit me and I was like seriously? Can't I catch a break? I'm just really hoping that the worst is almost over, I rarely catch crap like this so I don't know how it really works. I hope the 3-4 day thing is true, although I know symptoms linger for up to 10 days. 
But thank you so much for taking time out to explain that to me :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm on day three of having a cold and my stomach has felt absolutely awful. Nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and stomach cramping. I've been drinking plenty of water but have only been able to eat some saltines today, absolutely nothing yesterday, and some chicken noodle soup with toast on Friday. Is this normal? The cold symptoms consist of scratchy throat, low grade fever, sinus pain/pressure, cough that is now producing thick yellow mucus, and just a general run down feeling.
My fianc just had this and had ZERO gastro symptoms and by day 4 it was starting to go away. 
What should I do? I feel awful and don't know whether I should go get checked out or just try and wait it out. I thought colds didn't cause gastro problems. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. 
I'm a female, 23 years old, and 110lbs. I'm currently on propranolol, prilosec, depo-provera shot, and have been taking ibuprofen every 4-6 hours the past couple days, along with using Vicks vapor rub. Existing conditions include paroxysmal tachycardia, IBS, endometriosis, and thyroid disorder. 
Note: I've taken ibuprofen daily for a while before this due to the pain from the Endo, so I'm pretty sure that's not it. This feels different.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please bear with me, and I apologize for the wall of text, but I'm literally at my wits end right now, I'm in tears, and have nowhere else to turn...
So, my fianc had that nasty cold virus thing all last week and still has a cough and is a little run down, but was over the worst of it in the first few days. All he had were cold symptoms, no gastro symptoms. But I still took every precaution in trying to not catch it, and after over a week of not showing symptoms, I quit worrying so much but still disinfected, washed my hands, etc.
I wake up on Thursday, didn't sleep worth shit the night before, and I have a sore throat and I was just generally run down. No appetite or anything. I was awake maybe three hours that day before I went back to bed until Friday. Woke up around NOON (should have known then) and I was a little more refreshed but my chest was tight, it kinda burned along with my throat, and I had a slight cough. I fucking knew then that I was done for, I had caught it.
Now, most people are probably like "It's a cold, not a stomach virus. You'll be fine." But when I catch the slightest thing, I may as well have the stomach flu too cause god does it feel like it. I've always been this way and I don't know why. 
Friday I had some chicken noodle soup and toast and was actually fine. Saturday I felt absolutely awful and was so incredibly nauseous all day that I couldn't even bear the thought of juice. Today, I felt maybe a little more energetic and am finally coughing up all the crap in my chest, so I ate half a pack of saltines with some chicken broth. I guess I should also mention I've had REALLY bad diarrhea for some reason, so my insides are all upset. 
It's almost 10pm here and I'm not nauseous per se, but my stomach doesn't feel all that great. The diarrhea hasn't stopped, either. I haven't taken an anti-emetic yet today so I'm trying my hardest to hold off but I'm terrified its just going to all the sudden hit me and I'm going to vomit. 
Why the hell can't I just catch a cold like a normal person? Why the f*ck does my stomach do this to me? On top of all the anxiety I deal with on a daily basis. 
I had been looking forward to spending time with my fianc this weekend but that went to shit. We really needed it, too. These past couple of weeks make me feel like I'm stuck in a loop of perpetual sickness and shittiness and I'm just depressed and feel like this is never going to end. Its only going to get worse. 
I know I have to eat or I will only make things worse but I literally fucking can't. I've been told the first 3-4 days are the worst but I'm just terrified. Tomorrow will be day 4...
Thank you for reading if you did, I'm just really scared right now and don't know what to do or where to go...
Edit: I should also add that I'm battling this basically medicine free, besides Vicks and ibuprofen, because my heart condition makes it impossible for me to take ANYTHING over the counter for cold, flu, or allergy. So, thats really not helping.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have had hyperthyroidism for over a year now, but my case is odd - it comes and goes without any treatment. I have nodules on both sides of my thyroid which they believe is causing all this. I refused medication and suffer the consequences. I'm stuck with paroxysmal tachycardia, I'm underweight and cannot gain weight, hair loss, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, just all the fun stuff that happens when your thyroid is in overdrive. 
I see a specialist for the first time ever on a couple weeks and suspect to have biopsies on the nodules and possibly talk about removing it.
My thyroid was fine for so long and I had dormant, benign nodules for years, then it just crapped out and I became gravely ill, all while refusing treatment until they would refer me to an endocrinologist (over a year later). 
There's hormone pills they can give you to help regulate your levels and from what I've read and been told, you can come off them after a while. But if you do have hashis, its an autoimmune disorder that could require a little more treatment. Don't immediately jump to the worst conclusion, thyroid issues and even nodules, are more common than you would think. Wait for the ultrasound and in the meantime, just educate yourself (especially on hashimotos disease) and write down any and all questions you might have for the specialist. 
I know the thought of removing an essentially vital organ is terrifying but, in the long run you could end up very ill if you don't treat it in the early stages. People without a thyroid live normal, healthy lives. They just have to take a pill every day :) 
Take care of yourself and I wish you the best of luck!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, IBS is really common, especially amongst people who suffer from anxiety. Don't freak yourself out too bad. I suffer from everything you described on a daily basis due to IBS, but you just have to find which foods or diet works for you, and your medical doctor can prescribe certain medications that help immensely. 
Don't lose hope or give up on yourself. You're not alone. I know its hard after a while to distinguish between hunger nausea, nausea from anxiety, or true 'I'm sick' nausea, but you've gotta try. Getting malnourished is bad news, and after a year, I've still not fully recovered from it. Don't let it get out of control. Being vegetarian has its benefits but you need to replace what you're not taking in anymore or you'll just get sick. 
Please consider seeing someone about these issues, there is hope and you deserve to get better. You'll totally get out of this rough spot, just don't give up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My fiance had some sort of cold or sinus infection all last week and the first part of this week, and low and behold, I'm now catching it. Sore throat, minor cough with a little phlegm, I have almost no appetite, kinda nauseated, low-grade fever, headache, fatigue, sinus pressure/pain, and post nasal drip.
I know antibiotics do not work on this type of stuff so I have to try and tough it out, but the thing is, I can't take any cold/flu medicine due to having paroxysmal tachycardia stemming from hyperthyroidism. 
My throat and chest are bothering me, the cough is getting worse, and I have no idea what to do or take besides ibuprofen, Tylenol, drink plenty of fluids, and rest. I've been eating chicken noodle soup, toast, and other bland foods, along with gargling with warm salt water. 
This really sucks, I feel awful. Is there ANYTHING out there that I can take to help me through this? Or anything I can do? 
Any help is greatly appreciated.

It might be worth getting checked out, if anything get some antibiotics for the laryngitis you mentioned in your previous post and see if you can get some anti-emetics to help with the nausea and uneasy stomach. 
I live in Ohio and the only thing people are catching around here is a cold or some kind of sinus infection. My fiance had it all last week and is just now getting over it (he started an antibiotic on the second day) but never had any gastro symptoms or loss of appetite. So far, my mom and I have not caught it and its been over a week, so I hope I'm safe. 
But I really really hope you get to feeling better. I feel for you so bad and can feel your frustration and anxiety just by reading your posts. It will pass, though. You'll get through this, just give it a little time and try to rest as much as possible. Hydrate and eat lightly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey at least you're trying to eat! Thats awesome, don't quit :) If it doesn't begin to pass maybe you should make a trip to your GP, they can prescribe anti-emetics if it persists or gets worse.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure once the gastro symptoms start, they start at their worst within the first day or two then start to calm down. Its highly unlikely you're going to v* at this point, don't worry :) Just make sure to drink plenty of water since you have diarrhea and stick to light, bland foods to give your tummy a rest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my favorites thats never really spoken of is One Hour Photo. God, he was so creepy in that movie and I loved it. He was so incredibly versatile with his roles.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really hope it starts to pass soon and you feel better. Every time I even catch a cold, its like I also have the stomach flu. Nausea, diarrhea, stomach aches, etc. I have a sensitive stomach so I always have nausea and what not, so I'm not sure if thats just the case for me or what. 
Maybe you have some sinus drainage and its going down into your throat and stomach and upsetting it. Have you tried anything like decongestants or sinus meds that would help it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He also suffered from bipolar disorder and was a recovering alcoholic. He battled some pretty strong demons and apparently the fight was just too much for him. R.I.P. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a Saint Bernard and live in an apartment, but I make sure mine gets his daily exercise. Even just a fifteen minute walk tires him out sometimes, it doesn't take much. Granted, they're lazy as all hell, but that's no excuse. He/she is probably going to have a lot of joint and skeletal problems if they really never exercise it. Kinda makes me sad :(  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I spent most of my time in the bathroom when I had a period, its normal unfortunately :( Just make sure you're drinking plenty of water and maybe try some ibuprofen, Midol, or a heating pad if you can get your hands on one.
I really don't think you're sick, anxiety about being away from home and having your first period without BC is a crappy combo (no pun intended) so just try to relax a little or do something to distract yourself. Don't focus so much on the car ride, you made it up there just fine and the way back will be just the same :) 
If you have diarrhea and you're worried about having to stop frequently or anything, try some Imodium. One tablet usually helps me but everyone is different. Just be careful cause it could work too well and make you constipated :P
I hope you feel better soon!  </TEXT>
