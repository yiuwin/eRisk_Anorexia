	<TEXT> For all The Shins fans here that may not know... Mercer's band that became The Shins was known as Flake and then Flake Music. I just discovered this a few months back and I'm hooked. Sadly, not every song is awesome but the CD "When you land here it's time to return" [which just got remastered](https://megamart.subpop.com/releases/flake_music/when_you_land_here_its_time_to_return) is incredible - check it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Shins are the only band I have ever listened to (this includes solo artists and other non "band" type of music like rap) where I literally never get sick of any of their songs. I keep waiting for the moment when a popular song like Australia comes on and I hit the next button. 

Still hasn't happened and I hope it never will. Top 5 life experiences seeing them live and high as shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not arguing the origin of the word rights. I'm not denying that if you looked up "rights" in the dictionary that it wouldn't prove your point. I understand what you are saying especially in regards to a social contract.

But what you are missing is that animals have the ability to live as do humans. And just because we want to kill the animal to eat it doesn't mean that we do so without potential moral consequence or without feeling the need to contemplate what it means.

Animals have brains. Animals exhibit emotion, communicate with each other and feel pain. Just because humans can decide that rights are a concept between humans doesn't wipe out the fact that animals have the same potential for compassion and understanding.

Again, I don't want to come off as a hypocrite. I eat meat. I just feel that when I eat meat, I do so to survive and because I can. But I never feel like because I am human, I can and should do so without any remorse or without identifying with another being.

I am also not judging you for feeling any different. I just think it is sort of narrow minded to assume that because we are the dominant specie that we should reap and pillage all of earth's resources without moral dilemma. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why don't you believe that animals have rights? I'm genuinely asking. In my opinion just because humans are more advanced doesn't give us more of a right to life. I do eat meat and I do wear leather and I do understand the choice I make when I do so. Maybe it is worse to strip animals of these rights when I eat them, but my opinion still stands. I'm just curious how one living being can feel that another living being is without the right to life? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course there are ethics to it. I agree that if you want it, get it but don't pretend there isn't a suffering side to the process.

This can be said for almost anything in our lives. I want money so I go get it. But that doesn't mean I don't have to sit in a cubicle and waste my life away to do so. That's my suffering.

You don't need to feel bad about the choices you make. But don't deny that they are in fact choices.

Also, haven't heard "candy assed" in a while. I appreciate your efforts in bringing that phrase back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I may be wrong but I believe leather is usually a by-product of meat slaughterhouses. In other words, usually animals aren't slaughtered just so you can have leather shoes and leather couches. They are slaughtered primarily for meat and then their hides also serve a purpose.

Don't get me wrong, the leather trade still is a driving force in killing animals, but again, from what I have read animals are not killed only for their hide to become leather. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Livestock are mainly for food. Although I know that if I ever went to a slaughterhouse I would never eat meat again, I justify it by the fact that eating meat sustains my life. I've tried to go without eating meat for a period of time and felt sick, low energy and always hungry.

With fur, there are so many alternatives that there really is no need to buy fur. I've lived in New England my entire life and I've never been cold if dressed appropriately. My outfits have never included fur. There are plenty of materials just as warm if not warmer.

Yes, the live skinning thing is real but obviously not true in all cases. But that should definitely factor in. I dare you (and not in bullying way) to watch a youtube video on this process. I think it will change your outlook.

As far as cages, I'm not a big fan of caging any animals which is why I spend an extra few cents on cage free eggs etc.

You are not a horrible person. You are at least asking the right questions.

I'm not a member of PETA or someone who throws red paint on fur coats (look it up if you don't get the reference) but I try not to cause unnecessary suffering in my life. I'm not perfect at it but with fur it seems like an easy choice.

Lastly, I saw a quote on a dog rescue sight once that stuck with me. It might make sense to you:

"Think occasionally of the suffering of which you spare yourself the sight."
