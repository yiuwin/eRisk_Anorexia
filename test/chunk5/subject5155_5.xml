	<TEXT> The individual nations within the EU are not an analog to the states within the US federal government. Here are a few important differences:

* In the US, the federal government imposes taxes on the states. The EU does not impose taxes on its member states.

* In the US, federal law supersedes state law. In the EU, this matter is [not as clear-cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_%28European_Union_law%29).

* The US is largely homogeneous across its states in terms of language and shared common culture. The member states of the EU are quite heterogeneous, with many countries differing in language, culture, historical heritage, etc.  </TEXT>

1.2. Yeah, BF sucks. It caters to noobs because you can turtle up to imp and then spam paladins. Boring.

2. That might be helpful for noobs -- go build it.

3. That's a very controversial suggestion. I personally have never had any issue with map movement, and I haven't heard that complaint voiced. This might just be one of those things that you gradually get used to. Perhaps also adjust your scroll speed?

	<TEXT> Generally speaking, being a soldier in a country with a weak economy (no offense) is a bad deal. The pay is not good, and usually, it also doesn't give you a lot of opportunity to develop further skills. 

What I would try to do is to gain some expertise in some field that you can market via the internet. Alternatively, you can try to market your local (Portuguese) expertise via the internet. The key here is that marketing via the internet allows you to try to sell products/services to clients in wealthier countries who will have no problem paying you very well (by Portugal standards).

Here's a loose list of ideas to give you some inspiration. Note that most of these ideas are "small business" ideas designed to provide some income, but not to grow to huge scale.

* You mentioned that real estate in Lisbon is very expensive. Go to all real estate brokers in the area, get all their listings. Create a website containing all real estate listings in the area. (Make sure you don't break any laws in publishing this data.) Sell faster access to readers, or sell promotions to real estate brokers.

* If you're good at video games or you're an entertaining guy, stream via Twitch.TV or upload videos to YouTube for some passive advertisement dollars. This option is not so good because it doesn't let you build other skills.

* If you have access to a good camera, travel out to the tourism spots of Portugal. Take good pictures, write some comments. Upload this to a website. Advertise your website on the internet -- hopefully you can build a resource for tourists looking to go to Portugal. Make money off advertisements, or sell in-detail guides or tours.

* Teach yourself to code (there are lots of great resources, e.g. codecademy.com) and write software/websites as a freelancer. You can find freelancing gigs easily on the internet. There are many clients who will pay well for fairly simple work.

* Work as a professional Portuguese - English translator. Such work can be found on the internet: translating articles, transcribing audiobooks, etc.

* Find a small problem and solve it. Many problems can be solved with a very simple piece of software, that you can sell. If you need help finding problems: look for situations in which people lose time to repetitive activities. The higher paid those people are, the more valuable the time lost is - the more valuable your solution is.

* Become an expert in *something*. It doesn't matter what that thing is -- if you're really extremely good at or knowledgeable about one particular thing, you can usually find a way to sell your expert services as a consultant, or you'll see some way to make money with it. Granted, some kinds of expertise can bring in more money than others, but on a whole, being an expert in anything is often quite profitable.

* Get an education in a practical field that gives you a somewhat guaranteed income. You mentioned welding in the comments, which is not a bad idea. However...

It is my impression that the employment market in Portugal -- for skilled and unskilled laborers alike -- is very tough. As such, I would encourage you to look beyond the traditional employment market (where you would face lots of competition) for a niche market where you can make money using your current skills (or using skills that you can learn easily). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are you holding all these individual companies with minuscule weights? Can you really stay on top of all these different companies, many of which are in different sectors?

Why, as an engineering student, are you not invested in a single tech firm? Is your domain-specific knowledge really stronger when it comes to Kraft Heinz than when it comes to a company in a sector that you actually know something about? (I am perhaps incorrectly assuming that you don't know the food sector very well.) 

The point I'm trying to make is that when it comes to investing for the long-term, placing your investments in a sector that you know and understand deeply (e.g. thanks to your education or day job) is usually a good idea. Conversely, I've always found it absurd that many people have strong opinions on companies and events in their sector of expertise, and then place their investments in sectors they know next-to-nothing about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, don't worry about getting the most out of it. Actively trying to keep track of everything **and** getting the most out of the book is exhausting. The start of Infinite Jest is known for being quite demanding, so I suggest taking it easy on the first pass. If you really want to get a thorough understanding of the book, read it again. (Hint: this is why your coworkers are reading it again.) It'll be both easier and more enjoyable.

Now, about your first read: the first 150-or-so pages are by far the most difficult in the entire book. Most people give up before page 100 (often because they try to read with great attention to detail when they simply don't yet understand the context -- that can burn you out very quickly). If you make it to page 250, you'll most likely finish the book. The reasons for this are:

* the first 150 pages are stylistically by far the most difficult

* the first 150 pages contain a few pretty uncomfortable scenes

* DFW exposes you to dozens of characters in medias res, many of whom are tangential, and it takes some time for the more important characters to actually stick in your memory

* IJ is told in a non-linear fashion. Different storylines develop in different times. It takes a while to get the hang of it, especially because DFW introduces nearly all storylines within the first few chapters.

* The effect of introducing a massive set of both characters and storylines, many of which at first glance seem completely unrelated, can be disorienting. Don't let it dissuade you -- it'll make sense in due time.

I think it'll be much easier to stick through the first 150 pages if you keep an eye out for these pitfalls. Once the story has really been introduced -- that's roughly somewhere around page 200 -- it'll be smooth sailing from then on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure about the nutrients that honey provides. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey#Nutritional_and_sugar_profile):
 In a 100 gram serving, honey provides 304 calories with no essential nutrients in significant content

Beyond that, I wonder if the most commonly industrially used honey-types are processed in some way that endows them with more or less nutrients.

Whether a smoothie spikes your blood sugar or not depends on the fruits you include in it. A smoothie made entirely of dates, for instance, will definitely spike your blood sugar. ([Source.](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2013/10/11/do-smoothies-make-you-fat)) But I totally concede that my example was hyperbolic; there's no question that smoothies are healthier than coke. That being said, I think the point we're all trying to get at here is that smoothies don't appear to be as healthy as the commercials make them out to be. </TEXT>

For me the big question is not about whether they can meaningfully innovate and deliver new products  -- they definitely can -- but whether the revenues from those new products can make up for the (impending) slowdown in revenues from Office. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hardware acceleration platforms are used to handle incoming financial and have their code (usually high-performance C++) execute as quickly as possible. They need data to come in, make a trading decision, and then send that decision back to the exchange *as quickly as possible*. This is key to their trading operation. If they are hiring engineers for high performance systems, then they *really need them*. If they offer you under $75k, then you're being short-changed. I wouldn't be surprised if a good junior engineer at a reasonably well-funded firm can fetch $150k (including bonus). 

Disclosure: I have no idea what the salary market is actually like. I am extrapolating based on (1) what I know about the rates of operations/system engineers in finance, (2) my guess as to how essential you are to the operations of the company, (3) the going rates of software engineers in Chicago, and (4) the fact that hardware engineers are usually slightly less-well compensated than software engineers. </TEXT>
