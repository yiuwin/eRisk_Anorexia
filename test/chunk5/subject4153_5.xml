	<TEXT> Well, there's not much more advice to be doled out, that really boxes in the amount of response you can get. Upgrading ram from 8gb to 16gb helped me quite a bit, I have a ton of mods as well, but I don't know if that is an option for you either. 8 might be the max for your motherboard. And even so, it won't do the magic the way a graphics card upgrade would. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is gonna be one of those deaths I think I'll remember forever. The news is deeply etched into my brain.  My family was going to eat at Shoney's and we'd just pulled into the parking lot when the news came on the radio. It was the short bullet point news announcements in between programs and they led bluntly with "Chris Farley is dead..." And I was sure they were going to say something like, "..is dead tired of making movies." But no luck,  there wasn't much info right then, just found dead. It was a pretty crummy dinner, even crummier than any other meal at Shoney's, I mean.

That death is tied with learning about Phil Hartman after I came home from school and was watching SNL reruns on Comedy Central. It was a rough year for comedy fans.  </TEXT>

I lost track of the magazine after I moved out and was very excited when I got a subscription for my birthday this year, but the excitement was greatly tempered when I noticed the first couple issues had no maps and further research showed that maps had slowly turned into just pull-outs/posters and then pull-outs/posters slowly turned into nothing. :(

	<TEXT> He doesn't really seem to have "an ear" for great screenplays. And in general, he seems to be a more casual movie fan that's happy to eat popcorn and be distracted for a couple hours rather than be really analytical and discerning of the medium. As in the case of The Shining, he doesn't fully appreciate that movies and books are different and may need different approaches..so he had a fairly bland, largely forgotten, but by the book!, TV adaptation made to appease him.

I wouldn't flatly say this is absolutely a *bad* omen, it's just kinda non-information...of course he's going to be happy with the screenplay cause he's been happy with just about every screenplay. We've really gained no confidence in the project by hearing this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It'd be a great effect to see in game, for sure. The problem seems to be a kinda "simplification" of the landscape materials. The land is a bit too hard to sculpt to creek level of details, like trying to carve fine details into clay while wearing gloves. Maybe not impossible, but there's definitely somewhat of a barrier from terraforming at this small of a resolution. 

Maybe more of the culprit is the water though, which doesn't quite have the viscosity of real world water and feels thicker, more like shampoo. Again, for lack of a better word, the "resolution" just isn't small enough to allow it to flow through thin cracks and  crevasses </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool, hopefully this might all be somewhat helpful. First, [here's a quick crop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B87bLR2Jh090X0p6V2U2SjJPTEE/view?usp=sharing) of the map after I adjusted the layers some to more closely match Google Maps, just to show that you can get that more minimalist look easily, if that's more what you're driving towards. If you've got some familiarity with Photoshop, it's simple to mess around with the layer styles and see what looks good to you.

[Here are the brushes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B87bLR2Jh090eW5sTkQ3X1Z6eTQ/view?usp=sharing) I made. The House brush is pretty basic, just a rectangle that has a spacing setting and a small size and position jitter to add some variety. Just draw alongside your roads to easily lay down rows of homes. The settings are made for the scale of my map, so it might be small for your needs and could necessitate increasing the spacing as you increase the actual brush size to fit your map. The Tree brushes are the same, spacing with some size jitter. The dashed line brush I've used for designating neighborhoods or drawing paths traveled. The road brushes aren't anything special, I only made them to quickly be able to reference their sizes. The way I made roads was by using paths, I'd draw a path with the pen tool and then stroke that path. So if I wanted a two-lane road I could easily pick out that road brush in my palette and stroke the path so it's the proper thickness. Or a different brush to draw a highway..or a walking path, make sense? Saves some time from remembering what your brush size needs to be and always toggling the size up and down as you work on different elements.

And [here are the styles](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B87bLR2Jh090Q253SlNNbGVtbGc/view?usp=sharing) I've been using. Set up separate layers for each aspect-roads, buildings, trees, water and apply these styles and then you just draw on the right layers and you've easily added new elements that have a consistent look that's always easy to universally modify down the road if you should wish. 

Hopefully all that is easy to follow, I don't share my tools and techniques much, so I'm not used to explaining and instructing how to use them and so might accidentally skip some steps in between or not be fully explicit on how I achieved certain things. Let me know how it goes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man, I started a city map a year and a half or so ago and I was in the same boat. Tons of help and programs geared towards fantasy or larger scale geographic maps, but not a whole lot out there on creating a modern map. I believe with QGIS or ArcGIS there was a convoluted way to make fictional maps but it seemed like a hassle. Eventually I just resigned myself to do it without any helping hands in Photoshop. 

I was able to work out a good enough system for my needs though using layer styles and custom brushes and paths. So it still feels dynamic and pretty easy to tweak on a global scale..if I want to change the color of buildings or thicken the stroke on the roads, for some examples. [Here's a little section](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B87bLR2Jh090eTYzNnNhQ1JuTjg/view?usp=sharing) of my map to show the look. As much as I'd love to make it look just like a satellite image, I think this is a nice fun level of detail without making me go insane and wanting to kill myself over the tedium. :D

If Photoshop is an option for you and this approach is appealing I could help you get started and give you some of my custom tools.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gervais was never a producer in any sense more than he made the original and had to be credited in some way and got to cash the checks for it. 

Not that you aren't wrong about the vibe of the show regardless. I just rewatched the series with my girlfriend over the course of just a few weeks and it's really jarring to go from seasons 1-3 to 7-9 so quickly. Subtlety, dreadful awkwardness, sadness, low key, realistic storylines...bye bye. The show suffered from major Flandersization.

I think one of the worst single ideas you can easily point at is stringing as along with Erin and Andy(a pairing which was never Jim and Pam no matter how much they wanted it to be) for two seasons just to have him be dumped for good shortly after.  Thanks for wasting all our investment on a story that was already sub-par from the beginning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, that's what I was thinking, it's quasi bait-and-switch so it's no surprise that more discerning shoppers find it obnoxious. It reminds me of the coupons Staples sends out every couple weeks that have so many qualifiers that they're basically useless. Yeah, thanks, just don't waste the paper if you don't want to actually incenitivize.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm happy to have any Sherlock, but this has always bummed me out a bit too. Something like this is fun when it's..one Treehouse of Horror episode a season or whatever...but when production is constantly like moving mountains, this feels kind of like a waste of the talent's precious time. Like an ultimate troll move, "Want something new in less than three years? Sure, sure...how about this...*snicker*...umm, non-canon, Victorian episode?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose I could see it being interpreted by some that way, but I don't think most would. Anecdotally, but I've never heard or read anyone mention it with the intention to mock it, but being curious about it in the same way it's fun to see audition tapes or hear early casting news on such an iconic film and imagining "what if". And this is just a very unique case where our peek into this alternate universe isn't limited to an unspectacular few minutes reading from a script in an office but having half a film to enjoy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really holding my breath. They hyped it up somewhat for the first blu-ray release and then it ended up being basically nothing. I was gonna say that they might be withholding it to have an incentive to buy yet another release in the future..and Bob Gale confirmed that line of thinking. But I don't know what they're waiting for if not the big high-def release or the 30th anniversary coinciding with the actual movie's timeline. 

I think it would've been smarter just to make a truly definitive feeling collection rather than counting on the most die-hardest of fans, the only ones interested in Eric Stoltz's footage, jumping at a third, if we're lucky...but maybe the fourth or fifth, cash grab release in the future. After being jerked around for years, I don't know if the interest will overcome the apathy and frustration.  </TEXT>

And don't be fooled too much by coincidences in The Gunslinger, he made a revised edition around the time that the last books were being written to fix some inconsistencies and add in some of those foreshadowing elements.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Happy I could help, I remember back in the olden days, looking up Comedy Central's schedule and vigilantly watching out for episodes so I could rewatch my favorite sketches or catch recurring ones I hadn't seen before. Even ordering home-recorded VHS tapes to find them. 

And you'd think that in this day and age it'd be easier to find your favorite clips, but since NBC thinks the best plan is to both withhold episodes and punish everyone who tries to step in and conveniently share clips...I'm glad to have my digital collection and being able to I can occasionally help out others.   </TEXT>

Hopkins' Hannibal has the same problem as Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrence in that he's kinda insane and evil from the beginning and never feels quite human, just "bad guy". Not that this is inherently a bad thing, but personally it's been much more enjoyable to see a more nuanced and slowly developing character.  </TEXT>
