	<TEXT> What child does? Parents control children and raise them... how is an adopted child any different. These people are vloggers and do it for a living. They arent the first to adopt and post about it. Just search adoption story and you find thousands of people want in to share the journey and joy pf the experience for others to relate to in a similar situation. It also inspires others to adopt as well. How is this bad to do. If you are looking for the negatives in everything you'll find it. 

Start trying to see the good in things and maybe you'll be a happier person.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are you talking about? Trolling adoption forums? Lets talk about the US and the foster to adopt program... watch a newborn due to parents unable to care for child, family cares for the baby 6 months, parents show they are now "able" and get the kid back. Welfare checks for kids till a certain age and then put up for adoption and have another baby to collect. Everywhere is corrupt regardless of country. HAGUE has helped with this internationally and just recently (like the last week) put all European adoptions on hold for violating HAGUE. 

At the end of the day, children need help and this bullshit of giving people crap for adopting internationally is garbage. Have you adopted before?  </TEXT>
