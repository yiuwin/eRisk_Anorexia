	<TEXT> There was this absent minded guy that worked with me at TSA.  I always liked him and he was friendly.  He appeared dumb at first, but he would have these moments of clarity that made me think he wasn't dumb at all.

One day I walk in the break room and he's doodling on a piece of paper.  I take a look and recognize some of the math symbols from calculus.

"What are you writing?", I asked.

"Oh, I had thought about this theorem I wanted to flesh out." He scratched his head in thought.

So after this I talked to him more.  He was literally a rocket scientist for NASA.  He was in his 50s and said he just got burned out from it and decided to find a job that would allow him to relax.   </TEXT>

Perrin himself has a hard time letting go of being a "blacksmith", and I think the aspect of communicating with wolves makes it worse for him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's fine to think the shirt is in poor taste, but would you take a selfie with it and try to make a "statement"?

I have two boys with autism and constantly see jokes about someone being so "autistic" because they act goofy.  I don't personally like it, but realize they are trying to use edgy humor to get a laugh.  Most people that make jokes like that wouldn't openly laugh at someone with autism or OCD.  

I personally think she looks like a spoiled entitled brat and needs to get a sense of humor.  You should be able to laugh at yourself and take jokes in stride, especially if they aren't mean spirited. </TEXT>

It hasn't worked on education, poverty, terrorism, or climate change.  Why?  Because people are speculating on how to solve a problem when they aren't sure what caused the problem in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made a similar analogy.  Imagine if President Obama or Clinton had decided to take in a country concert.  At the end of the concert the singer gives a speech touting how they are nervous about their policies are hurting/going to hurt Americans like them.

You think the press would support that?  Of course not, they would be called racist/sexist and disrespectful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was a surrogate, and he was talking about precedent for a registry.  He mentioned Iran as another time we had used a registry as well as Japan during World War 2.

It was Megyn Kelley that said,"Internment camps?  Seriously, that's what scares people?"

Paraphrasing, but the surrogate didn't talk about internment camps.  Had he just mentioned Iran, and if Megyn hadn't said internment camps Takei wouldn't have said a thing.  

It was dumb of the guy to mention it. </TEXT>
