	<TEXT> I'd be curious to see more of this. Do you think there's any possibility what is written is fiction? After a couple of seconds of research I found mention that he wrote some fictional accounts. However I don't know if that's actually true. </TEXT>

Video tutorials were the only thing that made sense to me learning how to play. </TEXT>
