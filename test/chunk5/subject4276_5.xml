	<TEXT> Wow way to shut down the argument dip shit. its not hard to debunk either. Antarctica is restricted, but that would be impossible if it was the edge of the earth. Do you know how much man power would be needed to not only man such a project, but to supply, maintain, keep mouths shut, to build all the equipment needed for enforcement. It simply isn't possible, and you're simply full of shit. So what if I insult you retards, you seem to have no problem throwing right back. the only difference is that a 3 year old couldn't do better than me in a geography test. You people are so fucking dumb. I mean seriously do you just hear this shit and never think, "well how is that possible, how do they pay for that, or how do they keep the millions of people in this project hush." I mean Area 51 has people who leak shit but I've never heard of any one talking about being stationed on the USS fuck you, during its earth edge patrols. Fuck off with that shit </TEXT>

	<TEXT> so dose it feel like your going 50mph inside a car as apposed to outside? Look all it took was a fucking google search, educate yourself moron.

We do not feel any of this motion because these speeds are constant. The spinning and orbital speeds of Earth stay the same so we do not feel any acceleration or deceleration. ... For example, if you are in a car which is moving at a constant speed on a smooth surface, you will not feel much motion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me tell you how government works since I have been in government and you haven't. Every piece of equipment is made by the lowest bidder. So yeah im not surprised the camera sucks and probably cost more than its worth. and yes believing in bronze age fairy tales is pretty stupid. almost as stupid as a flat earther </TEXT>

	<TEXT> oh, small in numbers so I shouldn't worry about you? No, you don't just get to live in you ignorance just because your small in numbers. Also wow I based my opinion on observations by people who have seen the earth from space, photos from space, and the agency that's job is to go to fucking space! Who would of fucking guessed that's where I would look to for information regarding fucking space! But when someone points out these observations and evidence it's convently fake. Yet, no evidence is provided to support otherwise. You people are all crazy, and if your not prove me wrong. One pic, is all it takes. until then fuck off </TEXT>
