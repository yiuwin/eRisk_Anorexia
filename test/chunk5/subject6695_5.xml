	<TEXT> If you truly are about to read it, I envy you. 

This is one the highest praises that anything--novel, game, comic, movie, song, etc.--can get in my humble opinion. I'll pace reading *Book of the New Sun* as to not rush through it before/during exams. Thanks again!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, similar to The Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson. Are the Culture books not released chronologically, or does it just make more sense if you read #2/#3 and then #1?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Until now, *Player of Games* and *Use of Weapons* are on the list of to-reads from the Culture "series". Thank you! 

I might give Ender's Game another shot (last time I read it was when I was 14ish so might not have appreciated it as much as it deserves) then continue on with Speaker.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Woah, that sounds really really cool. A friend and I were discussing the logistics about writing a novel almost exactly like this without realizing one already existed. Thank you!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, *Player of Games* and *Use of Weapons* are the two first novels in the Culture series I'll check out. Thanks for helping narrow that down further haha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is the series nearly finished? Another book is supposedly coming out next year and some of my favourite series (novel or not) have been on releasing extremely slowly. Having another isn't preferable, but I'll keep it in mind for sometime down the line. Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And significantly more books to add to my list. *A Fire Upon the Deep* is back home at my parents' place across the country so I'll pick it up the next time I'm there. 

*The Stars My Destination* was one of the books I was debating to read when starting *A Canticle for Leibowitz*, thanks for the inadvertent reminder!  </TEXT>
