Can someone explain to me why these people are pushing so hard to keep their phones? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to raid pretty heavily on WoW for Burning Crusade. I had no issue wiping over and over. I was playing a video game and it was fun.

My issue was always the people who couldn't stop bitching and complaining about the whole thing. If you're not having fun just don't play anymore. The line between reality and Wow is super blurry sometimes.

Also the people talking about, "the good old raids" like Naxx...man that's so annoying.  </TEXT>

I just wish people would stop falling for it so easily. Like I said, it's not always wrong but the majority of the time its bullshit. I wouldn't mind a president who tried to unite us in pursuit of the space race or something.

	<TEXT> Hitler was hesitant in authorizing Rhm's execution, and gave him the option of suicide. On 1 July, SS-Brigadefhrer Theodor Eicke (then Kommandant of the Dachau concentration camp) and SS-Obersturmbannfhrer Michael Lippert walked into his cell, laid a pistol on the table, told Rhm he had ten minutes to use it and left. He refused, stating, "If I am to be killed, let Adolf do it himself." Having heard nothing after the stipulated ten minutes, Eicke and Lippert returned to Rhm's cell to find him standing with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance, and Lippert shot him in the chest at point-blank range. The bullet hit Rhm in the heart, killing him almost instantly.

That dude died like a fucking boss. It's a shame he was a Nazi.  </TEXT>

The Irish immigrants, the Japanese, the Chinese who were buying up California real-estate in the 80s and were gonna take over the country, then the Russians, and now it's Middle Easterners and Muslims and Mexican immigrants.

	<TEXT>  I find it amusing that these people keep trying to legitimize their bullshit with important wording as if they're G-men on Hoover approved missions. Leaked emails on a questionable site are now "files". Loons who sit in their basement breaking codes that don't exist who toodle on down to a public resturant and fire off a gun are "investigators".

I'm almost done with my MA in Criminal Justice, and this kind of shit is exactly why vigilantes are frowned upon. It's because they're usually total fools without any level of training.

I had a friend, read *had*, that used to do the same shit. He would read a law and assume he knew exactly how it applied in controversial criminal cases. There's a reason people go to law school for 3 years and there is a reason investigators receive years of training- you're not a special snowflake. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Russians hacked the DNC email servers and released all of the emails on Wikileaks, who then of course released them because they're irresponsible tool bags. 

Basically those emails were read and people drew bullshit lines between the emails and created this conspiracy. They basically assume all of the emails are in code because a couple of them sounded off. Which is stupid. I'm kind of frustrated the DNC hasn't just come out and explained some of them.  </TEXT>

I genuinely think the majority of them are just socially inept morons. All it takes a small level of common sense and education to unravel 99% of the things they deem to be reality. 

They're fools who would buy Trump's dried up cum for $1,000,000 an ounce and claim it's the fucking fountain of youth. The worst part is, they're destroying and making a mockery of political discourse with their rampant idiocy, bigotry, and racism. I wholeheartedly support that sub being banned.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bruce and Alfred even talk about Superman bringing a war to them. War basically means a state/period of (armed) conflict between different nations or parties. Also, considering the mass amount of destruction and the grand scale of the film in general, I'd say BVS fits the description of war or at the very least has some war elements in the film.

So basically, if the new Spider-man comes out (fucking hype btw), and they use the words: war, comedy, drama, thriller, and romance a few times, then that movie is suddenly all of those genres?

I never knew I wanted a political thriller war romance comedy drama Spider-man film until today.  </TEXT>

I also agree that storming off was not helpful at all. It really just adds to the overall situation and lack of respect they have for him. I imagine he should have just said, "I'll take out your trash, but please don't call me a bitch." Even if he doesn't win, it makes the situation pass by. A few of those moments and a few years later and he can get out of there.

Depending on OPs age and situation, he probably had no choice. When you're young and being supported by your family you don't generally get to make the call unless you want some real trouble. 

It's super easy for this person to critique OP and say he'd do some shit irl when he is behind his keyboard, but be 16 and beholden to your family and see how it goes. </TEXT>

Holy fucking shit. I can't even. My god damn sides. How does that goofy [picture](http://imgur.com/Q6V4ktO?r) somehow mean the place is a front for a giant pedo conspiracy ring and Shillary is the core of it all? 

I'm not endorsing the pizzagate theory, but I can't imagine what a pizza-related map would be other than code for something.

I once went to a zoo that had a map the shape of a giraffe or a long necked horse or some shit. Do you guys think that maybe I was in the middle of a conspiracy to sell animals for sexual pleasure?

Everything is bizarre when you have no context and have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.

^ Fucking this. These people are taking dots, enlarging/expanding them, then connecting them with some super tenuous and shit tier theories. It's a shame this has created real-world repercussions, cause it was fucking hilarious for a while there.  </TEXT>

I don't think that's how that works. 

He is qualified. As Head Surgeon, he is very familiar with the problems the people he wants to help have. He knows discrimination first hand.

Again, he is probably an incredible surgeon. That doesn't mean he understands Housing and Urban Development. This isn't the sort of job where the person entering it should be at the same level of experience and knowledge as an intern.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I honestly wonder: if I could go back and ask Ayn Rand as she was dying of cancer and on Medicare, what would she say about the inconsistency? Would she own up to it (she broke the rule), or would she add caveats and excuses for how the rule is still true and she somehow didn't do something bad?

This is a super interesting point. My fiance sent me an article that's a few years old which was positing that Ayn Rand is one of the main focal points for this kind of thought and is basically, directly or indirectly, guilty of creating these type of people.

It's cool seeing someone else bring it up. Also if she follows her own philosophy, she'd just make more and more excuses. </TEXT>

I know it's not ideal, but if we are not willing to spend cuz we are saving for a house payment, we may be out of options. I'm open to ideas.

This lacks so much self awareness imo. Maybe you and your wife go visit them for a few days? Or just fucking wait. It's not like this visit is a necessity and the visiting family is being kicked out of their home.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For posterity:

Dear reddit,

I am writing this in my last ditch effort to save this marriage. Although its probably over already... the argument ended with me saying I want a divorce. I do intend to show this post to him. If I am the one in the wrong here, please tell me. I'm not sure what I am even looking for writing this - hearing a voice of reason?

The argument that lead to this edge: his family is flying in from out of country to visit us for a month.

Before anything else, I need to say this: I love his parents and siblings. They are wonderful people. That is not the issue.

The issue: There will be 6/7 people total in our one bedroom apartment for an entire month. I am a very light sleeper and some of his relatives snore. I know I won't sleep well the entire month. I am also a very introverted person. Being around people for a long time wears me out. On top of this, for the past couple of years , Ive led a very high stress life due to work. Constant 80+ hr weeks.. I have not had a real vacation in a long time. I honestly feel like I cannot take anymore stress than whats already on my plate. I just can't.

We've already been hosting one of his siblings for a year and a half to help him get on his feet. Its not an issue but I am exhausted of playing host. If I wasnt so stressed out from work it wouldnt be as much of an issue...

In all itself - if my husband had tried to find a middle ground here this wouldnt be as much of an issue for me. But he didn't. He just looked sheepishly at me and went on with what they asked.

We were planning to move to a bigger place in a couple of months. He never tried to push his family to come a couple months later when we would have more space. He just left me to be the bad guy in front of gis family. Que this argument.

Its not the first time we've run into similar issues and we have almost broken up over this kind of thing several times when dating.

He says I am making him choose between his family and me. I just wanted him to find a better solution at the middle ground.

Am I in the wrong here?

tl;dr: Me 28F with my husband 26M of 6 yrs on brink of divorce due to fam visit. </TEXT>
