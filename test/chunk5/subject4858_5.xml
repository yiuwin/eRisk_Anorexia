	<TITLE> Plastic humidifier tank...fixable? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Reddit I know you're my last hope...I have 2 humidifiers for my business, very important. Last night, one of them broke. The plastic tank has a seal-type thing around the entire top, almost like a lid, but it's not supposed to come off. And it did, broke off. I'll post link below, but it's been discontinued and I have lots of stuff for these so I'd like to salvage the tank if possible. Can plastic be fixed? Here's the item, if you look at the second pic you can kind of see a seal around the tank with little legs coming off. Any ideas? Thanks! Thinking of posting this in skincare or something just to see if anyone has a tank I can buy...

	<TEXT> A friend of mine is OBSESSSSSED. I want to make her some tees or a tote or whatever, any ideas on something that would be funny/clever/etc? Any specific fonts? I'm trying to make it text-based rather than image-based but whatever works would be cool. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hoping to get a system built... </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had a friend who built a system, using NES controllers (generic ones, not authentic NES) that had every NES, SNES, Sega, Atari, and I feel like other games on it. He built it on a hard drive and we basically based our lives around it. I sold my old systems and I'm hoping someone can either build me one (I'll pay) or teach an oaf like me to build one, if possible. Thanks for help
