	<TEXT> No, you would not as you are not directly threatened by violence in Chicago. It needs to be a threat due to something personal to you that you would have no hope of escaping from in your home country.

Based on what I have been told, most refugees should be vaccinated. They are in the refugee centre close to me.

I guess some areas would enjoy greater success. There are very few hate crime laws in Europe. It is only a hate crime if you threaten violence against somebody, not just for speaking out against something (unless what you are saying is woefully inaccurate and designed to cause hatred towards a specific group).

Sweden is the example that most people use when they say refugees are not working. This is because many are still studying Swedish (8-16 month course when you arrive). You should have little difficulty getting a job once you know Swedish and if you are prepared to accept whatever.

The EU would have to put it to an EU Parliament vote, so yes, we would have a say in it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The IRA is not a joke. IRA affiliated groups have left bombs in Northern Ireland on a weekly basis and MI6 believe them to be a bigger threat than ISIS as we know that the IRA have recently sourced a LOT of explosive material but absolutely no idea what they are going to be using them for. Wikipedia is a shit source when it comes to terrorist attacks as minor things get ignored. It probably does not even mention the attempt on police officer's lives outside of a school just a few weeks ago.

And, it likely cost a lot more than $200 to get in there. Just saying.

Trump, once again, is a terrorist donator. He is fucking scum. As is King, who works closely with Trump.

I did not say IRA are worse than Islam. I am saying Trump is a terrorist supporter. </TEXT>

Thousands of people were killed by the IRA and affiliated groups. The IRA still place bombs in Ireland to this day. I am not sure you even know what you are talking about. You just really hate Islam and are closing your mind to everything else, right?

That was Iran's money. It was seized from Iran a while back, then it was given back to them. it belonged to Iran. It was frozen in US Banks when Iran had sanctions against it.

Donald Trump is a terrorist supporter. FACT. HE ATTENDED A GROUP RUN BY TERRORISTS. FOR FUCK SAKE. HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT THIS IS WRONG TO DO?

	<TEXT> Well, since I have encountered several people who have reported crime for no reason, it kinda does happen. More people viewing a crime would increase the number even though there has been no actual increase in crime. You also need to be aware that people are becoming more confident in reporting crime to the police. In the past they would not have done, but now they are reporting it. This also contributes to the increase. 

Please learn how Sweden records crime, because you don't seem to grasp that. I know how Sweden records crime. You do not.

This is why the media (namely Fox), focuses so heavily on Sweden. Sure, Sweden has problems. But like, for the most part, taking in refugees has worked amazingly well. The media wants to chip away at that and try to convince everybody that it does not. It is silly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Donald Trump would have been aware of it. It was very much heavily in the news at the time. You knew who the leaders of Sinn Fein were. They had been plucked directly from the IRA and they all spoke about this.

It is no secret that Sinn Fein was closely linked to the IRA, and you just denying it does show that you do not know what was going on in NI at the time.

It is not a conspiracy at all. The leaders of Sinn Fein were in the IRA. This is an actual provable fact.

And I see you are ignoring King (one of Trump's cronies) who did KNOWINGLY fund the IRA directly.

Your President funded terrorism. Deal with it.

This was a shit excuse for a show. I was forced to watch the whole lot in order to review it, but omfg. I had never seen Bill Nye before this show, and I hope I never see him again.

He never let people with opposing views speak to him at all. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is The Simpsons turning into Family Guy? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-07 17:04:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have only really watched the older episodes of The Simpsons. Since newer episodes have started to air on the channel I always keep on in the background, I am starting on those.

However, one thing that has struck me is that The Simpsons is starting to become more like Family Guy (yes, I know the latter was based on the former). I can't quite put my finger on it, but the style of jokes that they do is probably it. Violence seems to be a bit more extreme too now. There are a LOT of sexual jokes being made.

Am I going crazy, or is the show leaning more towards The Family Guy crowd now? </TEXT>

You are the first Manchester United fan I have ever seen disrespectful towards Brighton. All of your forums seem to be saying Brighton will stay up. Most have fond memories of the FA Cup Final.

I guess you were not around then, or?

You are a Trump supporter and don't even live in Manchester. You live in the South-East. FML.  </TEXT>
