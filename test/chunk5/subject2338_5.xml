	<TEXT> Alrighty,so long story short,I HAVE to take 12 credits this summer in order to get my full ride scholarship next fall. My scholarship pays for literally everything,from gas to food to tuition,so I definitely am going to take the 4 classes this summer needed for my 12 credits worth.
The semester is split into two sessions,and I'm taking 2 classes per session. Three of the four classes are online,and they are all relatively "fluffy" gen. ed classes. Like literally,I'm taking a mythology class,a philosophy class,an astronomy class,and a class about technology and society. All intro classes. Am I fucked,or could this summer be okay?
Either way,I'll be done with finals by the first of August,so it hopefully won't be too bad.
Anybody have any tips or experience with summer classes or online classes? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ehh.
A lot of the guys I dated last semester were frat guys. They were always cool to me,sometimes obnoxious,but not shitty people </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was in high school,I received ZERO sex education. ZERO. And i only graduated high school in 2013.
My parents are Mormon,so we just never talked about sex. I learned nothing of birth control,except that condoms are important,but my friends claimed that "pulling out" was equally effective.
It wasn't until I was in rehab,that my doctor was extremely forceful about me being put on birth control. I got an IUD,and until the day that it was put in,I didn't even know what they were. 
If the adults in the U.S weren't so damn terrified of young people having sex,and talking about it,then maybe kids would know how to safely have sex and avoid pregnancy. It isn't this innate knowledge that you're born with

	<TEXT> I just don't acknowledge them. Or if I do,I'm a mega bitch to the guys.
I used to work at a fancy restaurant downtown,and my car was parked blocks away,and I often didn't get off of work until 11:00pm.
Drunk guys would yell at me,hit on me and once,a guy even grabbed at my arm.
I always just continued my stride,and pretended they didn't exist.
Once a guy was like "baby girl,you're so fine,I could show you a good time tonight", and my mega-bitchy response was "are you fucking kidding me?Do you think a girl with a body and face like mine wants anything to do with a loser like you?" 
He didn't have much to say after that.
Street harassment isn't worth the energy that some women devote to it. It's annoying,rude,sexist and unacceptable,but I'm not going to get bent outta shape over some obnoxious comments from lame guys whose opinions do NOT matter at all. </TEXT>
