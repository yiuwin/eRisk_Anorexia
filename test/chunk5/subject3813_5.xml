	<TEXT> Are you asking how to tell if someone else is blacked out or if you're blacked out?

Cause if it signs that you are blacked out, and I think that's what your asking, it might be too late to tell. For me, at least, it's fine, fine, what the hell, how did it get to be 7am. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rice is dirt cheap, and if you get brown rice it'll be better than processed carbs, nutritionally speaking. also it's extremely versatile. I make a stir fry with brown rice, tofu, beans, eggs and random veggies about once a week, pop in in the fridge, and have leftovers for a week. 

this is a good starting recipe but there is a ton of room for improv and substitution. also this recipe leaves out soy sauce but it's a wonderful addition.

	<TITLE> Just rented a house that was built in 1975 and hasn't changed since. Not furnished. What to do? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Think everything carpeted(not shag, thank goodness) and dark wood paneling literally EVERYWHERE(including the bathroom). I apologize that I don't have any pictures. The whole house is very dark, with very little built in light. However, it does have alot of space, including a huge finished basement and a large living room.we are allowed to paint. What can I do to make the place feel less dated and more airy? We plan on doing alot of entertaining. Thanks! </TEXT>
