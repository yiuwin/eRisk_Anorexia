	<TEXT> He could have said aspiring rapper for any number of reasons.  If you want to stereotype, other alternatives include:

All murderers are aspiring rappers.

All prisoners are aspiring rappers.

All Missourians are aspiring rappers.

It's only a racist comment because, from all choices, you chose "all black people are are aspiring rappers" - and that's an indication of your prejudice, not op's.

The fallacy is that you inferred a meaning not explicitly stated using your own stereotyping.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The comment he was responding to didn't say aspiring rapper "because his skin is black"

The "because" part is something you decided.  And the decision you made is that all rappers are black.  

Meaning op comment is *not necessarily* racist, but respondents comment *is* racist </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yeah - no doubt He was definitely invoking racism.  

I (and you) only know that because the first thing we think when someone says rapper is "black people" - ironically meaning we can only scorn OP because we were racist enough to even know what he is talking about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Youre right, it's probably not *actively dangerous*.  But let's say 1 in 1000 chance he isn't fleeing but going to grab his gun from his car.  Fog of war. That's grounds to shoot and sleep soundly.

I think it's reasonable to shoot if the stick in question is, say a lead pipe and the teen was going for another strike on the victim.  A blow to the victim in that case could result in death or TBI/permanent impairment.  *IF* it went down like that, the shooting could have saved the victims life </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Coins would probably considered too dull, heavy, and weird tasting

Anything reflective and colorful is going to be good.  I think Mardi gras beads are ideal. They have that reflective, shiny, colorful quality that twinkles in the light.  

You can try a few things and see what they take. 

 Make sure to just give  2 or 3 at a time... These are prized human treasures to be coveted.  They can't just be gotten anywhere.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got it going with some chickadees in my back yard.  It took me months.  Crows are smarter, but expect it to take time.  They also like shiny objects, buttons, beads, etc which you could also place when you leave as a small offering of friendship </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a parrot owner and general bird enthusiast.  To really up the ante, you should start making unique "call", a simple whistle or melody,  when approaching and smashing nuts.  

After a while, they may come when you call and even repeat it back to you when they see you </TEXT>
