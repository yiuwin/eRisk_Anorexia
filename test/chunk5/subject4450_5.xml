	<TEXT> gaffigan's material isn't about white people tho. a lot of black comics, especially the ones who are great social critics (specifically of black culture) like rock, are making points that could elicit the wrong type of laughs from people who can't relate, not just white people. it's the same reason chappelle quit his comedy central show, he felt like white people were laughing for the wrong reasons

plus it's just for his special. gaffigan could fill the audience when he tapes his specials with children or his friends and no one would care </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'm pretty sure he asked for all black audiences for all his hbo specials too. he talked about it years ago. it's a combination of black people being better laughers ("they laugh with their feet") and the material being critical/about black culture so he feels weird having a mostly white audience, like chappelle's new ones

i think for the taping it's completely understandable </TEXT>
