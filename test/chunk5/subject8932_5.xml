	<TITLE> Basics for C# </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-26 22:18:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all, I really really want to learn the basics for C#. I do not have a clue what im looking at, or what C# even is. Can anybody recommend a course or even a few youtube videos showing the fundamentals to computer programming.

I've got to know the pure basics or C# in order to apply for a job in the IT department at my work place.

All I know is that C# is a sort of language that programers use to make apps, websites, software etc... and that's is all. that is all mu knowledge on the subject.

When I see things like

[Help: Script, Welcome, Task.Java... {PublicCass FileLogger}:

All that stuff, how does somebody start this?... Programming is a massive subject and I've been told by the head of IT, that if I learn C# pure basics he can let me do some work with him. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Extracting Dr Emmerich </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-26 13:16:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Is by far my favourite mission. I had such a tough time doing it. 

I'm not sure if the next part is spoilers, but if you don't know anything at all about it, please do not read on.

Okay, so the mission as a whole is broken up into 2 main parts (the part where we see Skull face push Dr Emmerich and we first see the Metal Gear in the construction warehouse) and the 2nd part where we have to make contact with Dr Emmerich and extract him.

The first part was quite easy, even though I got spotted a good few times/called in air support/raised the alert status... But the 2nd part I did so so well, not one spot, never once raised the alert status.

When I finally finished the mission, I got Rank E??!?!.. Is it because the first part of the entire mission was done so badly?

I'm tempted to redo it because it was so intense. I LOVE this game. Greatest ever. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ELI5: Why don't Israel just relocate? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> 
One day in the future there will be a major war involving Israel. They've got so many countries against them in that entire region, why don't they just move?
I don't mean move out of Israel. Start up a new state... far far away from where they are currently located.

New Mexico in the USA is one of the most sparsely populated regions. Could the Israeli's move from Israel to their new state "New Israel" in New Mexico? Sounds stupid... but what if they decided to do so. Would it be seen as a major defeat?
Is the whole reason they are where they are, due to the religious reasons? (Jerusalem) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all,
I went to COD.com/Beta and I entered my code, sleceted PS network and then chose Europe and clicked REDEEM.
It then took me back to the countdown screen. I tried it again, and it now says "The code is invalid" Does this mean that the first time I did it, it worked?
Also - when people say midnight, is that Midnight California, or midnight London??? What midnight/ </TEXT>
