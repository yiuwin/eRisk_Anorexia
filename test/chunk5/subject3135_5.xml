	<TEXT> Don't know if you've seen any of their newer shows, but Jane the Virgin and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend are fantastic. I have never related to fictional characters more in my life.

But I'll give you Supernatural. As much as I love that show, I wish they would end it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Jane wiki page has Jane listed as 24 years old in Season 2.

And apparently, Rafael is 32, making him 8 years older than Jane.

Huh. The things you learn. </TEXT>

While I like this actor, he looks really young compared to Gina in the picture. Maybe I'm just used to him playing a teenager. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm visiting my family for the holiday and I just got my mom and sister hooked on the show! Only took one episode and they're in love. It's a bit too modern for my dad. *cough homophobic cough.*


I typically watch the show by myself but I really like watching it with other people! I guess that's why I love the episode discussions so much even though I can't watch the show live anymore.


I'm curious! Who do you guys watch the show with?  </TEXT>
