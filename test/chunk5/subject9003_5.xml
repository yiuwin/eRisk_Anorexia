	<TEXT> Not exactly true. Science owes its existence to philosophy and there is a field in philosophy called philosophy of science, but philosophical inquiry is very different than scientific inquiry. Philosophers and scientists are both truth seekers. Philosophers are concerned with metaphysical, epistemological, logical, and ethical truths. Scientists are concerned with empirical truths.

Scientists are called natural philosophers because they are exactly that. In philosophy a naturalist believe that only laws of nature and forces operate in the world; the idea or belief that nothing exists beyond the natural world. Scientists are philosopher because they accept some metaphysical argument for naturalism. All of science is a product of philosophy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Effects are bound to a strain. Two harvests may yield different potencies. Whenever I go to the dispensary I ask for what they think looks best this week. Sometimes the Durban is really good and sometimes it isn't. Some strains are more consistent than others. If you want the best bud, ask the budtender, look at the buds, and give them a squeeze and smell.

Also, don't condone bad actions or shame them. Be objective in explaining the conditions that determine the quality, whether good or bad, of an act. 


Sorry I'm just a person living hippy. I've met a lot of a 'bad' people and very few were genuinely bad. Heroin dealers, Italian/Irish/Jewish/Japanese mob, stock brokers on wall street. They were all just a little lost in this world. Victims of greed or scared for their families. It's not the act but the reason that gets you into a 'bad' person's head

	<TEXT> Everyone is different. Shrooms made me drop the ego and see things for what they actually were. Shrooms pushed me out of the pit of depression more than therapy, Prozac, or two months in the hospital ever did (though I still think therapy is still very useful).

Shrooms make me very uncomfortable, but this is because I had been sitting with some very uncomfortable stuff. I tell everyone I ever trip with to walk into the trip with some tough questions they need to reflect on, otherwise you can get lost in your natural tendencies, such as suicide or anxiety. That's my one tip for any potential first time trippers, have questions you can reflect on if things go south.

	<TEXT> It really isn't a cool story, but I'll go ahead. I must say first that I was being very irresponsible, immature, stupid, and how ever else you wanna slice it.

It was 420 and there was a little festival going on outside of town. It was the weekend before finals and I had been going kinda crazy. Two weeks of constant drinking.
I started the day with a bottle of everclear and about 6 54mg concertas (324) of some sort of concerta. I roll up with these two girls whom I will be sharing the tent with that night. On the drive over I had already gotten a two shots deep (mind you it is before noon). We set up our two person tent, take a shot, smoke a joint, and go to check out who's playing. We see our friends are playing and watch their set. The next set comes on and we aren't so entertained.

Head back to camp, take some shots, and smoke some hash. We wander around all the other campsites and talk with friends for a while. Well, one of my good friends, R, catches my eye. He's telling me our other good friends are playing the last set. We didn't want to miss that show for anything, but I was feeling tired. I told him about the concerta and somehow we agreed to take all of it throughout the night. We go back to the camp site, break apart the pill, take off the time release, do our routine (eat the pill and stick the outer wax under the tongue), and finish the bottle of everclear. Things start to get blurry here. It had only been eight hour since I opened the bottle and now it's gone. I vaguely remember taking the other two concertas, but we were all browned out.

My memory starts to come back to me when our friends go on. I danced with the girls and they wanted to go back to the bed for some fun. We walk back all giggly and notice our neighboring campsite had a bonfire. We walked over to say hi. We noticed they had a winebag and they invited us to slap the bag. This is where things get real blurry. This is where I got the shrooms (I vaguely remember one of the guys showing off his stash). As we keep slapping the bag my memory fades. 

The next morning I wake in the dirt with my face in my burn jacket and shirt. Someone says "Stop moving we don't want to get any dirt in there!". I laugh and say "What the fuck did I do this time?!". I remember looking out towards the mountains, blinking, and seeing everything burst with that shroomy color.
The girls came running up to me with R in a panic. I ask them what happened and they couldn't say a word. R then studders with "I-I-I think you should p-pack up camp. He needs to get to the hospital now!". After a minute or two the strangers that were cleaning me up and bandaging us to go straight to the ER. R came along for the ride
We were about 40 mins from the hospital and the girls were freaking out. The pain didn't hit me yet. Maybe it was the alcohol or shock, but I just stared out the window. I was confused beyond comprehension. Everything was moving in the strangest way and things took on the most unexplainable purple color. I was so happy and so confused. I knew I had slept in a fire for a couple of hours and that I had some burns on my back, I knew I was on mushrooms, I knew I was still speedng, I knew I was drunk, but I couldn't comprehend the reality of it. Being there in that point of time, made me feel so alive and happy. The fact that one could endure such a thing and be alive was so cool to me. This feeling persisted for weeks. It was the best shroom afterglow ever. 
I went to take my finals the following two days and brought my GPA up from a 3.3 to a 3.9. Right after my last final I hopped in the car and went into surgery. 
After surgery I couldn't really walk for two weeks because the donor site for my skin graft was on my leg.

From this experience I took away two things:
1, Giant pain tolerance, appreciation for pain, and possible masochist problem
2, distaste for alcohol and love for psychedelics.

This was a freewrite. I don't feel like rereading/editing it. Please just ignore the mistakes

I don't remember eating shrooms, nor burning in a fire, but my friend said I traded hash for shrooms. I was right in the middle of my trip and my pupils were huge. The doctor asked me if I was on something. I told him I was coming down from shrooms and feeling pretty drunk, but I could handle it. He didn't care, because
a) I was in an immense amount of pain. The pain was at the point where I was puking. He offered me oxycodone but I opted for some anti-nausea meds.
b) My collar bone was becoming exposed and we needed to prevent infection.

Any other doctor could have easily put me on valium or whatever, but there were more important things to tend to </TEXT>

Walked into the box office and it reaked of pot
Walked into the venue and it was so smoky that you couldn't make out who was on stage from a distance.
A bunch of white teenagers standing around chain smoking blunts and a handful of black people rocking out to the music
Walked out of the venue smelling like blunt roach.
I smelled my dirty laundry a few days later and it still wreaked.

	<TEXT> Some kid in my logic class does this. I sit right next to him everyday and I see him rip his Atmos Raw and blow it down his shirt. Our professor doesn't really give a shit. It's Colorado. I was walking on a trail with a friend right off campus and we were smoking a joint I got for free from the dispensary. Our Phil professor was walking towards us. She stopped and talked to us for a little while, passing the joint back and forth.

I just went on a tangent, but remember that you don't need to be discrete in Colorado. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, soy is a very good product that we have been eating for a few thousand years. It may not be healthy in its modern supermarket tofu form. 

You sound defensive, as if you don't want to give up meat. 

If you like to eat meat and don't want to be bothered, eat meat and tell the preachy vegans you don't care. 

If you like meat and want a rational for eating meat, good luck. Why people struggle with the idea that vegetarianism and vegan ism are more sustainable, healthful, and ethical options is beyond me. If you want the vegans to shut up, then stop provoking them.

	<TEXT> At my school it is ubsurd. We live in Colorado where cannabis is legal for medical patients and those over the age of 21. If one gets caught on campus with any amount of cannabis, they are required to take a mental health screening. That screening is a 30 minute session with a social worker and you are charged $140 for that session. Normally you get three free sessions 30 minute sessions with a social worker. I think that is taking advantage of the situation, but that's just me. You can also lose all of your scholarships if you get caught multiple times (not sure exactly how many). 

It definitely is a money grab across the board </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did something similar before.

I woke up hungover, took some Concerta, and embarked on a three hour drive to the desert. We took a wrong turn and made it to our trail head at 1. Ate mushrooms, set up camp, and then went crazy down in this canyon that was filled with Anazazi ruins. Sun was starting to go down around 6:30 and I dropped acid for the first time in my life. Tripped through the night, tending a fire that was our only source of warmth (besides sleeping bags and tents that we never used). Watched the sunrise, packed up camp, and drove home. Stayed up for 36 hours. We were smoking hash and drinking beer throughout the whole ordeal. I felt fine the entire trip, but I was pretty drained when I got home. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I begged my pediatrician, GP, therapist, and psychologist to stop pushing me Prozac. I ended up giving up when I went inpatient for an eating disorder and started Prozac. Fast forward a few weeks, out of in patient, the Prozac started to kick in, relapsed, reached my lowest weight and heart rate, almost died. Decided to graduate high school early move in with my dad on the other side of the country (after extended in patient care that was closer to my Dad).

Removing myself from my mom, the person who would wake me up in the night to tell me how much of a failure I am, the person who used me as a punching bag for 17 years, the person who acted purely in spite of her insecurities, who tried to control everything I did (you can't go skiing on your day off of work/school because you didn't eat dinner last night), was the best decision of my life. I still had my issues, but I wasn't getting worse. 

The Prozac was supposed to be working when I was dying. I was a little bit happier, but that was because I wasn't eating. At that point in my life, not eating made me happy. Moving away from my problems and finding a good therapist who helped me unravel my issues instead of pushing a shitty drug was more effective. I don't think that Prozac is intrinsically bad, but it distracts is from the important stuff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You really need to work with tofu to get it the way you want it. For extra firm crispy tofu I strart by dry frying tofu in a non stick pan (like a wok or teflon pan). I then wrap it in tinfoil and freeze it. When frozen take it out to thaw and marinate in whatever you want (I like cumin, basil, soy sauce, peanut oil, and garlic). Lightly bread in something (corn starch is good). Fry in hot pan with whatever oil you want (Butter is my favorite).
