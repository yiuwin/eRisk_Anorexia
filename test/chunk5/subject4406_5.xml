	<TEXT> It's usually a whole family affair with siblings, their partners coming over. My partners mums house is the biggest and most comfortable. And in the insane Australian heat, hers is the only one with air con. Next week I'm going to try suggesting that we bring food. Hopefully this doesn't offend as badly. Thank you for your suggestions. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do you either refuse food politely, or try to explain beforehand that you're on a diet? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've been starting to eat better and I've been going to the gym 3 times a week, one of those with a personal trainer. It's fantastic! I've been feeling better, I've lost weight. I prepare my own healthy breakfasts and lunches and my partner and I make our dinners together.

The problem is, on the weekend, we visit her mum one day, and my mum another. Both mums always try to overload us with food. Even after saying we are on a diet, there will be cakes, cookies, soft drink, all waiting for us to consume. Then even when I request a roast and salad for what I'd like for dinner, my mum has made something dripping in gravy, all potatoes, cakes that are covered in sugar syrup, etc.

How do I tell them I can't eat this? I don't want to offend them, but it's a recurring thing. I tell them I'm on a diet but they get upset that I no longer want to eat their home cooked meals. Any advice? I don't want to sound ungrateful.

TL;DR mum has tries to feed us carb heavy, sugar heavy meals when we visit despite repeated attempts to say I can't eat it. Don't want to stop visiting or be rude. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The company i work for purposefully don't list prices on its website because it wants you to fill out its shitty form with your details so you become a lead for them and they can contact you til you sign up. As a UX designer, i hate this, but the marketing department won't let us change it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finally signed up to the gym today, along with two personal training sessions. Only had salad today  for lunch and have my meals planned for the week.

My partner and I decided to focus on only one thing this year each. And we prioritize that rather than a few things. Mine is weight loss, hers is managing her diabetes.

I got sick of saying "I don't have time". I changed to saying "it's not my priority". But then when applying that to weight loss and health, it seemed silly that it wasn't my priority. 

Anyway, that's my small win for the week.  </TEXT>
