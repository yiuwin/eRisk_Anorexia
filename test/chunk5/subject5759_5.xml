	<TEXT> This is an awesome example of a **hydrofoil**.

Under the water effectively is a wing, it behaves in the same way as a plane wing. Often these can have their angle of attack adjusted too but it's unclear if the boat in the video can do that. 

There's a sweet spot where the extra energy being spent creating lift with this wing is less than the energy saved by having less drag (once the boat is out of the water there's only a very small part of the boat submerged creating drag, which makes hydroplanes not only awesome to watch but quite efficient.

	<TEXT> One thing worth pointing outand it's especially true with EDM is that build "ups" usually decrease, not in volume entirely but one or more bands. Analyse a few tracks and you'll probably find a common theme is to pass out the bass over the last bit of your build up. As other have mentioned, automate a high pass!

best of luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really depends on your genre and the song itself but we always find ourselves adding more layers to the build up / rise than we initially thought we would need. Risers and filtered noise work great, as I'm sure you probably already know.

My tip would be to experiment by subtracting down an instrument that's prominent after the drop, in our case (DnB) it's often the bass (not sub bass) that we modify slightly then build that into the riser / buildup also. This gives a nice lead in and can tie things together nicely.

We ALWAYS start with a clone of one of our basses / synths, simplify it and apply the effect we want (filter up, pitch up etc) meaning all our risers, even those covered in noise, sound familiar and somewhat 'introduce' the listener to the sound they're going to hear after the drop.

It's all personal preference really, but layers are important in your buildups and keeping things familiar in a scene of chaos (drops) is always good we find. 

Just my stream of consciousness. Sorry if it makes no sense ha </TEXT>

Hello!

We are Cryptography from London, making Drum   Bass. This is our, nearly complete single. We're not sure on the higher 'trumpet' sound towards the back of the tune but we're pretty happy with the overall sound.

I think we're so close to it however we can't really pick where it needs to go - any feedback or thoughts are appreciated it. 

Will get to listening to some of the already posted tunes over my lunchbreak :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ok! so this is a bit of a headfuck, but for whatever reason it works. The problem is the windows usb sound device that gets added to the launchkey. What we need to do is uninstall the windows driver then have the launchkey enable it itself. I'm not sure if that is the technical explanation, but it was I have perceived to have happened.

SO, here we go. I'm writing from memory while on my lunchbreak so sorry if something is confusing, more than happy to get this solution out there however as I've trawled forums and never found it.

Plug in your launchkey, open control panel and goto devices and printers.

bring up the properties of the launchkey25 listed there, you then want to go into the driver settings, there's a button on the properties screen on the bottom left of one of the panel that has the UAC icon (the shield) and the button 'change settings' or something similar. Go there,

Then inside the next popup, which looks similar to the first one we want to goto the driver tab and hit 'uninstall driver' this will take a split second and it will look like nothing has changed, now remove your launchkey from usb. 

You then want to close this window but no the first popup, plug in your launchkey again and wait a second. inside FL midi settings you'll either see launchkey appear after hitting rescan devices or you wont, if not repeat the steps again.

If this is super unclear let me know and I'll try get screengrabs for ya </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always try to mess around with the swing of the drums, it can bring a nice groove feeling at low levels 35% but a huge break style if you push up around 50%. It does change things quite a lot, so have a play; it can work well for some tracks.

Another thing is adjusting the volumes   dynamics of individual drum notes, mainly hi-hats I find brings a more human sounds out of the beat.

Also good naming conventions for your patterns is critical. Even a slight change makes seeing at a glance what something is a whole lot easier as long as you stick to a convention you find nice to use.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The more I hear about this, the more I am convinced we were one of the only completely fair doge gaming sites.

For video poker, our system had a simple array of cards, like

    0 = "King_Spades",
    1 = "Queen Hearts"

And it literally used a simple random number generator to choose cards from the deck, removing them as it went. It was quite easy to code (actually rigging the game would be harder I think). The hardest part was the hand solver, which I still never got working for a low straight starting at an ace.

In the end I spent about 200,000 doge after profit paying out the final refunds. I consider this quite cheap for what I learned running gambledoge.com and considering the wallet balance at refund time was around 256,000,000 I consider it quite lucky I didn't have to pay out more.

I think most casino games (and I only formed this opinion recently) for dogecoin are rigged, spare maybe a few sites. It's easy to throw cryptographic terms at users to 'prove' your system is fair but in the end the server holds the exact data of everything and it's not rocket science to have it confirm a win or a loss to seem legit, no md5 string or acronyms can stop that.

I'd love to have another dogecoin project, but I have no ideas at the moment. I really enjoyed programming the GambleDoge games and it'd be great to contribute more to the doge community. We'll see I guess.

Thanks for your support! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I've just seen this thread :(

Yes we closed, I refunded all dogecoin into their depositing accounts and shut the site down. As much as I'd love to continue to operate the site I just don't have the time to keep developing it and supporting the great players like you guys.

I coded the entire thing from scratch, including all the games - it'd be a shame to see it go to waste so if anyone has experience in Laravel PHP MVC you're welcome to the code. I don't think I'll open source it though as I can't support it.

	<TEXT> They have 2 different use cases really, although a solution can often use one or the other. An if statement is more about flow control while a case/switch is more aimed at identifying data.

If I need to check a single condition then I would use an if statement, I can then break or return the flow and have clean code after it for the false case. 

It's also alot nicer to read this:

    var d = 1;
    
    if(d == 1){
    return "Is one";
    }
    
    return "is not one"; </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happened in Auckland New Zealand. 

From memory the man underneath the helicopter was to make sure the cable was clear when the pilot released it from the helicopter. The call was made to release the cable but the cable did not drop. 

The man jumped expecting to be able to pull the cable out of the unlocked hook, but the tug from this brought the other half of the cable into the rotors and destroyed the helicopter.

It's debatable whether the pilot had released the hook or not and hard to place total responsibility on anyone. Great footage though. </TEXT>

I'm normally developing on a PC while I'm at home and we've now moved onto the IOS platform of our game. It's really annoying to have to wait to go into work to use xCode to build our test versions so I was wondering if there's any solutions to building IOS apps in the cloud? Perhaps a service that takes your xCode project and builds it?

I have an apple dev account etc, so just looking for suggestions on getting to run the project through xCode from my PC.

Open to any solutions, free or paid :) </TEXT>
