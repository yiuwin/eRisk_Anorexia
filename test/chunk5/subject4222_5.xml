	<TEXT> All I have to say is fuck Sean Murry. He told us there was gonna be this and that and all we got was a small portion of what the game was supposed to be. It was cool the the first forty hours but then when there is no true goal or building, or any kind of story then it sucks. Where are the factions and the different ship types with different uses and handling? Let alone the topic of this discussion. Please anyone who sees Sean Murry in the street...punch him in the nuts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is the point of Sony's involvement in this. The were the muscle behind the advertising. I understand that a class action lawsuit would be the way to go, but it really isn't about the money.

Jack shit. 
Most of the time it's bigger fauna rooms or just resource cashes that are a joke. After all that time of trying to get one and recieving it all I find is crap. 
Of anyone else out there has one and had found something cool please tell me what you found. This is sadning for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I pre-ordered this game for the pc. I still have two more days till I get to play it. With that said, I'm still hyped to play it. I have watched so many youtube videos about the game (pre-launch) that my hype never went away. I have played and logged so many hours into minecraft and starbound that it's crazy. This game is gonna put both together and multiply it by a thousand. I have watched at least three hours of people streaming it from ps4 and I'm still hyped. This has been the most anticipated game (for me) for the last two years. Just two more days...  </TEXT>
