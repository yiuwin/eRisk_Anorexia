	<TEXT> But it would be great to hear him tell what it was really all about. I'm from the south and so I always hear a completely different take on it as opposed to what actually happened. It would be nice to hear a rational, non biased, factual point of view. And it's the only war the country has ever had amongst itself, which I think is pretty important, especially considering the way things are going now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the taste of meat, not fat and gristle. Leaner meat has that meaty taste. And I love venison, throw some salt on it, cook it slow on a grill or smoke it and it's awesome. And like venison some cuts of grass-fed beef are tougher, but you just have to know how to cook them. Blind taste test? No, but I can taste the difference. I've eaten grain-fed maybe a handful of times over the past few years, and the taste I get from it is always bland and watery. Not much going on with it. But it's just a preference I've grown to like and appreciate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's just a preference. It eat 90/10 beef anyways so I'm wanting beef lower in fat which is why I go for it. I will say bigger cuts of meat can be tougher if you don't take your time and cook it low and slow. Those links aren't very good sources. The Mayo Clinic one points out how much healthier it is. An of course the Omaha Steaks website is going to say that grain-fed is better. Read [this] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846864/) . And I buy my beef from a farm that's about 20 minutes away. I like it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great article, very informative. All the beef I buy is grass-fed, and you can definitely taste the difference. Glad to know there are some things that i need to look out for though. </TEXT>
