	<TEXT> I'm a social media engagement manager. I am in an office most of my day, once in a while meeting with clients in their offices or at events we may be running to cover for social media platforms, but rarely. I do often have days FULL of meetings, which can be stressful when not feeling well, but i work at a laid back digital agency and with a boss who knows my IBS issues and is accommodating. I still try to do the best I can, despite often being late, or sometimes leaving early if I'm having really bad D or nausea. Somehow it hasn't affected performance as I've gotten a promotion as well as two raises in the 2 years ive been there, but i do have a serious fear it one day will get called out. </TEXT>

And now im freaking out im going to be sick, even though it was just a thin slice. I can't stop thinking about it. Does anyone else just feel super aware of things like that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the feedback. I already saw my Dr yesterday as we booked the 1 month later appointment immediately after I was prescribed. Didn't work even after a full month. I'm back on lexapro, which I took and worked a couple of years ago. I just wanted to try and move to something that wasn't brain chemistry altering but clearly is what I need. Fun times, I'm going through the upfront shakes and palpitations all over again until I get used to it in my system.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So there's this new...noise and feeling i get, only during my worst BMs, so probably once every few weeks. Suddenly I'll be pushing, maybe slightly straining but not much...and then on my left side you can audibly hear this loud gurgle noise as i push and i can like...FEEL it. Any time it happens it freaks me the F out. If i push again, it'll happen again, with the pressure of pushing. I have never experienced this in my life, does anyone else get this? It often happens when i feel like im at the very end of multiple bad BMS, like my stomach is empty yet is still trying to go. it feels like as if an empty stomach is trying to push out nothing and thats the response. Should i be concerned this is something more serious? </TEXT>

I have  bigger 8 day trip planned in january but a friend of mine and I couldn't wait so we booked a short one about 6 weeks ago :) I will also be picking up my brand spanking new AP for the first time and I'm really excited about it!

some of you might know I vlog (on Youtube as the same name as my reddit username, IvyWinter) So yes, there will be vlogs. 2 of those days will be mostly solo so if that's your jam or you are thinking about a solo trip I'll be sure to capture that. I'll also be periscoping AND instagraming. SO MUCH SOCIAL MEDIAS.

I'm SO PUMPED I only have 3 more work days until the world :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its funny because for years from high school on i always had nervous belly. Even for exciting things. Job interviews, big tests, etc always brought about a bowel movement response, though not D. And now suddenly im suffering from IBS for the last 4 years. I wonder if people with "nervous belly" have more of a chance of having worse issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> to add to this, i personally love knowing that if i want to see Fantasmic every darn night, without have to go to HS all day every day, I can. If i want to spend my day in AK and have dinner at Epcot to catch Illuminations, a plan I actually have upcoming, I can. If im going with a big group, as I often do, and we split up, i like the flexibility to make a decision to go meet them wherever they are, and not have to say "oh sorry guys today is an MK day, can't make it to hollywood studios at all to meet you." Im a BIG planner, to a T, but even i know things can change last minute and I want to have the flexibility to do so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend got frustrated a couple of weeks ago when i kicked him out of the bathroom, twice, one morning as he was trying to get ready for work. He gets i don't feel well, but in that moment he was like "Really? you need to go this many times?" For me, the emotional reaction was just tears :-/ He gave me a big hug and apologized later, but it made me feel like my IBS is not only affecting me but now others around me and i hate it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work 40+ hours a day at a digital agency. and yeah, there are days im often in the bathroom, trying to hurry up and not miss a meeting. Find an environment that is flexible. for the most part, if im a few minutes late to a meeting, or have to run out in the middle, my account team understands. I don't tell them explicitly WHY but life happens. My boss knows about my IBS and if im late, it's fine. I just make up that time at the end of the day. I've managed 2 raises and a promotion in my almost 2 years at this job, so it IS possible to work AND be successful. Just gotta work a little harder than everyone else ;) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How Long Until Viberzi Worked Well (For Those On It)? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-25 18:13:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all. I just started Viberzi on Saturday, 1 pill twice a day, 100mg. Saturday I was ok, no BMs (my last one was early friday evening, i had D at work around 6pm), Sunday i was bloated and gassy but no BMs. This morning I woke up and started off with a normal BM (whoa, unheard of). No pain. But it quickly degraded into 3 more BMs of my usual loose stools + passing gas at the same time. Less pain than usual, which was a plus, but still, going 4 times in an hour isnt what id call major improvement. Thats my usual bad morning. That said, i know its only been 2 full days on the meds. Anyone with experience find it took some time to feel normal? anyone feel like it never worked? Im willing to give it a full week before making any real judgements but man i was hoping all those stories i read of "it worked right away!" would be me :-/ **EDIT:** It's been over a week and viberzi hasn't made a huge difference. Still D 50% of the days. Im going to continue it until my dr appointment on the 15th but i don't think ill be continuing if i don't suddenly see signs of improvement. *sigh* </TEXT>

Ran to my work bathroom in a hurry, passed some gas, had D. I know that its likely food from even yesterday and that the digestive system isnt as cut and dry as what you eat every day coming out within 24 hours or anything, but im still just so frustrated. I need to leave and go home soon and now I'm dreading my commute. thank yoooou IBS. I did get a prescription for viberzi yesterday from my dr but my pharmacy had to order it in and it's not there yet :-/ all I can do right now is cope with imodium. I am so, so tired of being sick. It's been the worst it's ever been the past 3 months or so. </TEXT>

If the room isnt ready i have them hold my bags and just go off to the parks! I am taking a later flight in january, getting in around 4:30pm, and i still think i may do a leisurely evening at night. I am an adult with no kids though who usually goes with friends, so keep in mind its easier for me to do stuff like that. YMMV with kids in tow! </TEXT>
