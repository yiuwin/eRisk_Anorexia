	<TEXT> Everyone really shouldn't.  Unions are great for a specific company, trade, or skill.

Should Wal-Mart or McDonalds workers have a union?  Probably not, its entry-level work that is honestly easily replacable.  Any skilled trade or profession makes unions to make sure you're paid a good competitive market rate, and that you're compensated fairly.  My union handled my pension and benefits.  McDonalds workers get paid minimum wage, or a hair above it, and they don't have a pension (and never are going to).  So a union is pretty useless there.  There is really almost nothing to negotiate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats fine.  But if we treat weed that, we have to be consistent.  That mean other big risks like alcohol, tobacco, and deployment have to be treated like that too.  Hell, alcohol is more dangerous to a fully grown adult than even the most pessimistic study says weed is for developing brains.

And I have a little bit of an issue with how the legal system works.  Right now, if you turn 18 you take on all of the responsibilities of being an adult.  You are responsible for your own health, your own finances, and your own well-being.  If you commit a crime, you are fully responsible as an adult.  So if we hold someone as an adult in every other aspect, how can we then refuse to give them the rights of an adult?  I don't think its fair to say that being 18 comes with all the responbilities of being an adult, but none of the rights.  If we trust people with one, it needs to come with the other. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Much better, mainly for 2 reasons.

1) They use direct compensation, as does Ontario.  So you go to your own insurer if you're in an accident no matter whether you were at fault or not.  Your insurance company won't go after the other insurer even if you weren't at fault to recover money.  Saves lots of money.  But mainly: 

2) They don't allow any personal injury lawsuits.  If you are hurt, the government covers your costs.  The amount minor (and frankly, mostly fraudelent) whiplash lawsuits cost insurers every year is ridiculous.  So it kills off all the fraudulent cases, and avoids all the costs of litigating in lawyer fees, administrative work, etc.  Those that are really hurt still get good care.  Also saves drivers a ton of pain in the ass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many if not most people aren't aware of the medical risks of drinking, but they still drink.  And if you start at 18, we aren't even certain there is an additional risk at all (see [here](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/11/marijuana-brain.aspx) and [here](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170125214606.htm)).

If we are going to pick and choose ages, then we have to at least be consistent.  That means raising the ages for alcohol, tobacco, and deployment too, probably all higher than marijuana.

Or we can set an age of majority and let people make their own decisions, recognizing they may make some poor ones.  Also recognizing most people may not know the risks, but thats to their own detriment.  But recognizing that people need the freedom to make their own decisions and their own choices, and the government shouldn't babysit us on every little decision. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree.  But like I said, if anything, deploment is way worse.  And alcohol and tobacco are definetly worse.  So if we are going to follow that line of reasoning, if marijuana is 21, deployment is probably 25.  Alcohol and tobacco are also higher.  So that line of reasoning doesn't make any sense for raising marijuana but nothing else.  And all of this relies on an [iffy conclusion](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/11/marijuana-brain.aspx) that marijuana is harmful to developing brains.

I'm a much bigger fan of just saying "There, you're 18.  Make your own decisions now, even if they're stupid".  Instead of going around in circles about when you can take on every individual risk (military, tobacco, alcohol, weed), I believe at a certain age, you get full personal freedom over ALL your own choices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It definetly does.  That specific study found pretty conclusively 17 was safe.  But other studies have found other ages.

Its also very possible it doesn't harm the developing brain at all.  Untangling marijuana's effects from other drugs, alcohol, and other factors has proved extremely difficult.  The above study actually admitted that the effects on those that start at 14 could very likely be more explained by things that normally go with starting drugs at an early age (dropping out, attending class less, etc).  We need a lot more research, but it really isn't conclusive if or to what degree marijuana is harmful to developing brains. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yeah, if it wasn't clear that proposal involved cutting the social services entirely.  So they would stop using social services, because they wouldn't exist anymore.

I mean, that's already about 27% of the federal government's yearly budget right there.  So getting to $10,000 a year would involve roughly 100% of the government budget - as in no money for absolutely anything else if it was not coupled with tax increases.  Now the provinces do provide some social programs as well, so I haven't accounted for those.  

The other X factor would be the effect on the economy.  Perhaps it would stimulate the economy by reducing inequality or increasing efficiency and create more tax revenue on the other end, but that's really a total unknown at this point.

It just seems ridiculous to me when people go around suggesting UBI like it's the answer to all of our problems.  Realistically, most people haven't even taken a look at the numbers of what it would take to make UBI work.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One model I've seen involves killing current social programs and replacing it with UBI.  Theoretically, it would be more efficient.

Canada spends [$72.2 Billion](https://www.fin.gc.ca/tax-impot/2014/html-eng.asp) last year on "transfers to persons", which includes EI, old age security, guaranteed income supplements, children's benefits, and allowances for spouses.  Digging around a little more, you can find an extra [$3 Billion](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/inpr/afhoce/afhoce_021.cfm) annually in social housing funding.  

That's for a total of $75.7 Billion.  Assuming you completely eliminated all of those things, you could provide a universal basic income of $2080 annually to every Canadian, or about $173 a month.  You might be able to push it a little higher if you wanted to exclude children as well but I wouldn't do that.  So not exactly an encouraging number.  

That model has its criticisms too.  Most of those programs are aimed at those in need, elderly, or the unemployed.  UBI would be indiscriminate, Bombardier's CEO gets $173 a month too.  Combine that with the fact that I'm unconvinced it would do a better job.  Yes, it would be more efficient.  But a lot of that money would also go to people that don't need it.  

At this point, I don't see a way we could fund it with a significant payout of any kind that wouldn't involve some pretty big tax increases somewhere.  Not to discount the idea, I'm not writing it off, but we have to be realistic about what an implementation would look like. </TEXT>

But you're asking great questions.  So many people that love this model have no answers to those questions.  There isn't a working model of this anywhere in the world, so we would have to create it ourselves.

People act like UBI is an easy solution.  Its not.  It would be very difficult to implement, and there is a *ton* of question marks involved.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check [out Lazards cost analysis](https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-analysis-100/).  It includes both subsidized and unsubsidized costs.

That may have been true in the past, but not so much anymore.  Yes, they are subsidized.  However, as you can see they are completely competitive, if not more cost-effective even without the subsidies.  

Hope this helps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, thats very true.  Reserve funding varies a lot.

Maybe.  Thats surprisingly difficult to pin down, theres a lot of disagreement there.  [This report](http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/native-education-problems-wont-be-fixed-with-more-funding-study-says) says they actually recieve significantly more funding, not less.  [This report](http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/thunder-bay/first-nations-education-funding-gap-1.3487822) would probably agree with you.

Personally, I think we should drop the current system and just fund those schools like normal schools. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although true, it [doesn't mean its working](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/7-questions-about-first-nations-accountability-1.1331320).  In short, it seems our audits are more focused towards "where" the money is spent as opposed to actual performance.

I still think we do have some huge accountability issues.  At the latest information available, [over 80 Chiefs and band councillours made more than the Prime Minister](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/some-native-chiefs-earn-more-than-pm-tax-watchdog-1.879890) for example.

You're correct.  They undergo a ridiculous amount of auditing and reporting.  The problem is, its not working.  Why?  I'm not really sure.  But I do think we need to change something.  Why are we spending so much money and getting so little results (apologies for generalizing though, some reserves are in excellent condition).

TL;DR There is definetly a problem. I don't know what the solution is, but its definetly not more auditing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because companies have the right to pay their CEOs as much as they like, its not the governments job to decide for them.

Look at all the most innovative major companies in the world.  Their CEOs make a killing for a reason.  Their top executives make the money they do for a reason.  If Canada is supposed to have companies on that level, you can't then handicap their ability to draw top talent.  Imagine telling a Canadian engineering firm they have to compete on the world stage, but they can only pay their engineers $50,000 a year max.  Guess how that would go?  Very, *very* poorly.  This is no different. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Check out this read](http://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/why-concerns-over-carbon-pricing-are-misplaced/).  Particuarly interesting is when he discusses economic impact; in short, its miniscule and can be mitigated.  However, he does a great job summarizing carbon taxes in general in good detail.

You can also [read this one](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602857/canada-moves-ahead-on-carbon-taxes-leaving-the-us-behind/), but the really relevant quote is "Most academic studies find that British Columbias tax is reducing carbon emissions by 5 to 15 percent without hurting economic growth".  

Lowering emissions doesn't have to decimate the economy, quite to the contrary you can usually do it with *very* low economic impact, and still make good progress.  It might even amount to a net-positive even in the short-term,  emissions and climate change have large costs associated with them.  </TEXT>

I'm also thinking that if you're the CEO of a fast food restaraunt, average worker probably makes almost nothing.  If you're CEO of a high tech firm, average worker makes far more.  Doesn't mean that that CEO should be paid more.

But your right.  That solution isn't workable I think.  The things you suggested would be better tools. </TEXT>

Why be CEO of a company here for 300K when you can be a CEO of an American company of the same size for 5 Million?  It would probably make it impossible to get or retain top end talent.  Companies would do everything they could to base themselves elsewhere just to avoid that law.
