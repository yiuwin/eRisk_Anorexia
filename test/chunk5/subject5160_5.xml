	<TEXT> I did watch the video, but i also read the wikipedia article right after watching it which says it was hit with 22 hellfires during the test. A frigate can certainly be sunk with 22 hellfires, remember that this was an unmanned target ship, so the damage control systems are limited. </TEXT>

As far as i know, Bigelow was trying to convince NASA to ultilize the BEAM module more often than just the handful of tests originally planned but as far as i know nothing more has happened. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If he wants to watch something similar, i would recomend Record of Lodoss War. Its a medival fantasy anime, without the rape and nudity. It does have violence in it so it might not be for a 7 year old, though not the level of gore that Berserk does. There also other classic sword and sorcery type stuff out there thats more kid friendly like movie the Black Cauldron (there is a demon and some undead beasts in this), the Disney movie the Sword in the Stone, or the old disney TV show Gummy Bears for instance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would wager that .3 G would have little long term impact on the physiology human body, as long as there is sufficent gravity that the body can tell which way is up and which way is down i imagine it would develop properly. What exactly that lower limit is where problems start to occur is a question  that will need to be solved eventually though. I imagine that there might be major problems that could occur on very small asteroids which have practically no gravity. </TEXT>

At the same time though, the Earth is where humans are best suited to live so it would be wise to keep the Earth in a happy-healthy state as long as scentifically possible. If we ever do want to move out and live amongst the stars, we need to be sure that we keep the Earth tidy and in good working order so as to ensure that Humanity at the very least survives long enough to reach those other worlds. </TEXT>

However, they found out that they couldnt do that either, so they dumbed down the mission to simply pluck a boulder and move it to Earth orbit which led to its unpopularity and ultimate demise since it was but a shadow of the glorious daring mission that was originally planned. </TEXT>

The international legal framework surrounding space travel prohibits countries from claiming soveriegnty over celestial bodies such as the moon, but it says absolutely nothing regarding the ownership of mined materials ect. There have even been cases in the United States involving the ownership of moon rocks, which indicate that one can claim legal title to resources recovered from a celestial body like the moon in the same manner as one can from unclaimed areas of the earth like oil and fish from international waters of the ocean for example. </TEXT>

[Then in the 1990's there were the design reference missions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xpja3jsYO8) which were canceled in favor of the ISS. Part of the problem that has plagued NASA since the Apollo program ended has been changing priorities with each new administration.
