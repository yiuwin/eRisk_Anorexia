	<TEXT> I did try to make the text white but because I'm using opacity when I turn it white I can not read the text. If I could change the opacity of the text without affecting the opacity of the image/border behind it would show </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should I take a web dev. program at my school? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My local university UTA offers web dev. tracks that end with a certification of completion. Ive been using freecodecamp and other resources online to learn, but  It would be great to have in class lessons with a real teacher. only problem is i can barely afford it(financial aid doesn't cover it).is it worth spending 3 to 4 thousand on a program? Taking classes would also calm my family who are just waiting for me to do something like this, but can't financial back me up either.
