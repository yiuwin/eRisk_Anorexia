	<TEXT> I haven't been able to complete the whole series ,but this quote seems to me a beautiful combination of the old word wisdom .There is a famous Irish proverb that says "Beware the fury of a patient man" .Similarly ,in many old civilisations,night with no moon is considered inauspicious,the time when evil forces are strongest ( Indians call such night Amavasya) and sea in storm is so obvious 
What do you think ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all you have spatulate fingers which shows that you love adventure ,have lot of energy ,good imagination but a little impatience 
The joined heart and head line ( simian line ) shows that you are very focused and intense.You are also a perfectionist and maybe a bit stubborn !
It also denotes ambition and an introverted personality.
In Asian palmistry ,a mark in the palm is considered a symbol of hidden enemy or an ill wisher ( usually it means that the person on whose hand it's found will be so successful to have many jealous enemies !) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So wonderful ,looks like a scene from the detective/thriller movie .If you ponder it for a long time ,you feel the night talking to you ,divulging its inner secrets:
I love the silent hour of night,
For blissful dreams may then arise,
Revealing to my charmed sight
What may not bless my waking eyes. </TEXT>
