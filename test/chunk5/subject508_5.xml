	<TEXT> It's an error; Both an error on CW's part and How it was aired in the first place. Back when Season 3 aired; (Bare with me it's sort of a loaded explanation) We were given Episode 327 (Going by prod. number) The first time aired, it was uncensored and the Drew game was actually Quick Change! And this episode was aired during the 10PM slot rather than the original 8PM slot, (Also being dubbed as "Too Hot For 8PM"); Even odder is that 327 was aired back-to-back with ep 326(Episode prod number 326), and was actually made to seem like one episode (Even 327's credit reading was slashed to make it seem as if it was one episode. Heck originally, 326, the episode that followed, had Brad Sherwood listed in the credits!). That was the first airing of that episode anyhow. 

The story for episode 334 (What I believe is listed as ep 322 on CwSeed??) was with its original airing, Props was the Drew Game for that one. Both episodes were re-edited for syndication, Both episodes swapping Drew Games (327 getting Props, 334 getting Quick Change); 327 getting re-edited and censored (For the If You Know What I mean line) to make less raunchy.

What I'm pretty sure happened with CW Seed is. WB gave them the original tape to Episode 334, but was given the Re-Edited Episode 327. 

and That was Whose Line History 101! XD </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is ENOUGH! Look, The Celebrity crap was started during Season 5, It was a damn trend, Every Season 5 taping there was had 1-2 Celebrity Guests; and if it wasn't for a High Episode count (For Season 5) and Season's 6-8 (Being totally made up from previous season tapings, except for one taping) It would have the exact same feel. 

I think that maybe we should be thankful that the show's back at all! and you know what? Since Season 10 (We aren't counting Season 9 since it was pretty embarrassing) the New Seasons have actually been good. End of Discussion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously?! ENOUGH! Brad was in more games than the guest. If you must complain about something, and something good; Complain about the editing. Literally you have a 3 hour taping, consisting of 20-24 games; Guests taking up 3-5 games there, Then the rest of the time its different games and it involves the fourth seater, a lot (unless Colin and Ryan game or Greatest Hits on a show that involves a non singing fourth seater, but I digress). Find the editor, maybe a CW representative(?) and then send them your complaints, tell them you want more variety in the game line ups or such. 

And you know, guests have been hit or miss this season; Heather was a hit in the two games she was in; (Btw be thankful cause it could've been 3-4 games. But thankfully the editor was wise to cut that down) </TEXT>

Sitting out of (Most likely 3 games, if you're Brad) (4-5 out of 20 for a non-singing fourth) only a few select games isn't going to break a fourth seater.

Let me say, It took me a little while to get used to Aisha. I absolutely adore her as host now. Yes I loved Drew, still do; but I've gotten used to Aisha's hosting and up to this point she's gotten used to the gig and really has come out of her shell. Fantastic host.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Regardless of it not being the most popular thing on the show, and perhaps they won't be on nearly every episode in the future; But if you were in charge of selecting who guest starred for each taping, who would you pick?

-Cannot be a special guest that has already appeared during the show's run
-Can be special guest fourth seaters that have appeared before
-Be Creative!

	<TEXT> I was dreading the question. It should be "Do you prefer Clive, Drew, or Aisha?" But since we're on this question, I'm starting to prefer Aisha; Don't get me wrong I'll always have a place for Drew in my heart, as well his time as Whose Line Host. Aisha so far has brought a new dynamic, and starting Late Season 10 to the new season right now, she's really upped the energy, practically matching Drew's. She's fantastic.

Now if this were a "Do you prefer Clive, Drew, or Aisha?" question, then I might have a problem even coming up with an answer, because I love all three! </TEXT>
