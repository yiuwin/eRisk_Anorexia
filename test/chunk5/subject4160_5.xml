	<TEXT> Really? I always thought it was a League reference cuz Rammus is ultra-fast and this thing's title is "the Supersonic," so it doesn't seem so far fetched to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Caine. It doesn't sound too ridiculous, is fairly unique, and has a skell to match (Verus Cain). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ramus the Supersonic in Sylvalum is a reference to the League champion Rammus, a giant armadillo-Sonic the hedgehog thing that's mostly known for being the fastest thing in League, so it makes sense why an atrygon, something that literally zips around at the speed of sound (screwing over my camera in the process), would have such a name </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Monolith Soft has succeeded in creating the most hated video game character of the generation (lmao), I don't know anyone who likes Tatsu, even though his Chapter 11 scene is supposed to be his Fallen Arm scene, it just falls flat and has none of the depth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> huh.... This formula is actually rather simple.... Maybe it cuz I'm fresh off my Stats and Calc tests, but once again, thanks for showing me this, but I do take issue with the attribute resistance total part of the formula, assuming it comes from the ENEMIES attribute resistances (probably wrong here) then we should be dividing by Attribute Resistance total instead of multiplying. However, if its your own, then the formula is correct. Could you clarify this for me, as the Internet isn't very forthcoming when it comes to math (however simple) in videogames? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, wow! Thanks for writing all this up, I'm definitely convinced that Inner Search is the way to go, 700+ potential here I come!

Edit: Switched to Inner Search and now Blossom Dance can hit into the upper 2 millions per hit. Thanks a bunch for setting my mind at ease! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Ether Boost vs. Inner Search? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Ok so I've got a pretty good Blossom Dance build with around 600 potential, so my question is if I kick off Ether Boost for Inner Search, how this will affect my overall DPS (factoring in TB, TSE, and RB), and if the extra potential is worth losing that 50% boost to ether damage? </TEXT>
