	<TEXT> I am required by my curriculum to write a 6-12 page investigation on a topic of my choice in physics for high school. I've chosen the Young's modulus, my other choice was using the Bernoulli's equation somehow. But my school is not equipped with the best apparatus, so Searle's method is not possible. Is it possible for me to write a 6-12 page investigation on this or is it too simple? What do you suggest? </TEXT>
