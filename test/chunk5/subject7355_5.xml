	<TEXT> Starts off really well. I wake up at around 10-10.30 and make a mean breakfast of eggs and bacon, I then do nothing all day but lay on the sofa and watch movies. When it gets to about 8.30 I become very anxious as I remember that I have a week of work beginning the following day. This is followed by the inability to get to sleep at a good time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wise words from old people. My grandpa told me "everybody feels down at times, no matter the front they portray. You could be envious of somebody who you think has it all, but little do you know they are having very much the same emotion as you"

And it is true EVERYBODY feels low at times. Its unnatural to be happy smiley all the time.when I see someone like that I now see that they may be building up a lot in their head and faking happiness to appease people around them.

Don't worry my friend. It will pass  </TEXT>
