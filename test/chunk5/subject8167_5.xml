	<TEXT> Hey Reddit,
I've had a rat infestation for a few months now, and have called exterminators to put down poison. it did work, until a week later I saw a huge rat run across my kitchen floor. Ever since, I've been deathly afraid of rats being in the house, to the extent that it's causing me to be hyper vigilant and imagine rats in the corner of my vision, or scurrying across the floor. Is this normal, or could this be a sign of something bigger?

Thanks for any responses in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a combination of anonymity and deindividuation. Deindividuation makes us feel less inhibited, thus less accountable for our actions and what we say on the internet. Anonymity shifts us into an "agentic state" that kinda feels as if you're a different person on the internet, taking on perhaps a more confident or "straight-forward" persona, thus performing actions on the internet (such as ranting or venting) which you wouldn't do in real life due to fear of being socially humiliated and the desire to be liked. </TEXT>
