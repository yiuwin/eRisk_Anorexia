	<TEXT> Battlefield isn't as much about good aim as other games are. Movement is a lot more important. Try flanking the enemy and then attack them from behind. Works especially well in Rush and Operations. Also, you should never stand still. If you do, you will get killed pretty fast.
Keep playing medic and support. You've seen everybody rage about never getting revived. Show that it's not everybody. As support, always dish out ammo. Few people ever do and it earns you a ton of points.
And remember: he person on top of the table usually isn't the on with the best KD </TEXT>
