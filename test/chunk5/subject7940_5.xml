	<TEXT> I bought it by the time, but I enjoyed it the most recently when I understand it better as I was too young back then.

It is a great album, indeed, full of special tracks in a row.

About the other album of choice, you should try it as the community seems to support good quality art.

I have to say I have never listened, but I have just seen the cover and it looks like a nice challenge.

I mean, at least, you will have my support! </TEXT>

The parallax caught my attention the most and it was enough to amaze me.

You really should take this other [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/5nt17l/newbiecctiny_city_chase_scene/dcfsb56/) into consideration, if you still want to perfect it, because it is an amazing scene.

In spite of being clearly a scarf, the way it is is cool because it is possible to see something as if the tree was frozen while trying to capture a frozen owl.

	<TEXT> After you create your artworks, you can post them on the [web app](https://e5kmd.app.goo.gl/ngbx) I develop: it is there so as to register authors and to publish multimedia content.

In order to create an artwork in itself, I can say I have a good past experience with [Autodesk SketchBook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adsk.sketchbook) on my old iPad 3, so, I guess it must be a good option for a new Android device; on the tablet, I use [Autodesk Graphic](https://graphic.com/) oftenly, but its unfortunately unavailable for Android.

You can take a look at some works I created with both in order that you have a proper opinion about them: [SketchBook's](https://quaestio.org/category/sketchbook/) and [Graphic's](https://quaestio.org/category/graphic/).

As an user of Autodesk's apps, I would also recommend you to read more about [Autodesk Ink](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adsk.sketchbookink_gen), but I can not say much because I have never used it myself.

By the way, when searching about Autodesk Graphic for Android, I have found this [list](http://alternativeto.net/software/idraw/?platform=android) with alternatives in my way to answer you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cara, e o pior  que o uso desse servio acabou "traumatizando" o pessoal acerca de links externos.

 muito complicado oferecer uma breve sada a um link externo de um site, pois os usurios j se acostumaram mesmo a fazer tudo por ali.

Tipo, como tem operadoras que facilitam o acesso a esse servio as vezes no cobrando pelo acesso simples, hoje h tipo um medo de clicar em um link externo por parte dos usurios.

Sem contar que o mau uso do servio tambm serviu muito para a descrena na internet em geral.

Alm disso, eu ainda diria que  um site que rene muitos usurios que no entendem muito bem como usar seus dispositivos tampouco sobre as utilidades da internet.

Assim, como webmaster de um [site/aplicativo](https://e5kmd.app.goo.gl/Cavx) que serve para o registro e a publicao de trabalhos autorais, a minha experincia com o Facebook no  muito boa em termos de resultados, porm, est sendo muito til para reunir usurios do servio que desenvolvo e at encontrar usurios em potencial, mas tenho de perder muito tempo ali para tanto e administrar fanpages l se tornou algo bastante impraticvel, principalmente, se o seu servio  gratuito, pois  essencial o uso de anncios atualmente para obter engajamento.

Infelizmente,  incomparvel, mas se voc notar o suporte que o Pinterest d a webmasters hoje, voc percebe que as ferramentas do Facebook poderiam ser muito melhores e no devem ser propositalmente. </TEXT>

It is interesting to see the game seemingly alluding the mystery in the culture of Los Santos. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, it is not that simple because I guess my graphics are not at minimum and all the things look pretty normal most of the time, but this particular texture is not visible, along with another details, probably, I agree with you in this point.

I just guess it is good to know this is not a texture that is always there for everyone to see and my point here is sort of to ponder about the role this texture might play in the hunt.

With the experience of never being able to see that this sign has something written inside my own game, I would never think it is a key piece of the mystery and, even being optimistic, I would say it is some kind of minor tip or clue for the whole thing or even just a thing that solves itself apart from the main mystery; another point, in my case, I knew it exists because of this subreddit alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do not know if it is enough to debunk it or not, what I know is that this sign looks invisible in my computer, so, I would never be able to know how to solve it by its means.

I know discharging is a further step, indeed, but what I guess is that it can mean some kind of minor tip or clue, but maybe it is not a greater part of the mystery, I am not sure, because otherwise this texture should be visible to every player.

I mean, it is strange that I would, hypothetically, need to improve my graphics, just to see it normally, I do not know, I just find it ackward because this texture is really simple and it is all blurred in my game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw a similiar thing while I was trying to lucid dreaming daily last year.

I was having fully detailed dreams, even dreams where you recognize you are dreaming, then, once I woke up in the middle of the night and had a vision of a bright light really near me in the bed.

I really guess meditative-like exercises are really connected with it, since I was trying a lot of things related by the time back then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On my computer, I have never seen this sign because of the quality of the textures.

I would never know about the existence of this code if it was not a topic doubt about the game discussed here from time to time.

I mean, people use to think that the mystery must be solved on each platform it is available and if we use this interpretation as valid, as I can not see it in my game, maybe this sign could even be discharged from the hunt, I do not know.

Take a look at [how](http://i.imgur.com/gI2WUiG.jpg) I see this sign in my game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I thought in the past was something like overlaying the mural over it somehow and following a path from it or looking for what could be the other boxes and for places to fit the mural, for instance.

I guess this is a way to look at this, although, it is not a good attempt, but, by the nature that the Chiliad Mystery seems to have, it could be useful as some kind of minor confirmation or validation besides the mural in itself, at least. </TEXT>

Besides the automatic link, you can simply add a picture and link it to the address you want to, then, it is click/access.

It receives GIFs and slides well enough either. </TEXT>
