I also would like to meet Rookie and Mezo so I can personally thank them for this great job security. I was on the overpass at I-10 and right before Washington where the train runs by trying to figure out how they got there. I eventually figured it out and was not willing to go to such lengths to get what they did. So tonight I will have a bucket truck with me so I can hit it from the highway. And thank you Sergio for the Badass flash light you left behind. You shouldn't etch your name in things if your going to leave it behind for me.  But your secret is safe with me.

	<TEXT> Here is my simple suggestion that I've seen work with 3 co-workers. 1 dipped the others smoked. 

First buy [this](http://www.efun.top/eleaf-icare-starter-kit-650mah.html) its cheap and if for some reason it does not work out you won't be mad at yourself for spending $120

Second make sure you get [this liquid ](https://gaslightvapor.com/collections/e-liquids/mr-salt-e-liquids) 

People are going to recommend you buy all kinds of nice things. But IMHO start with this to get you off then start enjoying the hobby side of it. 

Good luck!!

Edit: That liquid is important. It's nicotine salts. Just do some research on it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone. I have a son that's 8 months old and would like to start saving for him and his future. I'm really on here to get some insider tips on what to do and what to avoid. Google can only tell you so much. My idea was to open an account and let it withdrawal set amount every Friday but still have the option to where grandparents can deposit money as well. I don't want anybody to be able to touch it besides him and when he at least turns 18. I would like it to generate some kind on interest as well. I read a little about a 529 plan but I would like to know other options. Thank you for your time.  </TEXT>
