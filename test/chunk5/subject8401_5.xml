	<TEXT> The Prairie Party understand this concern, and does not wish to poison any talks that would do such a thing. However, they believe that, if anything, The United States and the Midwest should be reunited, if only two nations can come together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As with the Prairie Party, the Texan Independence Party has decided to hold a referendum to Discuss the future of the party. As the party is currently extremely small, they have called all available registered members to take part in a forum to discuss the future of the Party and it's organization. Throughout a week-long forum, it was decided to, much like the Prairie Party, to set up a system of delegates similar to the two major parties. The decision of a head of party was a different matter, with many of the assembled individuals clamoring for the position. In the end, James King, a former House representative in the Texas Government, and a member of the newly formed party, was chose for the experience he has in politics. Coupled with this role, and the currently limited membership of the party, he is currently expected to be the Presidential candidate if the party does not increase much in size between now and the next election. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Prairie Party have met in Austin to discuss the future for their party and their leadership. The current delegates discussed many motions, such as the organization of their party and the selection process for Presidential candidates, to the Chair for their party. For the answers to the first two questions, they decided to not try and re-invent the wheel, and simply follow the examples of the Republican and Democratic Parties. As for the chair of the Party, The delegation decided upon Nathan Jones, a believer in The re-unification of Texas, The United States, and The Midwest, and a supporter of the NAA for the steps it takes to re-unite the United States with the Midwest, thus helping to return Texans to their roots. </TEXT>
