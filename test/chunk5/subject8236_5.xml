	<TEXT> I think my battery has gone pretty bad.. with Pokemon go on and with 1 amp charging(USB) the phone is still discharging instead of charging. basically just decreasing the rate of discharge. The default phone app takes longer than usual to pop up. Some apps have become slower to open instead of being faster. Android N has better features n cleaner look but I feel like Im compromising on my battery and some of the performance. </TEXT>
