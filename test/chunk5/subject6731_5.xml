	<TEXT> 4-HO-MiPT and MET in my experience. Ejaculated three times within 45 minutes after insufflating approximately 45mg of the latter; within three minutes of masturbating I would have another erection and an all-consuming urge to repeat. Almost nothing came out the third time, and luckily the plateau had ended and the trip was waning, so I retired. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I jerked off on 4-HO-MiPT one time. It was nice. Felt fine until this I walked past this really hot pedestrian (I assume it was a male, but I was too high to really notice); this gave me such a strong urge to masturbate that I went home for half an hour then went back out with my friends.

I highly doubt that 4-HO-MiPT is very neurotoxic at all. Mushrooms and LSD are not neurotoxic, so why would an analog of the former be neurotoxic? Also, I have never noted a feeling akin to MDMA while experimenting therewith. I HATE MDMA so much, but 4-HO-MiPT is one of my favorite substances. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it legal in Canada? If so, I would still request that they do not open it, but it isn't too big a deal. They can't legally prevent you from possessing a legal, totally unscheduled compound.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> MALT - anybody try it? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I have a quarter gram of MALT, recently released from one of the more popular vendors on the internet. I imagine it will be relatively close to DALT, but I believe that there is no information online. Does anybody have any to add, or must I be the first? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I usually fall asleep before the end of the trip. Only DMT analogs have I found to be insomnia-inducing. Indeed, when I'm feeling a bit bleh or don't feel like I've been sleeping properly, a good dose specifically of 4-HO-MET is what I consider to be good medicine. </TEXT>
