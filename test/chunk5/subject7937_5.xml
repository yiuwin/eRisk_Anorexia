	<TEXT> Just finished my NG+ run last week. Bought Dark Souls 2 : SotFS immediately. Played a good 20 hours in the last week. But something just doesn't click. Its an amazing game to be honest and in no way do I hate it. But I so love the atmosphere, mechanics of 1, I couldn't resist and started another character in DS1. Just can't get enough of DS1. My appreciation for this game gets deeper each day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone's first blind playthrough was pretty much like yours. No one knew much. And when people started reading item descriptions, paying attention to world design, boss design, they realised what this game truly had in store. The brilliance of the storyline is that it's never fully revealed. It's up to you to figure it out. Make your own speculations. 

There's always NG+ so don't worry and don't you dare go hollow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well Seath created the Moonlight Butterflies. So that explains their presence in the crystal caves. As for the taurus and capra in demon ruins, they were probably just copy pasted because development hell and time crunch. "Demon Ruins" still answers why those demons are there though. They were spawned by the chaos flame in Lost Izalith which is connected to demon ruins. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be an even greater experience if you would have done Gwyn first and then came across Soul of Cinder in DS3. I had completed DS1 first and then jumped to DS3. I distinctley remember when I finished the first phase of SoC and heard those three notes I literally dropped my controller out of awe and nostalgia. One of my most amazing moments in DS3. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fog wall with no bosses are what made DS1 an actual adventuring experience it was. You didn't know what to expect. Entering a fog wall only to end up in a calm looking room is ant-climatic as fuck. I miss those in the DS3 as all are only boss fight fog gates. </TEXT>
