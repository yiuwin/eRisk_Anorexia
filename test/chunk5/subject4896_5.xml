	<TEXT> I will try it out. I also found this mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=polish id=239794296. Maybe its worth a try as well. Also what game settings are best for war scenarios? I thought about large map on pangea (or communitas with one continent) with more civs than default to fill the space quicker. Do you have some recommendation? </TEXT>
