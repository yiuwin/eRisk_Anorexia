	<TEXT> My routine now is: 

In shower (every three days):

1. Cowash with Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle, just the roots
2. Detangle with 1tbs Tresemme Undone Conditioner
3. Comb with a wide tooth comb
4. Flip hair upside down and S2C with ~2 tbs Tresemme Undone Conditioner

After shower: 

1. Squish in ~1tbs Curls Hair Gel
2. Plop for 1hr-overnight (depending on what time of day I shower)
3. Diffuse using the pixie curl method 

For second and third day hair:

1. Sleep with hair in a pineapple and a satin cap
2. In the morning, spray water (with a dollop of conditioner mixed in) on hair 
3. Scrunch in water/conditioner 
4. Air dry or diffuse depending on how wet I got my hair

	<TEXT> A month ago I found this subreddit. Two days later, I posted this picture:

A few people asked me to post again after a month of CG, so here it is!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, it went better than I thought it would! My hair gets really knotty so I kinda laughed at the prospect of combing it before. It probably took me 5-10 minutes to do and usually 3-5 with a brush. Not so bad!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow what a compliment! Thank you! My hair grows very fast naturally, which probably isn't the answer you were hoping for. Once my hair is long, I keep it waist length with trims every so often. Sometimes the urge for a huge change comes over me and I chop 8 inches off. Always regret it, but it takes about a year to grow back. 

Edit: changed word </TEXT>
