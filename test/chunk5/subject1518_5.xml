	<TEXT> I sort of have the same issue with drinking water. I am in a constant state of dehydration. I have found a semi-solution, maybe it is something you could do as well? I've found that getting individual bottled waters and adding Mio flavorings to them and then freezing them until they are almost frozen solid makes them a nice, icy almost slushy like treat. Zero calories, zero carbs but it's fun to munch on and it helps me get water in but doesn't make me feel bloated or nauseated like drinking actual water. 

Sorry you're going through such a hard time. :/  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to a friend's house to spend Thanksgiving with him, his wife and kid. Not sure about Christmas plans yet. 

My roommate is going with me too and he will eat anything, so I have put a lot of thought into this....First I fill my plate up with things so I look normal. Then I will eat only the safe food - turkey breast. Then I say "I shouldn't have had such a big breakfast, I'm full already" and give my roommate everything left on my plate. 

I'm just trying to figure out how to stealthily take my food scale and weigh my portion out so I know exactly how many calories to enter in MFP without looking like a weirdo. LOL.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are Walgreen's EVERYWHERE in the US. Bronkaid is for sale behind the pharmacy counter. Just go to the counter and ask for it, explain that you are here on Holiday visiting family and left your Bronkaid back home accidentally. They shouldn't ask any questions other than wanting to see your ID. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I attempted to not weigh myself and eat at maintenance all week after passing out while out on a run, and having an embarrassing amount of "what is going on with you?" attention recently from friends/coworkers. I pretended to be normal. And now I'm about to drown in my anxiety over what I've eaten all week, and the things people have said, so I'm going to just drink til I puke or pass out and then wake up tomorrow and start a fast that lasts until I feel like stopping, if I ever do. Everyone else can butt out. I need my hunger back. It makes me feel calm. 

It's funny, no one gave two shits about me when I was 180 pounds, even though that was just as/if not more dangerous. And it affected my ability to be worth a shit at my job. But if you lose weight and start exercising, it becomes everyone else's business. Confuses the shit out of me.

Cheers to everyone drinking with me. And if you're not drinking, I'll have one for you! Sorry for the random ramble, but you guys are the only people who would understand. I just feel disgusted with myself, and scrutinized by everyone in my life. Blah. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've uploaded exactly one image of myself to Imgur to post in a progress thread here, and regretted it almost immediately. I haven't posted photos of myself in YEARS up til then, even to my own FB page, and that made me remember why. 

Humans can be so cruel, snide and petty. Just take the positive comments and fuck the douchebags that leave shitty ones. They're clearly the losers if all they have to do with their lives is belittle strangers on the internet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YES! I have put off getting more tattoos for so long because I didn't want my blubber tattooed. I'm planning a victory tattoo (or three...or five) with my Christmas bonus next month, so that's also my motivation to not gain any weight.

First one I know I'm getting is going to go on the side of my right leg, down to the ankle and it will be the lamp post from Narnia with the words "Courage, dear heart." Narnia has always been and will always be my favorite thing. (Which is hilariously ironic because I'm an atheist and it's a Christian series but C.S. Lewis is amazing and you don't have to be a Christian to enjoy his writing.)

I don't have the rest of my ideas fully finalized but I know I want to start my left sleeve and incorporate all of my favorite things into it - my dogs, music, something as a memorial to my best friend who died a couple years ago, etc. So many things I want, so little creativity lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My local Walmart has them for 98 each! But the four packs are $6 each lol. I do have a convenience store that orders the 24 pack cases for me and sells them to me at cost but it's still cheaper to buy them from my Walmart, so I buy there when they have them. They are pretty slack about keeping the supply up to speed with my demand though lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not even kidding when I say I consume a stupid high amount of caffeine. Typical day is 3-4 cups of high caffeine coffee, 3-4 Sugar Free Rockstars, and 3-4 EC stacks.

I am ADHD, and unmedicated, so I think the caffeine helps me focus. I have no adverse side effects that I'm aware of. I'm not abnormally hyper or anything from my consumption, and I don't particularly feel like it affects my hunger levels..but my tolerance is stupid high, so take my experience with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like the more weight I've lost, the more I hate my body. Like, before...I knew I was fat and so I hated myself for being fat and that was easy, because I hated all of me and could just tidily sum it all up into "you're fat". But now, I'm technically underweight, but there seems to be SO much more of myself to hate. Loose skin, ew. Jiggly thighs, gross. Flabby arms, disgusting. Stretch marks, omg no one can ever see me naked again. Etc. 

It's like, when I have moments of non-disordered thinking, my mind tells me that it's not my body I hate, it's me. Myself. My entire being. And no matter what I change about the outside, I'm still going to be this hideous, flawed thing inside. I have to change *that* if I ever want to be happy with myself on the outside. So yeah, I'm going to hate myself forever no matter if I weigh 200 lbs or 75 lbs lol. I'll never be happy, or at least that's what it feels like.

Sorry, I went all rambly. Basically, I just want to say I understand and   you're not alone but I hope you can find your happy place. 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine is usually electrolyte related. I know this sounds weird but, pickle juice. I drink pickle juice before bed every night, along with a magnesium/potassium/calcium/Vitamin D/Boron supplement once a day and I have not had those wretched cramps since. 

Broth is also helpful, but for some reason pickle juice is safe to me while broth is too foody to me, so...I stick with that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too HATE going to the mall but if you can brave it, go once. Try on jeans in American Eagle, Gap, Old Navy etc. Jot down sizes/styles that you like and that fit you. Then look for them on EBay and Swap.com. 

Seriously EBay has kept me from going bankrupt. I just got a pair of American Eagle skinny jeans in my size that look brand new for 99 plus shipping ($6.95) 

I mean, it still cost money but it is so much cheaper than buying anywhere else. 

I don't know what waist size you wear, but I found size 00 short on EBay, which is relatively impossible for me to find in store. So, hopefully you will have some luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After my carb filled weekend, I have been in horrible gastric distress. I apparently can't process sugar very well anymore. (yay...maybe that'll keep my dumbass from binging on cupcakes and ice cream ever again!) Last night for dinner, I knew I had to eat something super low carb and bland. I had a bag of the Green Giant Riced Cauliflower in my freezer, and so I figured what the hell. I just put salt and pepper on it and holy shit, seriously amazing. Only 2g net carbs and 20 calories per serving, or 8g net carbs and 80 calories for the entire package. It is super filling too. This is going to be my new go-to for dinner. Tonight I'm having it again with lemon pepper and a piece of grilled chicken breast. Freakin' amazing. 

Just though I'd share!

	<TEXT> I'm in. After the horrors of this past weekend, I have no choice. My rules for myself - 1) Get back on keto, no more carb binges because "I've earned them." Carbs kill my stomach, I need to remember how miserable I *still* am because I had cupcakes on freakin' Saturday. 2) Try to be realistic. Restricting below 500 calories a day works great for a while and then I lose my mind and binge. I can eat 1,000 cals and still lose, and I won't be as prone to binging. 3) Exercise more. I have been slacking. I need to make a point to exercise every day, no excuses. Eating 1,000 calories instead of 400 should help me with energy so I need to use it wisely.

Best of luck to everyone with their goals! </TEXT>

In some twisted, insane way, I feel like if I kill the monster I am inside, something better will come from it. Like a rebirth of sorts. I will be a "new, better me! Pure and loveable, without flaws!"

Logically I know there are not two of me, and killing "the monster inside of me" will kill the whole me, but I am not always logical so... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I can master today without blowing the entire weekend and starting my week in utter depression, maybe I will move to once a month with no limits. I'm already doing better than I have the past few weekends. I guess because I "let" myself cheat rather than trying to resist cheating and failing with a massive binge. I guess it took the forbidden fruit aspect away and now it's like "Well if I can have it, I don't want it." Stupid brain lol.

	<TITLE> "Controlled" cheat days </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-22 21:02:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm trying something today, to try to head off any binge urges.

I restrict all week, around 500 calories or lower and I eat a ketogenic  diet. I've lost over 100 lbs doing this, but lately, basically since dropping to "underweight" binging has become a thing. Pretty much only on the weekends. The cravings for something sweet become so powerful I can't think or do anything else until I quell them. Which, as soon as I eat even the smallest sweet, I get drowned in shame and sorrow until I feel so horrible I eat everything in sight. I tell myself I've ruined everything and then I shame eat all weekend. Mondays I start over, do well all week and then repeat the horrors of the previous weekend. 

Well, I decided to take a different approach this weekend and "allow" myself a controlled cheat day. I've set a calorie limit (2,000) to maintain a semblance of control, but anything I want and can fit in there I'm going to allow. For one day. So far so good. I'm at about 1,300 for the day but I have consumed like ten days worth of carbs, and that is making me anxious. So, maybe not so far, so good? I'm trying to keep the "well, you've fucked up everything anyways may as well eat that gallon of ice cream and 17 bags of Skittles" voice away. 

Don't really know where I'm going with this. Guess I hope someone can tell me it's okay, I haven't ruined everything. Maybe if there is anyone here that is knowledgeable about the keto diet, they can tell me falling off the wagon once in a while isn't the end of the world just because I've kicked myself out of ketosis.

Would love to hear about how everyone else incorporates cheat days and if they help you resist binging.

TL;DR: I ate oreos and my "I'm fine, everything is fine" facade is starting to crack. Halp.  </TEXT>

And tomorrow I'm working.
