I'm afraid to jinx myself but things have been going surprisingly well with my current plan. Granted it's only been 10 days but I haven't binged at all... I ate at maintenance Saturday and Sunday but that was planned because I spent those days with my guy. And the best part is I'm back to losing consistently!

I lift weights MWF, I run TTh, and I swim Saturday mornings. So my plan has been 1000 (or less but hitting at least 100g of Protein) calories on the days I lift, and 500 (or less) on the days I run. 

I feel like I always get messed up right before/around when my period starts but I don't know if the cravings are the result of me getting my period or if it's just my fucked up internal binge-monster using my period as an excuse... in any case I have three weeks before my cycle ends so hopefully willpower wins out this time around. </TEXT>

Things have been good for the most part. Last week I stuck to my planned foods and then loosened the reins when I spent the weekend with my boyfriend. My weight went up yesterday morning unsurprisingly but I'm almost back down to where I was on Friday (127). This weekend should be even more manageable because I'm only spending Friday night/Saturday with my guy. I'm working on Sunday and I'll be too busy running around to even think about food.  </TEXT>

I binged REAL bad Sunday night but I've been pretty well since then and the scale is finally back down to where I was last week. I don't feel great about undoing some of the progress I've made but I'm relieved to feel like I'm back in control. I've upped my EC stack a bit and it's definitely helping with my appetite.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sorry to hear you've been struggling but I agree having days off is important, especially when you need it. I hate that I associate food with comfort, but it is nice to have something I can fall back on when I'm feeling low. 

I'm glad to hear you're feeling calmer and I hope that your new plan gives the support you need. I'm rooting for you. Cheers to a new start! </TEXT>
