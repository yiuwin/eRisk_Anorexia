Loot all the stuff of the racks and a lot of them are on the ground as well.

Many of these 'white' items will be intricate or ordinate. Rinse and repeat between a couple of camps.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WoW refugee here, enjoy this game immensely. More so than WoW...

Played Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim. This game is not exactly like them, it can't be due to being an MMO. In some cases it is much better, in some cases the single player TES games are better especially if you like modding and giving yourself godlike powers.

All in all, ESO grew on me and I would rather play it with my friends then fire up Skyrim and wander alone. Both are excellent games though, depends what you want / need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend, I think we are misunderstanding each other here.

I do not want Fedora to include any Virtualbox code at all. All I want to do is to be able to compile and install the drivers in Fedora.

In order to do that these packages are needed:

gcc kernel-devel kernel-headers dkms make bzip2 perl

They are all from the default Fedora opensource repo. With them the guest drivers can be compiled and Fedora will run as a well behaved guest operating system.

Getting those package installed when there is no network connection to the guest is a huge impairment. 

Including those packages will not defile Fedora with Dark Side proprietary code. They are from the official open repo.

My first line in my original post was:


It need not be the default image, but I think a lot of people use Fedora in Virtualbox (due to having to have multiple test environments).


I.E. It will be most appreciated if there was a GNOME desktop development Fedora spin optimised for virtualisation as a guest OS.

I am pretty sure plenty users run Fedora and CentOS and RH in VMs and not on the bare metal purely to ease testing and development. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> HyperV requires Windows 10 Professional, Virtualbox on the other hand don't. In my country the price difference between Windows 10 Pro and Home is about USD 126.00 when converted. Multiply that by 5 development machines for a small design company, and it adds up.

Quoting from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/hyper-v-requirements


Operating System Requirements


The Hyper-V role can be enabled on these versions of Windows 10:



Windows 10 Enterprise

Windows 10 Professional

Windows 10 Education


The Hyper-V role cannot be installed on:


Windows 10 Home

Windows 10 Mobile

Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise

Seeing as most clients runs Windows, having the LAMP stack on a Linux Virtualbox inside a Windows host makes testing a lot easier (yes some companies still only use Internet Explorer and won't install anything else).


Also Virtualbox is opensource and free, and it works really well. The issue is not Virtualbox, the issue is getting all the kernel development files and gcc installed without proper guest support.

	<TEXT> It need not be the default image, but I think a lot of people use Fedora in Virtualbox (due to having to have multiple test environments). 

And installing all the extras from the official repos just to get display, folder sharing and in some cases networking to work is an unnecessary step, especially seeing that Fedora desktop is marketed as the developers desktop.

	<TEXT> To quote Wikipedia: 'An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is a guided ballistic missile with a minimum range of 5,500 kilometres (3,400 mi)'

Why do these misiles have a minimum range? If they can be launched vertically up, they surely can be programmed to decent straight down again, unless the amount of fuel in them has to be so much that launching vertically would make them escape the earth's gravitational pull. But is this really why? </TEXT>

There have been a couple of posts recently with awesome screenshots of this amazing beautiful world we have the joy of experiencing.

It should be nice to have a thread dedicated to these screenshots. Please note that this thread is not meant to dictate that screenshots should be posted only here, this is Reddit after all, so the community will create the rules and tendencies , post wherever and however you like. Personally though I would really like a thread with multiple screenshots and stories about the screenshots to drool over :)

So, here is my screenshot. It is of my Nord Dragon Knight called Hrothgar Wulfheart and his trusty companion Romulus:

Today we don't rely on the canine teeth as much as a couple of thousand years ago (perhaps couple of hundred thousand).

But because evolution is very slow process especially when it comes to evolving away from a previous beneficial selection state, we still have the canines.

Should we continue to eat all these highly processed soft food we may still evolve our teeth away completely :)

EDIT: So the answer to your question is that we don't have them now as a necessary survival trait, but we use to depend on them in the past for defence and ripping meat off bones (like what WRSaunders said below). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a combination of the volume, surface area and density of bread.

Since bread has a very low density per volume, a lot of the microwaves hit the exposed surface area of the bread and due to its sponginess microwaves also travel through bread much more rapidly, than through for instance meat that is much more compact. 

So the area of 500 grams of bread that can be hit by microwaves is a lot larger than the area of 500 grams of steak for instance. </TEXT>

On PC you can bind a key to hide the HUD. I made mine the Backspace key because it was bound to nothing. 

So in game get the view you want and then press Backspace to hide the HUD (if that is the key you bound). With the HUD hidden you press print screen key.

	<TEXT> For all the greatness and awesome in game community this game have, the one thing that ZOS needs to address is how the group finder tool works.

I get it that max level characters do not want to run a *normal* dungeon with people below 50. Everybody wants a smooth quick run, and having to carry people may not be the best use of your time. However it is real douche bag invoking behaviour to just kick others as soon as the group formed.


There are multiple ways ZOS can fix this issue, some of these may be:

1. Level scale the Group Finder so that only people from level 10 - 49 will be grouped up and all level 50 toons will be only grouped with other level 50 toons. Yes it may take a bit longer to get into a group but at least you will not be insta-kicked and then sit with a 15 minute debuff.
2. Hide every ones level so that there is no way to see each other's level when grouped for a normal dungeon.
3. Make it work like WoW's system where it is not possible to vote kick anybody before the first boss in a dungeon was downed.
4. Make group finder unavailable until level 50. Extreme yes, but less infuriating than having to deal with multiple 15 minute debuffs every 50 minutes continuously because  some high level douche bags where selfish.


Apologies if this post came of as antagonistic, but the way the group finder tool currently functions is causing a very bad experience and image of the multiplayer aspect of this great game to new players. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aah excellent news. Yeah I read that the time between researches increases exponentially, hence the reason to try and find the correct traits to research first. Did not want to be left with 128 days of research on an OP trait :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not being antagonistic here but from this post I gather you will not find joy in this game that requires some input from a player's side in order to get stuff.

Maybe stick to the easy games where you get all your gear and skills handed on a silver platter or perhaps even bought in P2W games? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because if you don't tank or heal and only stay out of the red stuff on the floor with a block here and there, all dungeons available while leveling can be easily done as DPS, as ranged DPS it is a joke how easy it is.

BUT to tank or heal requires a deeper knowledge of the game and specific boss mechanics. So don't queue as tank or healer if you are new to the game (I know you didn't). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uhm, you give up so quickly after your very first ESO dungeon ever???

Having a competent tank and healer makes all normal dungeons easy as goblin pie.

Maybe the tank just needs to l2p how to tank. He is suppose to keep agro and not die. A lot of tanks skip the defensive skills for offensive skills and wonder why bosses are one shotting them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's say I want to prioritize the following traits to be researched first on my weapons:

* Sharpened
* Precise


And for armor pieces:

* Divines
* Reinforced
* Training


What would be the best method to obtain the required items to research from? Can other player's crafted items with this given trait be used? Will it always be 100% researchable? What determines whether I trait is researchable? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all


New to the game and have been reading up on sets and crafting.


How exactly do you craft all items from a given set?


All I understand thus far from what I read, is that you need to be at the specific forge out in the world where a certain set is forged.


But what then? What comes next? Do you need to have certain materials? Certain motifs? I tried to create items but I can't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a ping of about 280 - 350 ms. From South Africa and playing on the EU server. 

Weird thing though is that in WoW and SWTOR I have a ping of consistently 205 - 215 ms also playing on the EU servers. 

Not sure if the MegaServer technology is adding some additional latency to the game as data is send internally between the shards. 

Would like to know the latency of people in EU who also played WoW or SWTOR and now ESO.
