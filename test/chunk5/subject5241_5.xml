This is coming from the same people who don't wash their hands after touching gross shit, cough into their hands and don't wash them and yet still act like they're all knowing!!! I have a tube in my eye(tear duct) and my mother thinks I should move it... uhh no. My father took my saying know as it hurts to do that as "then if it hurts to move then clearly something's wrong" uh no. Fuck you. I know my body(and tube). I'm also 21, they seem to believe they can control my hair still(wtf? It's hair get over yourself).  </TEXT>

I know I'm not because I understand death, and I know what to expect and that it's natural. I know I don't because I've experienced death before.

My question, how do I go to the funeral as support to my family? Even if I'm not mourning whatsoever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. Even if they kept it about the same. Royal rumble could be with the big pillars and stuff but different every time. Wrestle mania different every time. Summerslam like the 2007 style or something. And the other one which I can't think of rn... survivor series? Idk </TEXT>
