	<TEXT> I also did a democratic greece game where mountaineer/infart divisions took down the entire axis with 55% war participation (coat of arms on repeat roleplay). Same strat (exclusively air and inf production) however this is slightly different as most of the axis troops were fighting elsewhere including soviets whereas in the france game I was fighting the entire main axis force with just infart and beat them before soviets even got involved and also beat the soviets after

note: **I did not even use anti tank guns in either of these campaigns** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just did a democratic france game where I beat the axis and soviets with just infantry and artillery and air force.

This should imo not be realistic at all for a "high medium" population country like france to do.

I strongly feel that tanks should be a required inclusion in a 1940s and onwards army if you are going up against countries like the axis and the soviets.

Then I thought maybe this is the reason why the axis are weak in this game? maybe their tanks are keeping them down because tanks are so under tuned in the game?

what are your thoughts? </TEXT>

saudi arabia blocked sweden from speaking to arab league http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-saudi-idUSKBN0M50ZS20150309

this was the speech 

http://www.regeringen.se/tal/2015/03/utrikesminister-margot-wallstroms-planerade-tal-vid-arabforbundets-utrikesministermote/

Yesterday was International Women's Day. This is a day to celebrate womens achievements, recognise challenges, and focus attention on womens rights, womens representation and their adequate resources. Our experience is that womens rights do not only benefit women, but society as a whole.

More than 20 years ago, in 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development met here in Cairo to discuss various issues, including education of women and protection of women from all forms of violence, including female genital mutilation and sexual harassment. Many of these issues are still very much in play today and I urge you to contribute to upholding the agreements made here in Cairo 20 years ago. </TEXT>

I mean that for every generation turkey, like russia, has to struggle against an anti-democratic tendency, just as sweden has to struggle against a xenophobic tendency or america against a militarist tendency, to different degrees of success. In this sense they have an electorate that gravitates in a particular direction. I doesn't have to mean that the majority in each country supports that side, but I mean that that side naturally gains supporters in every new generation despite the best efforts of schooling/education and media </TEXT>

Just as america has a militarist electorate, turkey and russia have anti-democratic electorates and Sweden has a xenophobic electorate (and rightly so imo, being swedish myself)

Sure there are americans (on the coasts and in cities) who want less military spending and fewer wars, but the main drive of the american electorate will never scale down military spending or change the nature of US foreign policy. </TEXT>

Hitler came to power because the german public wanted him to. This whole "he mislead the german people" thing is just bs meant to prevent ill will towards germany after the war and promote lasting peace and prevent another round of versailles syndrome revanchism.

	<TEXT> makes sense for gdp, doesn't really make sense for gdp per capita though

given that refugees do not work for about a decade after arriving to the country it makes sense that they would lower gdp/capita. without the refugee crisis I think sweden would have had the same or slightly lower gdp compared to this number but even higher gdp per capita 

of course in terms of real wealth for average swedes there'd probably be no difference at all </TEXT>
