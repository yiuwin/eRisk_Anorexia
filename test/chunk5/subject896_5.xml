	<TEXT> I didn't like the original Daario, but that was fine because I didn't care for the book Daario. I think the audience will like the new guy more. He seems likable, unthreatening and charming but that's not necessarily who the character is supposed to be. To me, Daario can't be trusted and he's a bit sleazy. Ed Skrein (Daario 1.0) portrayed that pretty well. I think D D want Dany's relationship to bloom with him and Michiel Huisman (Daario 2.0) is a better romantic fit. I don't think the audience would have warmed up to Ed the way they will for Michiel.  </TEXT>

Dr. Robert Smith has terrible "bedside manner" and while he's good, he's not very warm. Dr. Clara Henry is a hack. This is the reason Dr. Harrington is so booked, the other two in town aren't very good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks great! I did this a couple years ago and the most disappointing thing is the next day when the pumpkin starts to wilt. Mike's arm folds down, Tom and Crow shrivel to almost nothing... May I recommend tossing a few packs of silica gel into your pumpkin? It's supposed to help prevent the shriveling.  </TEXT>
