	<TEXT> I have this feeling that even though BTC may drop in the short term, It is the main channel of how USD funds are going into crypto. Unless of course exchanges make USD ETH more mainstream. For that reason it has value. And acceptance at brick and mortar business by far outweigh altcoins. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> In the case of a Bitcoin Hard Fork </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Let's say Bitcoin goes through a hard fork and the coin splits into two different coins. Normally (in the case of ethereum) everyone who owned ethereum received ETC essentially free of charge, right?

In the case of BTC, to receive these forked coins would you need to have your coins on the current exchange when the coins are listed. What if you have your coins in a paper-wallet, or on a hardware device. Would you receive the other coins. Would there be a difference between where your coins are stored? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I got my Accounting and Finance Degree and in the process not only realized the pay would be less than you'd want for working 10 hrs a day (essentially as a slave for the first years to even get to the CPA test) but the greed and unethical nature of corporate finance is not something I believe I'd agree with if I entered the industry.

Still then I don't regret the education. Education is key. </TEXT>
