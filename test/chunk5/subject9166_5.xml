	<TEXT> I would give the movie an 8 out of 10. 
Things I loved (in no order):
Cinematography
Soundtrack
Special Effects
The whole cyberpunk feel was strong

I was very excited at the start to see Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott's names in the credits. And felt happy about the 2 hour length, but towards the later part I felt it was a bit stretched. 

My favourite scene has to be Roy's death and the short speech before, as he lets go the dove. The actor who played Roy did an A+ job. I was confused by his actions in the climax up till that point, but it was handled excellently. I was happy with the ending too. 

Immediately after watching I wiki'd it and read some reddit threads where a lot of people who've  watched it now say they were let down. I feel the sentiments are justified, and I guess I feel the same to a small extent. I expected to end the movie just dumbfounded.  
This was mainly because too much hype first of all, and then because a work like Blade Runner inspires the works that come after it. And if you've seen those works first, which have taken elements from the original, embellished and evolved and polished it, then of course when you watch the original you might feel a bit let down. I recognised several elements from Blade Runner that Ive seen in other works like it. 

The same happened with me when I watched Citizen Kane. Even though the movie is objectively brilliant and dumbfounding if you compare it with works of its time, it has faded a bit if you see it now simply because we've seen bigger and better.

But yeah as far as Blade Runner goes, 8/10. Also I read that the original one had a noir-ish voiceover? Da fuq. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just commented on another 'favourite scenes' thread about this scene and how I never see anyone talking about it. Glad to be proven wrong. It's probably my favourite non-action scene in the movie. It's just really inspirational and it motivates Peter who then tries to be Spider-Man again and falls flat on his back lmao. Just excellent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gonna go with the two that come to my mind the first. Maybe not the best even in my opinion but fuck, they're really good and I love them. 

First, the subway showdown in The Matrix. When Neo looks at Agent Smith and then at the exit as the music crescendos, and then chooses to fight as Trinity, Morpheus and Tank look on in disbelief. Gets me so pumped up I could break a bastard. 

Second, I'm sort of influenced from the post about Spider-Man 2 holding up so well. It's the scene from SM2 when muggle Peter goes around to Aunt May's and she's packing her shit with the neighbouring kid. Peter apologises for their last encounter and she forgives him, then she goes on to give a really beautiful speech on heroes, their importance to the people around them, and how they're an inspiration. That whole scene is really beautifully directed and the acting is just excellent. I never see people talking about it though, so here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice theory, likeable, but I think that if the Blackfyre rebellion was such a big thing thematically, then it would've been a bit more stressed on in the main story. I mean as of now it has only been mentioned in passing. And not nearly enough ASOIAF readers have read Dunk and Egg.
So I dont think its gonna go down like that.
As far as the whole "unJon will lead the WW army" theory, I disagree with that too. Jon hasn't got a single reason for doing so, yet. And I think all the future actions of characters will be based on their motivations and actions until now, the end of Dance. I highly doubt suddenly Jon's gonna see a WW baby playing on the street and get motivation to lead their army, you know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /r/EDMproduction checking in.

Imo the answer lies in the issues of production itself, specifically the loudness wars.

When it comes to electronic genres and subgenres people usually try to get their shit as loud as possible, something that isn't a big priority in Hip Hop.

To get that loud you need headroom. What eats the most headroom? Bass frequencies. Even with multiband compression, you will need to sacrifice your bass to get your average levels up there even close to the pros. 
So you end up with a loud banger but it lacks that fat hip hop bass. I'm not sure but also in Hip Hop you have lesser elements in the chorus etc so I guess you can give the bass the space it needs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude I'm a hindu from UP with zero links to Kashmir. But it takes no Einstein to see that a large part of anti-Indian sentiments in Kashmir are caused by the mishandling of the situation by the military, the intelligence and the government. What Kashmir needs now is great measures for integration. 
We need to convert these people from Kashmiris to Indians. And shooting those who pelted stones is not the way to do that. That's an incredibly rash knee-jerk decision. 

Fine, you kill one dude who pelted stones. Great, you've taught them all a lesson. To his kids you've taught an even better lesson, that evil Indians took their father/mother away from them. Some 'Indians' they'll end up being. </TEXT>

The shit ya'll are suggesting is what's caused the situation to degrade so much. Jo pro-India hain unko bhi anti kar do unke dosto/family walo pe goli chala ke...

EDIT: the mistake people are making is that you're not even trying to empathise. No one is born anti-India or something. We need to understand why these people think that insurgency is an answer when it's obviously (to us) not. And we need to strike the issue at that point, whatever it may be. Those people pelting stones are just people like you and me and we need to keep that in mind. </TEXT>

This single track makes me the most pissed off when the drop hits. It's so uplifting and amazing; the lyrics get you in the mood, the chords are excellent, it's just so perfect and the buildup happens and youre ready to cum then you get this shitty af drop. What a waste.

And there are a LOT of electro house tracks that fit this strange shitty drop mould. Almost all of Big Room. But then it's what you'd expect from Big Room, so. Still, sad to see a potentially great track ruined by a shitty drop. Another track I'm trying to remix to get rid of the shitty drop is Helicopter by Garrix/Firebeatz. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a very complicated thing. Definitely no clear cut right course of action. If your friends values chastity so much I guess he can have his divorce. Is his wife a nice person? A big part of me feels like he needs to tell her that he knows and really communicate with her, find out why she lied and what her take is, if she hid it out of regret, shame, or what. A user somewhere in here suggested counselling, and I think that might be a very feasable route. Maybe he should go to counselling with her, using a different pretext, break the truth to her in FRONT of the counsellor so he has a witness in case she tries to railroad him, and hopefully talk it out. 
Of course if he's dead set, he should get a divorce. Lekin yaad rakhna, shayad utni hot ladki phir KABHI na mile. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, man. Look Ive been where you are, in a very similar place. 92 percent in 10th and failed 11th grade. But you know what, Im glad those things happened, seriously. I've met some of the most amazing people I couldve met taking the paths that I ended up taking.

As for the things you can do, dont worry okay. You wont have bragging rights as far as college is concerned but you can have an amazing future, and thats what matters. You can give the entrance exams to colleges which take their own tests which are usually pretty easy, if youre above the average joe (not in ratta-fication ok.)

I was at a seminar yesterday and 2 of the best, most accomplished speakers there told the students that nobody gives a shit about marks. One of them had a 52 percent score in 12th and the other failed in his college (then university of Roorkee, now IIT R) 14 times. 
So chin up, friend. And have hope. Choose someplace you can get in and just start doing some course you like. 

Half of your issue is loneliness. The gap year does that to people. Once you get back into the college routine, everything will be better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, dude.
Our lives arent getting any better by having Kashmir. But their lives do have a chance. With India they have a good future. Alone, it wont be 5 years before Pak steps in and makes a smaller Pakistan.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are Canadian or American or something, right? 
I've lately observed that the opinions most far from the mark and out of touch w/ the ground realities are from the ones who are completely detached from the situation.
Only the NRI Sikhs spouting weird stuff about Indian occupied Punjab, only the non-residents saying how India "marched into Kashmir with guns" (if you read a bit of history, youll know that THAT particular role was fulfilled by Pak first.)

The voter turnout for the Kashmir elections said enough in my opinion. If a majority of Kashmiris wanted independence and were being "occupied" they wouldnt have come out en masse to vote in their occupier's elections. </TEXT>

And DON'T stop producing. I'm also fairly confident that if you use reference tracks and learn the difference between your perception and what's considered alright, with some experience you'll come over that!
Stay positive, peace. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In one of your comments you mentioned The Killers, and I'll agree, they're an American's American band. Just zero relatable-ness there.

But I'd say that a majority of the songs which have meaningful lyrical content can be relatable once you try a bit to transpose them on yourself.

But what do I know, I like electronic music and that shit's relatable internationally.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It was a disaster. No one would accept theprogram. Entire crops were lost.

Okay, what I understand by that is that the machines created the first version, plugged people into it/brought it online or whatever and it ran for some time. It was a world wherever everyone was happy and no one suffered, the "ideal" world as the machines thought we'd like. But in that matrix, people's minds began to reject it because they all felt 'off', like Neo does in The Matrix. So eventually the entire reality crashed and bam, all the people connected to it died.  </TEXT>

P.S: Writing a book is a very long, boring process so if you want quick money this is NOT the way to go. It's long, boring and you will probably give up before the halfway point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isnt shitty like /u/gordon_ramasamy said. The thing is, this is not a plot at all. It's the idea you're starting with.

What you have here is an arc for your character. This is how the protagonist/love interest's personalities began and here's how they changed at the end.
Your job now is to figure out a decent plot to enable this arc, to make it happen.
So brainstorm, my man. Definitely better than Chetan fucking Bhagat, for sure. You could have something.

Political marriage, check.

Love story, check. (and there WAS a love story, records say.)

Different religions, check. (except here the queen worships the old gods, chronologically speaking)

Giant kingdom, check. (Akbar's kingdom stretched from Afghanistan from where his grandfather Babur who started the dynasty hailed to the majority of India and everything in between; just like the North, which is huge.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on how much work you put in. You improve a little with each track you make. Put a shitload of work in, and you get quick results. The 10,000 hour rule (not literally 10k hours,  just a fuckload of time ok it's a metaphor) applies in every creative field. Now it might take you super long to reach that threshold because you leveled up slowly, putting work in at a steady pace, or it might take you super quick, because you turned into a track factory improving every day.

To answer your question though, I think Im at 2.5 years or so and I can finally make sounds I like. Ironically, the tables have turned. At the start I churned out finished tracks w/ shitty mixes/sound design. Now that my sound design/mixes have improved, finishing songs is proving to be a big deal :/
Also sounding pro still feels far off </TEXT>
