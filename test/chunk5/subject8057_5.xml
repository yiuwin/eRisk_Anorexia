	<TEXT> Okay. If you think I'm wrong, why don't you go show me the place on the FDA website (or in other FDA materials) which shows where marijuana is indicated for the treatment of chronic pain?

Drugs have to go through an approval process to be approved for the treatment of various conditions in humans.

Last I checked, marijuana has not done so for any condition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is that you're buying into a lie there. The outrage wasn't over a review; that was a dumb internet rumor which of course the SJWs claimed was the whole thing, even though said rumor didn't even come along until after the initial burst of outrage.

The outrage was primarily focused on positive press coverage she'd received from someone she was cheating on her boyfriend with around the time the article in question was written (said journalist's employer looked into the timing and couldn't conclude that the relationship started before the article was written), as well as the fact that she apparently slept with her boss (who was himself cheating on his wife) - which itself is a huge problem, because of power dichotomies in the workplace. A boss can take advantage of their employees by more or less forcing relationships on them, which leads to huge problems. The opposite can also be an issue, where an employee tries to bribe their way to a promotion with sex, not only because it puts other employees into the aforementioned abusive situation, but also because it can normalize the sort of abusive situation that can happen. Relationships between employees and employers thus are pretty much always potentially squicky for this very reason, and the fact that he apparently slept with her during the hiring process just makes it that much worse.

Ironically, this is one of the very things that the social justice movement (which she belongs to) pushes against, because it is shitty and leads to shitty, awful situations and can promote misogyny and abuse of women in the workplace (as women are the primary victims of this shit).

And really, all good people should be opposed to shit like that, because it really *is* fucking awful. People using power dichotomies in the workplace to extract sexual favors from people is not okay, and actions and behavior which normalize such behavior isn't okay. While the appearance of impropriety is not impropriety itself, it can be difficult for an outsider to differentiate between the two. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're wrong and you are partially responsible for getting Donald Trump elected for believing it. Congratulations!

The alt-right existed long before the whole Gamergate thing and was totally unrelated to it; it only ended up lumping on later on.

The actual situation was this:

1) Gamers have long been unhappy with the gaming press being incestuous and often susceptible to outright bribery. This has been an issue since the 1990s. Anyone with any real knowledge of gaming history would be aware of this fact. Gamers are a racuous bunch and are constantly suspicious of companies influencing review scores, which isn't helped by the fact that ads for video games support gaming journalists, and gaming journalists often get nice stuff from gaming companies and sometimes get wined and dined and taken out to big press events which are meant to impress people and get them positive press.

2) There are also issues of nepotism within the gaming press and indie game developers, with people using their friends and relationships to promote themselves. This is actually a big problem as well, something a lot of people don't want to talk about; bosses trying to solicit employees for sex is a thing that sometimes happens. Relationships between bosses and employees can be abusive, can be abused from either end (an employee getting in a relationship with a boss to get promoted, a boss forcing a relationship on an employee as a condition of employment/promotion/other consideration).

3) A lot of gamers are pretty apolitical, or at the very least don't want politics in their gaming crap (they come to gaming to *escape* that stuff), so seeing people trying to push political stuff in gaming journalism sites upset them. Any political stuff which doesn't have anything directly to do with gaming (i.e. net neutrality, attempts at regulating gaming) are likely to upset people because they didn't sign up for that shit.

4) A lot of gamers are hypersensitive to being bullied, having been bullied themselves.

5) Gamers have often been a punchingbag for assholes and blamed for all sorts of social ills which are totally unrelated to them. Jack Thompson is an obvious conservative example of this, and the modern leftist versions who blame games for rape are no more welcome than the right-wing version which blamed games for school shootings.

Once you understand this backdrop, the way the whole Zoe Quinn debacle slots into it is pretty obvious - someone who has sex with gaming journalists and their boss, who used her connections in the gaming press to get positive press for herself, who is blatantly and unwelcomely political, and who has ties to people who claim that video games are to blame for various social ills, is pretty much exactly who you'd expect to piss a lot of people off.

So what happened? Gamers got pissed and flipped their shit, because that's what gamers always do.

Now, the SJWs - Zoe Quinn's bunch - claim anyone who opposes them is obviously a racist, or sexist, or whatever the hell else because they're vile people and they try to defend themselves by claiming anyone who points out any bad thing that they did is a bigot and therefore their claims totally don't count. They then got their buddies to join in on this.

This, however, attracted the natural enemies of the SJWs, the alt-right, who are really the opposite side of the coin - they're also horrible, vile assholes who are pretty much a mirror image of the SJWs. The alt-right thus jumped onto the bandwagon, and because a lot of the mainstream media was reluctant to interview RandomGamer420, was more willing to give them a voice, as well as because, well, frankly, they fucking hate SJWs and will attack them at every opportunity.

It also let them seem reasonable to a lot of people, because this was something they were intimately aware of, and the mainstream media was doing a shitty job of presenting it - but these guys were willing to tell *the truth!* And so the credibility of rags like Breitbart went up and people's evaluation of the truthfulness of the mainstream media went down.

All according to plan.

This of course also caused the SJWs to jab their fingers out and say this totally proved their point about how all their enemies were secretly horrible bigoted racist sexist blah blah blah, of course completely ignoring the fact that, no, a lot of the people who were opposed to them weren't from that group.

But, of course, if you were stupid and knew nothing about the subject matter, seeing the alt-right shouting about this shit of course must mean everyone involved must be a part of the alt-right, right?

Some idiots are willing to vote for Donald Trump to try and keep people like that out of power.

And so, because people believe stupid shit about this, some people were more likely to vote for Donald Trump. Given his razor-thin margin of victory, it is entirely possible that a few hundred thousand people who were disgruntled over that stupidity decided the election, either by voting for Donald Trump or simply by not voting at all.

The whole Gamergate thing was fucking retarded, but the idea that everyone who was criticizing the gaming press was a member of the alt right was obviously wrong and completely idiotic. I knew some people who were part of that whole debacle (I was peripherally involved - I went to the Wikipedia article because I figured that the gamers would be defacing it en masse, and they'd probably need people to fix the article, and instead found the SJWs doing so instead, eventually culminating in them doxxing me - along with a transgendered teenager) and frankly, most of them were liberals. Indeed, polls suggested as much.

This kind of flies in the face of the idea that they're a lot of alt-righters, and indeed, they weren't. The alt-right shouted about it, but few of the people intimately involved with the whole thing were members of the alt-right, especially originally.

But you believe it because you lack any actual knowledge of the subject matter, which is precisely how assholes like SJWs and the alt-right operate - they claim that everyone who opposes them is a member of group X with motivation Y.

This is pretty much their MO.

The thing is, it really ultimately had almost jack-all to do at all with feminism, and the fact that Zoe Quinn was female was frankly irrelevant to what most of the people were actually butthurt about.

The real irony is that the person who originated the whole thing - Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend - was himself a member of the social justice community, and his original blog post ranting about Zoe Quinn was basically about how Zoe Quinn was a total traitor to the movement, did not practice what she preached, and was totally in violation of the principles of social justice. His blog post was about how he had been wronged, and about how Zoe Quinn had effectively raped him (because, to some segments of the social justice community, cheating on someone = rape because you're having sex with someone who had sex with someone else without your knowledge, thereby exposing you to STDs against your consent, which means that the sex isn't really consensual, which means it is rape).

EDIT: I forgot the bullying thing, but part of the reason why there was a blow-up over Zoe Quinn was because a lot of people already hated her.

About a year before the whole Gamergate debacle, Zoe Quinn claimed to have been harassed by a bunch of people on Wizardchan (which is basically a place where a bunch of depressed NEETs go). Some publications took her at her word and published her allegations that she'd been harassed by those people, resulting in a bunch of people going to harass people on Wizardchan... but as it turns out, no one had ever bothered to fact check it. Ultimately The Escapist ended up editing their original article and issuing an apology right around the time of the whole Gamergate debacle.

A lot of people had seen it as an attempt to promote herself and give herself greater visibility at the expense of a random community of depressed nobodies on the Internet, which had primed a lot of people to hate Zoe Quinn before the whole Five Guys thing happened that kicked off Gamergate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The total number of jobs has gone up, though, if you count males and females. There's more people working today than at any other point in history. So obviously it isn't limited in this way.

One of the causes for this is education - more people are going to college, including older people, and more people are pursuing advanced degrees.

Moreover, having prime working-age females in the workforce means that there's more opportunity for males to not work and still be supported. In other words, greater opportunity for slacking (or more optimistically, being house husbands - though not so much of the latter).

Incarceration rates have also climbed, which results in fewer males working, and disability rates have also gone up.

The article itself seems to suggest that social programs have financed it - over half of these unworking people appear to live in households which are collecting some form of disability benefit, and their standard of living has been going up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was referring to the letterboxed views, and indeed, explained why the other views are cropped further down in my post. You clearly did not read it in its entirety.

The 21:9 you're showing isn't letterboxed. Unless you fuck up the screen image, without letterboxing, you have to do what they did.

You don't want to give some people a wider horizontal FOV and some people a higher vertical FOV - a wider horizontal FOV is generally advantageous in a game like Overwatch, so it makes sense that they didn't allow it. The 21:9 that isn't letterboxed has a narrower vertical field to avoid giving them an advantage, and the only way for them to give you the same horizontal FOV as a 16:9 is to reduce your vertical FOV.

[It was explained why it was done this way months ago.](http://www.pcgamer.com/overwatchs-new-219-support-actually-reduces-field-of-view/)

Basic competitive design principles here.

Giving everyone the exact same maximum FOV dimensions is logical. Allowing people to go down from those is fine, but you don't want people to be able to go up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doctors are supposed to avoid prescribing opioids to people with a history of addiction and use disorders, but doctors fuck up. That's how it goes. It doesn't help that a lot of people hide the fact that they have a history of use disorders or that they might have a predisposition towards them.

Moreover, that's an argument for banning alcohol, gambling, cigarettes, and literally everything else.

Opioids are useful and helpful to many people. I've taken them before after dental surgery. Not a big deal.

 Mental Illness, drug addiciton, etc. are often precursors to homelessness is a much better way of understanding the high rate of mental illness and drug addiction of the homeless rather than "the issue is that the homeless just really love drugs and being mentally ill" to use a metaphor.

Drug abuse is a choice. It is also a disease. There's a reason why the #1 way that people quit using drugs is simply stopping using drugs.

Drug abuse is also predictive of poor decision making, which obviously predisposes you towards homelessness as well. This isn't really surprising if you think about it - poor impulse control is associated with both poverty and drug abuse, and poverty obviously can cause homelessness. Poor impulse control can also directly cause homelessness, if it results in people not wanting to rent to you/kicking you out.

Mental illness is not a choice, but how people react to it is a choice to some extent. The mentally ill are not subhuman; they still have free will, they just are messed up. Mental illness is an explanation, not an excuse.

Most mentally ill people never become homeless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The prescription opioid epidemic was started when Purdue Pharmaceuticals advertised Oxy to docs with the explicit claim that it was not addictive. Doctors then prescribed it to chronic pain patients; normal people who may have never touched illegal drugs in their lives. They take it because it stops the pain, and stopping the pain feels good. Eventually, it stops working, and they have to increase their dosages. Eventually, they become addicted. Not all people taking Oxy or Vicodin (also marketed as non addictive) become addicted, but a number of them do. Not all of the opiate addicts out there started with prescriptions, but a significant number did.

The problem with this story is that it doesn't appear to be true. [Studies have been done on this,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489635) and they show a very low level of abuse amongst people who use these drugs - even for long-term pain management - who don't have a prior history of use disorders.

The problem is that "My uncle Bob got addicted to pain meds because of mean old Big Pharma" is a much nicer story than "My uncle Bob, who frequently abused drugs, abused oxycontin too." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I smirked beneath my armor, behind my breathing apparatus. It was common for people to come up after the lecture was over to ask me questions, but they almost never asked about the very end. I guess they mostly didn't really think about it; if people were dead, they were dead. Why ask what happened in their dying moments?

"That's two questions," I said, stalling for time as the others left the room, leaving me behind with the short alien.

The creature scowled at me. Or at least, I'm pretty sure it was a scowl; I'd gotten a lot of practice in all the years that followed my escape from Earth, but every time I ran into a new species, I had to learn their expressions all over again. Still, these were, at least, humanoid, no matter the fact that they had facial tentacles on their cheeks. "Fine, then. How did the humans really die? You said it was a plague, but that's obviously a lie; your species was far too advanced to die to disease."

"Millions died every year from disease," I said, reaching up to the side of my helmet to click off the microphone, so that I was only speaking locally instead of broadcasting my voice across the empty auditorium. "But you're not wrong. It wasn't a normal disease. It was something nasty. In the end, we developed the technology necessary to make custom-made bioweapons. We could make a cure for anything, given time. But something bad enough, that spread fast enough?" I lifted a gauntleted hand to snap my fingers.

"Why would anyone do such a thing?" My questioner wiggled their facial tentacles in distress.

"Humans were bastards. They raped, plundered, pillaged, and killed all the time. We had food rot in storage while people starved in warzones. Hell, we *had* warzones; you people haven't had a war in centuries. Even when they weren't killing each other, people were stealing and being jerks and arguing and fighting."

"You don't sound like you liked your own species very much."

I sighed under my mask. "I didn't, kid. I mean, some of them were nice enough, but..."

The alien's facial tentacles squirmed as if trying to get off of its face, but the alien's big eyes never left me. "What happened?"

"Everything went to hell in a handbasket - that means bad. A lot of people died." My armored boots clicked against the tile floor as we moved off the carpet and into the halls leading towards the launch area. "I didn't have any friends left by the end of it all."

The alien stared down at my feet as I strode down the hall. "You said that someone made a horrible disease to kill everyone. You said there wasn't a cure." It lifted its eyes to look up at me. "Why didn't you die?"

"Well, technically, I said that there wasn't enough time for them to find one. There *was* a cure, they just didn't make it in time. I did, though."

"So you figured it out, but everyone else was already dead? That's horrible!"

"Hey, I never said I figured it out *after* everyone else died. Fact is, I made the cure before the first person even got sick."

The alien stopped in the hall, staring. "Why didn't you share it?"

I stopped and turned around, my grin hidden by my helmet. "Well, that'd kind of defeat the point of making the bug in the first place, wouldn't it?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Heroin is not a prescription opioid; it is an illegal drug. There is no approved medical use for heroin in the United States. Just because heroin is an opioid doesn't make it the same as codeine.

2) People illegally diverting opioids to addicts is an issue, but this doesn't mean that opioids should be banned.

3) The reason heroin addicts often start out misusing prescription opioids is because it is easier for an ordinary person to get ahold of prescription opioids than heroin. It is the same reason why marijuana is the "gateway drug". In fact, it is the very same argument used as for marijuana. People who are prone to substance abuse are most likely to start out abusing substances which are easy for them to get ahold of, and black market opioids and marijuana are two examples of such.

The idea that drug use primes people for use of other drugs is known as the [gateway drug theory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_drug_theory)

It tells you nothing about the reality of the situation. And indeed, [if you look at the historical data,](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/relationship-between-prescription-drug-heroin-abuse/prescription-opioid-use-risk-factor-heroin-use) you can see that it has changed over time with the availability of opioids - back in the 1960s, most people who abused heroin started out with it.

And indeed, if you look at the data, you can see that there has been a recent downturn in the abuse of prescription opioids as the first drug of abuse by heroin users. Indeed, this is *because* of a crackdown on the diversion of opioids into the black market, which has resulted in some people who were illegally abusing opioids to turn to heroin because prescription opioids had become more difficult to acquire illegally. People who start out illegally abusing opioids can often acquire them more easily than people who are long-term addicts, because doctors get wise to them. Meanwhile, as they turn to black markets for their drugs, other drugs become much more available, because they come into contact with the sort of people who can get them other drugs.

This is why you see heroin addicts claim that heroin is easier to get ahold of - because once you're that level of a junkie, doctors simply aren't going to give you opioids anymore.

Maybe you should educate yourself. I even linked to data showing that [people without a history of substance abuse are very unlikely to become opioid addicts, even if they use opioids for treatment of long-term pain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489635) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is entirely wrong. I'm sorry, but you've been lied to by Big Pot.

They are every bit as bad as Big Tobacco. Once you understand this, and understand that they are horrible people with an agenda who don't care about hurting people, you'll understand a lot more about what is really going on.

1) The "opioid epidemic" is not caused by prescription opioids per se. Rather, it is caused by drug addicts. Remember, opioids are inanimate objects; they can't really *do* anything.

2) IRL, prescription opioids are not very addictive. People who do not have a history of drug abuse who are prescribed opioids almost never become addicted. Indeed, even in studies of long-term prescription opioid use to deal with chronic pain, [only a tiny fraction of people without a previous history of substance abuse became addicted.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18489635)

3) Thus, what is actually going on is not "opioids are addicting lots of people", but "addicts like opioids".

4) Marijuana is itself pretty addictive; [about 30% of marijuana users have a use disorder.](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-addictive)

5) Marijuana is not approved as a drug because it has too many side effects. In order to be approved as a drug, you need to be better than existing drugs. Some cannabinoids (drugs which are derived from chemicals found in cannabis) are approved for the treatment of certain medical conditions, but marijuana itself is not.

6) The idea that marijuana is less problematic than opioids is simply false. The side effects of marijuana (getting high, anxiety) are generally worse than the effects of opioids, and its beneficial effects are smaller. Opioids like codeine are better at pain control than marijuana, and have far fewer side effects, and more powerful opioids are better at pain control.

The idea that marijuana is a medicine is one of those Big Lies. It is like calling tobacco or alcohol a medicine. They're not.

I'm in favor of legalization because I think that the social costs of banning it are higher than the social costs of legalizing it, and I'd rather we gain revenue from it, but let's not pretend like pot is good. It isn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You want everyone to have the same field of view. If you give people with a 4:3 aspect ratio the same screen height, the result will be a narrower field of view; if you do the same for someone with a 21:9 aspect ratio, they'll end up with a wider field of view.

If you fix width instead, then people with a 4:3 ratio would end up with a higher vertical FOV and people with a 21:9 aspect ratio would have a narrower vertical FOV.

The solution they implemented is to letterbox. You put everything at a 16:9 ratio, and you put black rectangles on the portions of the screen outside of that field of view. Thus, a 4:3 ratio will have black boxes on the top and bottom, to create a 16:9 FOV in the middle of the screen, while a 21:9 screen will have black rectangles on the far left and right of the screen, restricting the field to a central 16:9 ratio field.

You could make it so that no screen FOV is better than 16:9 by simply making all other screen resolutions worse, but this leads to the problem that people who want to play on a different aspect ratio monitor will be worse off. You don't want people's monitors' aspect ratio to give them a competitive advantage.

This isn't an issue for a single player game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And the visual data is so full of confounding factors to make it useless.

Actually, it isn't. The big five races can be visually identified with north of 99% accuracy. It isn't hard to do at all.

Identifying population groups more precisely than that is a lot harder. But you can tell that someone is Amerindian, East Asian, Indo-European, or sub-Saharan African with extremely high accuracy. People from the Indian subcontinent aren't terribly difficult to distinguish from Europeans, either, nor are Inuit difficult to distinguish from people of Mayan or Incan descent. The closer together ancestral population groups lived, the more difficult it is to distinguish them - while it is *possible* to visually distinguish between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people, it is much more difficult to do and people's success rates go way down, especially in the absence of cultural markers such as attire. Just like it is possible to sometimes distinguish between Italians and Norwegians, but you'll make mistakes a lot more often. The more gene flow happened between the groups, the less easy it is to distinguish between them.

 What do Creole, Nigerian, and Somali people have in common outside the skin colour and some bone shapes?

More recent common descent.

People in Africa interbred with adjacent groups, which resulted in considerable gene flow.

Same thing that happened with all other population groupings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The diagonal FOV IS the same on all monitors. The game displays a 16:9 field of view on these monitors. *All the monitors have the exact same field of view.*

The way it accomplishes this is via letterboxing.

I have a 16:10 monitor. What it does is create a small black rectangle on the top and bottom of the screen. This gives me exactly the same view as a 16:9 monitor, with wasted space (the black letterboxes) on the top and bottom.

Thus I see exactly the same thing as someone would see with a 16:9 monitor in the space between the black bars. In fact, it is pretty much exactly the same size and shape as my 1080p monitor (I have a 1200p monitor, so the display field is in fact a 1080p display field).

The same is true on 4:3 monitors. It creates those black boxes at the top and bottom, thereby reducing the fraction of the screen which is used, but the portion of the screen which is used is displayed at a 16:9 ratio. This gives them exactly the same field of view as someone using a 16:9 monitor.

On a 21:9 monitor, it instead puts the rectangles on the edges of the screen. This again restricts the field of view to a 16:9 ratio, giving you the exact same field of view as anyone else.

If you display the screen at full height on a 4:3 monitor, you'd be reducing the field of view of the player; this happens in some older games. To avoid this issue, they have it display in the way that it does.

Likewise, a 21:9 monitor would give a wider field of view for the same height, so they crop it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason why it has black bars on the top and bottom is to give it the same FOV.

That's why it works the way it does - it is meant to ensure that players don't gain an advantage by having a different monitor setup, and alternatively, that they don't have a *disadvantage* for it. 4:3 would give them a smaller FOV if they didn't do the letterboxing; instead they give them the full FOV with letterboxing. It is a bit smaller but it gives them a view equivalent to that on other monitors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Serious answer: shoddy forensics work and lack of evidence.

The problem was that the prosecution sort of threw together a hodge-podge of evidence. They presented "evidence of decomposition" in the trunk of the car, but the method they used was not proved to be scientifically reliable evidence for decomposition. There was supposedly duct tape on the skull, but the testimony relating to its position kept changing, and they couldn't be sure that it hadn't been on the outside of the bag and fallen in while they were doing the examination of the scene (lack of documentation, oi!). Some of the evidence was clearly a joke, like the "Win her over with chloroform" poster. Someone tried to do some forensics work on her computer and claimed she'd searched for "chloroform" 84 times, but then it turned out she'd only searched for it once, and the page she looked at was about its use in the 19th century. There were claims that the duct tape on the skull had a heart sticker on it, but there was no picture of such, and after chemical testing, there was no sign of the heart. The guy who found the body got paid $5,000 for it and apparently made statements about how it would make him "rich and famous".

Indeed, the expert who looked at the child's corpse could not determine the cause of death; the death certificate lists her COD as "death by undetermined means", with the homicide determination simply being a result of them being missing without being reported missing - a second coroner failed to return the same result because there was no actual physical evidence of homicide.

To win a conviction *in court*, you need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that something happened. But the evidence had a lot of flaws.

And that's basically what killed the case, in the end. The whole thing stunk, but to prove murder, you need to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, the following elements:

1) Unlawful.
2) killing.
3) through criminal act or omission.
4) of a human.
5) by another human.
6) with malice aforethought.

The prosecution, simply put, failed to meet that standard.

She was charged with:

 first degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and four counts of providing false information to police

The evidence they had was not enough to convict her on first degree murder, which also has the added element of premeditation, which the prosecution simply could not demonstrate.

She was convicted of providing false evidence to police, which there was clear evidence for. But there was simply not adequate evidence presented at the trial to rule that she committed first degree murder beyond reasonable doubt.

She ultimately was required to pay $217,000 for her lies, as she wasted a lot of police time, but... that was the extent of it.

As the jurors noted after the trial, the problem wasn't so much that they didn't think she was guilty as that the prosecution didn't prove it. Without said proof, there cannot be a conviction. Moreover, they weren't sure if she did it, or if someone else associated with it (such as her father) had done it, as, again, there wasn't enough evidence to differentiate. Without a clear cause of death, it was very hard to convict. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The visual component of race is linked to said population clustering. Given it is possible to identify people's race by looking at them, from their bones, and from their genes, obviously it is something with an empirical reality to it - "social constructs" aren't visible on bones. Indeed, the visual components of race are actually some of the genes which are most heavily selected for between population groups.

As I noted, whether or not race is relevant depends on the questions you're asking. The US government measures a lot of metrics and breaks them down on racial lines - income, crime rates, poverty, educational achievement, ect. Polling groups look at racial groups because people's race is predictive of voting patterns. The reason people do this is because race *does* correlate with some things, and knowing that is useful for making predictions in some cases, as well as looking for various issues which more heavily affect members of one race than another.

Racial categorizations aren't useful on an individual level because of individual variability, but from a broad macro standpoint, statistical trends can be useful for better understanding society. </TEXT>

PETA is a pretty nutty group and they say and do pretty outrageous things to get attention, not to mention have members who engage in illegal activites and former ecoterrorists who work as activists for them.

The idea that a lot of anti-PETA arguments are the result of paid shills is exactly the same mentality that Trump supporters have, and is equally delusional. Moreover, the idea that "PETA kills" is some publicity campaign is kind of bullshit; while it is something which is frequently noted, [it is an issue which is highlighted because it is true.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/05/pets-shelter-euthanization-rate_n_6612490.html) Hell, PETA [talks about its euthanasia work in its own PR releases.](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dog-and-cat-neglect-at-crisis-proportions-says-peta-group-spent-25-million-on-prevention-and-assistance-in-2014-alone-300028717.html)

While there are definitely organizations that oppose PETA for financial reasons, the reality is that people have hated PETA forever, and there are lots of good reasons to hate PETA. Moreover, just because a group opposes PETA and says bad things about it doesn't mean those bad things aren't true.

The best way to attack an unsavory group isn't to make up lies about them; it is to publicize the bad things they do. Why lie when the truth is bad enough? </TEXT>

Flip it around:

Trans people get very upset when other people misgender them or use the wrong pronouns or otherwise don't treat them as a member of the gender they identify with. Normal people don't really give a shit if you misgender them online; people get misgendered all the time online and 99% of the time, no one freaks out. I don't care if someone misgenders me because it doesn't matter and isn't a big deal.

But to a trans person, it *is* a big deal because they perceive it as an important part of their identity, and it upsets them when people tell them they're not "really" members of whatever gender.

People react badly towards trans people because of the whole uncanny valley effect, along with lingering homophobia and a sense of them being "perverts", as well as cultural reactions as the result of gendered private spaces (if you perceive a MtF transgendered person as male, and you're female, you may react negatively towards them being in the women's bathroom/locker room just like you would a man).

But even outside of such folks, there are many people who get annoyed by trans people simply because trans people try to tell other people how they're allowed to behave towards them - and indeed, how they're allowed to think of them. People do not like being told what to do.

Vegans are quite different. They are holier than thou, but it isn't insecurity, it is egoism. It is the same thing that drives holier-than-thou religious people. They want to look down their noses at other people, they want to be offended, they want to get in arguments and fights, and they want a reason to look down on other people. They see themselves as righteous and, therefore, whatever they do is justified. They also want to be special, and see veganism (or devoutness, or *insert thing here*) as a justification for why they are special.

While some people like this *are* insecure, most of them frankly are not. Rather, they're just assholes who are looking for some justification for hurting other people, emotionally or otherwise, and who use something as a justification for it, as well as a justification for why they are right and should have their way and everyone else is wrong and evil. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Studies of worker performance have failed to show higher wages causing persistent improvements in worker performance, though. Interestingly, there is some weak evidence that giving employees unexpected rewards (basically, saying you're going to pay them X amount, then paying them X + Y) yields better results than simply paying people more money, as they perceive the extra money as a gift and therefore feel sort of duty-bound to earn it.

Sadly, even performance-based incentives are often dubious; one study of CEOs back in the 1980s found that companies that gave their CEOs performance incentives and those which did not didn't see any difference in their average profitability.

	<TEXT> Simply giving raises isn't helpful unless you're getting something in return out of it - paying the same employee more money isn't going to change their performance significantly, but there are other reasons why you might choose to do so. The goal is to either hire better employees or to improve worker retention. Targeted raises of more productive employees may be more beneficial for the latter as well - while you aren't getting any more out of them, paying them more might make them less likely to go jump ship to someone else.

Other incentives (like performance-based bonuses) may directly boost performance, depending on the situation, but that depends on the employees. </TEXT>

It is also probable that productivity has been overestimated due to some flaws in how it is calculated, though I think that inflation is also overcalculated too. But that's neither here nor there, as that doesn't actually affect any sort of gap.

However, you do have to use the same inflationary index for both if you want to compare numbers. </TEXT>

If you include non-wage compensation (which you have to - that's part of the cost of employing someone) and use the same inflationary index to calculate both productivity increases and compensation growth, the two have been growing together.

Non-wage compensation has been growing at a faster rate than wage growth has, which makes wage growth appear artificially lower when in reality people are shifting wages into non-wage things (particularly employer provided insurance). </TEXT>

Moreover, how you spend your profits is likely to vary by your business maturity. A company that is growing (like Amazon) may have low "profits" but it is really just taking most of its profits and just reinvesting them into the company. A company that is already about as big as it is likely to get is more likely to return a higher amount of its profits to its investors because there isn't as much new stuff for it to invest in profitably. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is more genetic variation in Africa than elsewhere, but there's a lot of interbreeding between various adjacent groups within Africa as well.

The "big five" races are sort of groups of population groups which were somewhat restricted from interbreeding with each other by geographic barriers - the Sahara Desert, the mountains and deserts and jungles of Asia, the oceans, ect.

If you do genetic clustering, you find that if you set it to K = 5 (looking for five population groups), the five that will fall out are Indo-Europeans, East Asians, sub-Saharan Africans, Australonesians, and Amerindians. While people in India look a lot different from people in, say, Norway, there are continuous population groups stretching out between them which are constantly interbreeding with adjacent groups; as such, rather than seeing any sort of distinct barrier, you see a gradual cline, as skin tones and such change

The thing is, races aren't truly entirely discrete entities; obviously there is interbreeding. People do cross the Sahara (especially along the Nile, where the Nubians and Egyptians intermingled). South Asians cluster with the Indo-Europeans and the East Asians. The Australonesians have some East Asian influence. The Amerindians were descended from East Asians before being geographically isolated by the Pacific Ocean. Ect.

While it is true that race is a very gross top-level grouping, that's true of many things. Birds include flightless creatures like Kiwis, Ostriches, and Penguins. Mammals include bats, elephants, wolves, humans, and whales.

Just because categories are broad doesn't mean they don't correspond to some sort of physical reality. But they aren't always things which are absolute or don't have fuzzy edges.

It really depends on what you care about on whether or not a grouping is meaningful or not. Knowing that a whale is a mammal is useful for knowing some things about is physiology and evolution, but it tells you nothing about its general body shape or habitat. Bats and birds are not closely related, but they're both flying animals.

What categories matter depends a great deal on the circumstances and what the question you're trying to answer is. </TEXT>

TL; DR; humans are all a single species. Adjacent population groups of humans interbreed unless some barrier exists to prevent it. "Races" roughly correspond to five major geographical groupings of humans - sub-Saharan Africans, Indo-Europeans (who include everyone from North Africa and Europe to South Asia), East Asians, Australonesians, and Amerindians - which are separated from each other by major geographic barriers (the Sahara Desert, the mountains/deserts/jungles of Asia, Oceanic expanses in the case of Australonesians and Amerindians) which restrict interbreeding. However, there is mixture between these groupings along the edges - the Nubians and Egyptians mixed along the Nile River, the East Asians and Indo-Europeans mixed in South/Central Asia, the East Asians mixed with the Australonesians, ect.

The main argument from a biological standpoint is whether "intermediate groups" like the Egyptians are properly seen as "intermediate groups" or if they are simply part of a larger gradual population cline (basically, continuous variation within a population). It is about the relative level of distinction of groups, and how fuzzy the edges are - are they big areas of relative sameyness with thin areas of change along the edges, or are the edges thick and part of a more gradual transition between various gene clusters?

From a realistic standpoint, it is ultimately a problem akin to "when does a pile of sand become a heap?" or "When does a dwarf planet become a planet" or "When does a ball of gas become a star?" There's a difference between Jupiter and the Sun, but there's a lot of things in between which are not all that different from each other. Having separate categories for stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant is useful, but in the end there's some point at which you add just a bit more gas and it goes from a gas giant to a brown dwarf or a brown dwarf to a star.

This doesn't mean that categories are useless or don't have any meaning, but it does mean that they might have fuzzy edges and aren't absolute things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If you don't mind me asking, how accurate are genetic markers in predicting the race of a person?

It is accurate, *if* you use a sufficiently large number of genetic markers. The fewer markers you use, the less accurate it will be. It also depends on what you're comparing it to; you need a database of people from your population group to get any sort of idea. It also depends on some other factors as well; I'm a Euromutt, for instance, with ancestry from basically all of Northern and Western Europe, and even some Eastern Europe. Looking at my genetic markers, they'll tell you that I'm from everywhere from France and Ireland to Sweden and Poland. This is because I'm not really from a single population group. But it can tell you that I'm of European ancestry.

Here's one way of thinking about it: if you have two parents of, say, pure Norwegian ancestry, what are the odds of you ending up looking like someone from Zimbabwe?

Zero, right? That doesn't happen.

However, what are the odds of you looking like, say, a German or Italian?

Those odds there are much higher.

If you think about it, this isn't terribly surprising, given that physical anthropologists can identify people's race from their bones, and people can visually identify race by looking at people.

This is partially because some of the genes which vary between groups have very obvious outward phenotypic expression. Skin tone and hair color are two of the more obvious ones, while some other traits (like having pale eyes) are much more common in some populations than others.

But as you can imagine, it isn't so simple.

Races are simply population groups on a very macro level. Different population groups are related to varying extents. People in all places have variable skin tones, but their skin tones end up falling within a certain range, barring rare mutations like albinism. Italians have quite light to pretty tan skin, for instance, but they don't have like, really dark skin.

And as you go from the north end of Europe down to North Africa, you see gradually darkening skin tones. There's mixture between adjacent populations, resulting in gene flow between them.

This creates what is known as a ["cline"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cline_(biology)) - a continuous variation in some biological characteristic.

A lot of what defines the "big" races is discontinuities in such clines, generally because of geographic isolation.

When you look at the "big races", what you're really seeing are large groups of population groups which are generally separated from other groups of population groups by some sort of geographic barrier which greatly reduced the amount of interbreeding between population groups - Amerindians were separated by the ocean, as were the Australonesians. Africans were separated from Eurasians by the Sahara Desert. East Asians and Europeans were separated by the deserts and mountains of Central Asia, the jungles of South Asia, as well as sheer geographic distance.

The thing is, these groups are not 100% distinct - there is always some intermixing between population groups along the edges. If you look at [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Rosenberg_1048people_993markers.jpg), you can see some of that - there's some small amount of European ancestry in some African groups. The Indo-European groups in the Middle East have some African admixture. The Indo-European groups in Central and South Asia have some East Asian heritage (look at the Hazara and Uygur in particular), while the East Asians also have some Indo-European admixture. The Australonesians have some East Asian in them. Some of the Amerindian groups show obvious signs of their recent East Asian heritage. The more closely you look at people's genes, the more you can tell that at least some gene flow occurs a great deal of the time.

This is most obvious in North Africans - Egyptians, for instance, did a lot of historical commerce with Nubia to the South, and consequently there was gene flow across the Sahara Desert along the Nile. Likewise, on the other end of Africa, there was gene flow around coastline.

These sort of intermediate populations exist along the fringes between population groups.

As such, there are basically "groups", and then there are intermediate groups which sort of fall on the edges.

Or are there?

The argument in the field, as far as the actual science goes, is whether such "intermediate groups" are properly seen as such - basically as a mixture between two distinct population groups - or if they are better seen as part of a greater, more gradual cline between groups.

In other words, if you go south from Norway to South Africa, are you seeing a continuous, slow slope in genetic variation, as people gradually change as you go further and further south, or do you generally see a slow change, then a sudden much faster change as you hit an intermediate group, then a return to a much slower change at a new normal on the other side?

The thing is, a lot of the question of "race" is a sematic one. These genetic clusters certainly exist, and you can identify people visually as belonging to major groups and even sometimes more specific subgroups by looking at them, looking at their bones, or looking at their genes.

If you think about, say, [stellar classifications,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification) there a star at 6000K is either a yellow-white or a yellow star. Which is it?

It doesn't really matter, in the end - a star is a star. If a star is 5999K vs 6001K, it doesn't make much of a difference. But if a star is 5000K vs 7000K, that can be more significant.

It is useful for us to group stars by their stellar classes because they have some general attributes in common. When you start getting down to really low levels, down to the brown dwarves, there's a question of what constitutes a "star" at all - at what point does a gigantic ball of gas become a star? If a ball of gas can just barely fuse a tiny bit, then stops, is it a star, or not?

But there is a difference between, say, Jupiter and a small star, even though there are a bunch of things in-between.

Race, ultimately, doesn't matter much from an empirical point of view - individual characteristics vary immensely within each race. There are tall Asians and there are short Swedes. But it can be useful to talk about race from a sociological or biological standpoint - we can see that, say, people of a given race live longer or shorter on average, have different probabilities of various health problems, make different levels of income, ect.

In the end, race is basically a convenient grouping and a shorthand means of referring to a group of population groups. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Genetic markers are basically detectable points of genetic variation, which are found via various methods.

When we talk about population groups, what you see is [genetic clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_clustering) - basically, you look at a bunch of genetic markers (a large number of them), and then you look at variations with their distributions between groups.

Each population group has a different distribution of genetic markers within its population. Many genetic markers show up in *all* groups, but they don't show up at the same rate. Basically, in one group, you might have a 75% chance of having a marker, while in another group, you might have only a 25% chance of having said marker. Thus, said marker isn't a great indication that you are part of one population group or another.

However, if you take a large number of genetic markers, and look at their distribution, you can start to see patterns. If you look at, say, a hundred markers, then suddenly the randomness of the individual markers matters less. After all, you'll roll a 6 on a six-sided die 1/6th of the time, but the odds of rolling nothing but 6s on 100 die is very small indeed.

By looking at a probabilistic distribution of genetic markers, you can figure out whether or not groups "hang together" so to speak - they'll have more genetic markers in common with each other than other groups - if they are a genetically distinct population group, they'll have a distinct set of markers. If they're not, then they'll cluster in with other groups.

You can look at major, top-level population clusters or you can cut things down to a finer level by looking at smaller ones. [At K=5](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Rosenberg_1048people_993markers.jpg) (basically, splitting the world up into the five largest clusters), you see sub-Saharan Africans, Indo-Europeans, East Asians, Australonesians, and Amerindians. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Race has no consistent biological basis. Traits are linked to heritage and biology, yes, BUT the variation of those traits within race categories is often greater than the variation between categories.

This is completely untrue, actually.

*Genetic* variation is greater within groups than between groups. However, a lot of genetic variation is on "junk DNA", and moreover, this is misleading for reasons I'll go into below.

However, in terms of phenotypic traits, this isn't true at all - depending on the trait.

Some traits you see much more within-group variation than between-group variation - a good example of this would be height. If you look at people from various groups, you'll find immense variation in height. There is some inter-group variation (some groups *are* especially short or tall) but overall, you see tons of height variation and most groups fall well within the bell curve for each other.

However, other traits (such as skin color) show a lot more between-group variation than within-group variation - this is why it is very easy (generally speaking) to identify someone of a specific racial ancestry just by looking at them. Indeed, physical anthropologists can determine someone's race by looking at their bones pretty accurately.,

This would obviously be impossible if race was merely a social construct.

If you actually dig into the science of the subject, you'll find out that the idea that race is a social construct is, ironically, itself a social construct - it is an unscientific ideological push by certain people, as well as a deliberate miscasting of the science, covering an actual "real" argument over genetic clines and the importance thereof.

What you see within various population groups is distributions of genetic variations. But if you look at humans and *chimpanzees*, you can find a lot of genetic variations people share with *chimpanzees* that we don't share with other humans.

But clearly, there is a huge gulf between humans and chimpanzees!

The cause is threefold. First, non-coding (often referred to as "junk") DNA is not strongly selected for. Thus, variations within this aren't going to really matter, so the fact that they vary a lot is irrelevant - there's not really any selective pressure there, so there's going to be a lot of variation and gene drift. Secondly, there are things which don't have strong or have conflicting selective pressure on. The result of these is that you see them across a lot of population groups - stuff like blood types are a good example of this. While there is some weak selective pressure on blood types, you can find members of the major blood types within most population groups.

As a result, only a relatively small fraction of the genome is going to have strong selective pressure placed on it, and many of those are going to correspond to the most important expressed traits. And for these traits to reliably diverge, you generally need to have differential selective pressure placed on them - i.e. pressure coming from one direction for one group, and another direction for another. Skin color is a good example of this - there's a fairly strong bit of selective pressure for darker skin around the tropics and lighter skin around the poles. Thus, you see people in tropical areas who have darker skin and people around the poles who have lighter skin. Obviously this is not uniform, but it is a general trend you can see across population groups.

This is why skin color varies so much, incidentally - there's a relatively high level of selective pressure on it, and it is relatively easy to accumulate all of the "dark skinned" alleles, because skin color is not controlled by a single gene, but a large number of genes.

This means that any individual may have one or more alleles for "dark skin" or "light skin", even though they have the opposite color of skin.

If, however, you look at the group as a whole, and measure the prevalence of relevant genetic markers, you'll see a clear trend towards light-skinned groups having a lot of light-skinned alleles and dark-skinned groups having a lot of dark-skinned alleles.

And indeed, many human traits are like this - polygenic traits that are affected by more than one gene.

If you take lots of genetic markers, and look at them together, you find that you end up with [stuff like this.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Rosenberg_1048people_993markers.jpg) Rather than seeing random variation, you see clustering of variation.

While any individual genetic marker may not be particularly predictive of your population group of origin (your "race", if you will), when you look at the genome as a whole, you can determine someone's population of origin with quite a bit of accuracy, and you can look at populations and see how they are distinct from one another. You can also see that groups aren't "pure"; there is some admixture in all of them, and there are also clearly intermediate groups between population groups.

The main question is clinal in nature - basically, do we see large groups which have relatively similar genetic clustering patterns, then a thin band of hybrid groups, then another set of similar genetic clustering patterns, or do we see a slow, continuous change in genetic clustering patterns as you transition between one population group and another?

This is really where the main debate is within the science.

Population groups definitely exist and there are clear genetic differences between them - but if you look at just one genetic marker, you won't see that picture nearly so clearly. It is only when you look at them in total that you see this. </TEXT>

Or more accurately, race is *also* a social construct, but population groupings are a real thing and do indeed correlate with races (well, grossly - it is more complicated than this, because well, it's biology, of course it's complicated). If you look at large numbers of genetic markers, population groups corresponding with races are pretty obvious. The main argument is over the degree of genetic clines - i.e. how much hybridization and gene flow occurs/occurred between population groups. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Most of the people involved in the financial crisis committed no crimes. It is not illegal to be stupid or greedy, simply to commit fraud. Most people didn't commit fraud, which is extremely obvious from the evidence - that the people in question lost *vast* amounts of money when the housing market crashed. A lot of people bought into the belief that housing prices were going to go up forever, or at the very least for the foreseeable future, and thus, when the market downturn hit, they ended up losing their shirts. Why would people who were committing fraud be invested in the market they were committing fraud in?

2) The number of people who demonstrably fraud was pretty low. Remember, [there are over 8 million arrests in the United States each year.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43) A few thousand people would be a drop in the bucket - less than 1% of the total number of arrests each year, let alone crimes committed (as not everyone who commits a crime gets caught - indeed, even 40% of murderers get away with it).

It is immediately obvious that "but the financial crisis!" is not an answer to my objection about relative crime rates; not only were most people involved not committing any sort of crime, but the number of people who were was quite small relative to the total amount of crime in the US.

It should be remembered that a number of financial types did end up going to jail for other reasons around the time of the crisis. The reality was that proving that people had committed fraud was in many cases extremely difficult; remember, you need to prove *beyond reasonable doubt* that someone had committed fraud. Making a bad investment is *not* fraud, nor is overvaluing something. It is only fraud if you do so *purposefully*. And given a lot of them had lost a lot of money out of the whole thing, that's a pretty good defense against fraud.

Prosecutors tend to go after more clear cut cases of malfeasance. They don't go after cases they *might* win, they go after cases they *will* win, because they have limited resources. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bingo. This is a really important thing to understand - there's a different between right of access (which is a reasonable human right - the right to purchase goods and services) and the right to *have* said goods and services.

The idea of health care being a right is deeply flawed because it doesn't have any clear meaning. What is a "right to health care"? What does that constitute? How many resources?

Health care is a potentially endless resource hole. You don't have the right to enslave others and you don't have the right to the resources of others, ergo a "right to health care" is intrinsically flawed because it necessitates violating those basic human rights.

Any right which requires resources must be very narrowly constructed to avoid these issues.

That doesn't mean that governments shouldn't provide health care. But it isn't a human right in the same way that the right to free speech is.

There are some rights which do require the government to provide things - the right to an attorney when facing criminal prosecution is one example. However, such rights are generally sharply self-limiting. This is not an endless money hole because the government is not required to prosecute anyone - they can choose to not prosecute someone, and thereby, not spend the money. Moreover, they're not required to give you a huge legal team. This avoids the "taking other people's time/stuff" problem - rather than being an unlimited extrinsic right, it is something which drives up the cost of prosecuting the indigent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What is inflation?

Inflation is the measure of the increase in the price of goods from year to year. There is no such thing as a single inflation number; it is an estimate.

The problem is that the idea that incomes have only gone up by $3900/year since 1990 is an obvious lie, and is really a great indication of why the CPI (which is the metric in this case) is garbage.

So here's the deal: there are multiple inflationary indicies. CPI and IPD are two of the better known ones - the Consumer Price Index and the Implicit Price Deflator. They're calculated by different government agencies for different purposes; the IPD is the inflation adjustment used to calculate productivity increases, for instance.

The problem is that neither inflationary index is actually designed to measure long-term inflation. CPI, for instance, is calculated on a month to month basis; long-term inflation is simply "calculated" by multiplying together smaller changes and getting a bigger one.

The problem is you can't actually do this; it leads to wildly inaccurate results.

The reason is that inflation is calculated by taking a bundle of goods at one point in time, then taking that same bundle of goods at another point in time and calculating how much the price of that bundle of goods has changed. Obviously, your choice of goods in said bundle of goods affects the calculated inflation rate, as does your weighting of the prices of said goods.

The problem is that when you start looking at long periods of time, you come to the obvious and immediate realization that you cannot actually do this. While a bag of rice is a bag of rice, a car is not a car; a car from 1970 is not equivalent to a car from 1990, which is not equivalent to a car from 2017.

This is one of the ways in which things go completely wrong. The average price of a car has approximately doubled since 1990. But if you compare a 1990 car to a 2017 car, the 1990 car is vastly worse. If you look at the bottom level 2017 car, the cheapest one - the Nissan Versa - it is a vastly better car than the equivalent 1990 cars. Indeed, if you compare it to equivalent vehicles from 1990, you find that you simply cannot get a vehicle with a lot of its features from 1990 because they didn't *exist* yet.

The 1991 Geo Metro LSI had worse features and yet still cost $11,121 for something with [pretty minimal features](https://www.cars.com/reviews/los-angeles-timess-view-1420689068837/) - fewer than even a bottom-rung vehicle like the Versa has today.

The 1990 Ford Festiva was cheaper but was even more lacking. At $7,750, it *is* appreciably cheaper but it doesnt include power steering, anti-lock brakes, a trip computer, stabilizer, tire pressure monitoring, the LATCH system for child seats, air conditioning, a Bluetooth hands-free phone system, a CVTCS, 46 less horsepower (63 vs 109),  auxiliary 12-volt DC power outlets, a 4-way adjustable drivers seat, the ability to play CDs or MP3s, an auxillary audio jack, a radio data system, speed-sensitive volume control, illuminated steering-wheel mounted audio controls, roof-mounted airbags, an ELR seatbelt system, modern crumple zones and buckling mechanisms

To put it bluntly, it is lacking a lot of features. Probably more than $4k worth.

Which would suggest that the inflation on at least some vehicles is probably pretty close to $0 - you're getting about as much value per dollar spent now as you were then, if not more.

As it turns out, inflation has not been anywhere near the CPI numbers. People have more and better stuff - houses have continued to get larger, people's stuff is better, they have new things (Internet, computers, tablets, laptops, cell phones, smart phones) that are considered staples which few people *had* in 1990... the list goes on. If you look at things like video games, like home movies, like computers, the nominal price of them has barely budged in decades. The first Apple computer cost $666 in the mid 1970s! Midrange computers have had the same nominal price for decades now. TVs have gotten better *and* cheaper, with higher resolution, better color displays, lesser power consumption, ect.

The reality is that simply multiplying together CPI numbers and claiming that is somehow "adjusting for inflation" over the course of decades is obvious nonsense. You'd have to argue that all of the improvements in stuff between 1990 and 2017 plus all of the new stuff people have is worth only $3,900.

If we look at the nominal price of 1990 quality goods in 2017, this is simply not the case - the improvements are much, much larger, and worth much more than $3,900/year.

This is why it is important to sanity check numbers before you throw them out there. It is pretty immediately obvious that a set of 1990 goods is worth far less than a set of 2017 goods, and that the difference is much more than $3,900/year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The majority of people live in larger homes and living spaces.

Median means the 50th percentile. That's the middle of the road. You're seeing an increase over time.

 Aww hell, why not just go straight to the real source?

Right. The real source which *disagrees with the other sources*.

Whoops!

The 62.9% level was anomalous; the present rate according to the Census Bureau was 63.6%. As it notes, that is not statistically significantly different from what it was in the first quarter of 2016, despite it being over a year and a half later. Indeed, the measure is a statistical measure which is done via polling.

 A little sob story? So, death thanks to poverty is less important than the point you apparently want to make but won't just say? What is wrong with you?

You do realize there's this thing called medicaid, right? It is for poor people. There's also medicare. There's also health insurance. These things all are things which exist.

Why was he not on some sort of government program? The government cannot help you if you don't seek out help; they don't have magical poor people sensing abilities. You have to actually sign up for the programs.

What medications were "pocket change" five years ago which were unaffordable now?

These are all kind of crucial elements of your little fiction.

 You seem to have missed the point that he owned a mortgage brokerage, and five years ago his medical expenses would have been trivial for him. You also seem to have missed the point that he lost everything in a divorce. You further have missed the point that we're discussing this in comments for an article that asserts that getting and staying out of poverty requires an extended lack of misfortune.

Yeah, see, the problem is you're citing a pack of lies and you're spewing out a pack of lies. The article is garbage and has no relevance to his situation whatsoever, because he wasn't poor initially. Moreover, the argument that people magically become poor because of a single unfortunate event just isn't true; if it was, we'd expect lots more poor people than we have. Lots of people undergo financially stessful events all the time, but IRL, people recover.

If he really "lost everything", then why wasn't he on government assistance? We do have programs for poor people.

 That "sob story" demonstrates how one event can knock somebody into poverty even to such a degree that it ends their life.

Except it doesn't. At all.

 What are you claiming that I've lied about?

Everything. Your entire presentation of reality.

Even your user name is a lie.

 We're discussing the United States of America.

Yes, a country where we have a social safety net. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm calling out dishonesty for what it is.

I pointed out houses were getting bigger. You then lied and said that normal people weren't able to afford those houses. I then pointed out that, no, not only is average house size getting bigger, but median house size is getting bigger as well - that, in fact, people are indeed living in larger living spaces over time, and that moreover, because household sizes are getting smaller, the living space per person is going up by even more than that.

You claim that health care is out of reach for people, when in fact we're seeing more and more people gaining insurance, and emergency medical care is legally required to be given.

You claimed that someone someone died from an easily preventable condition which was "pocket change" five years ago, and yet, you didn't name what the condition was, what the product in question was, how this could have come to pass, or anything else. And then in your response, you didn't even elucidate on this alleged event, which was supposed to be traumatic for you. I pointed out that this was bullshit, and *you didn't even respond with specifics* to demonstrate how wrong I was.

You seem to have forgotten you even included that little sob story.

If you're going to lie, at least keep your lies straight.

But you don't care about the truth.

The truth is that life is pretty good, and has been getting better for people for a long, long time.

Is the world perfect? Hell no. No one is claiming that.

But when you claim that the world is getting worse when it is actually getting better, lie about stuff which is readily falsifiable via a simple search, attempt blatant emotional manipulation, and desperately cling to said lies, what possible conclusion can I come to about the kind of person you are, and what your goal is?

*What is wrong with you?*

Seriously. This is an economics subreddit. Economics is serious business. It is numbers and statistics and attempted measurements of often fuzzy things. It is a super complex subject matter that even professional economists cannot always agree on.

But for fuck's sake let's not lie about what has *actually* happened.

There are serious things that people need to think about. How do we control the cost of housing and health care? What is causing price disease in some markets? What is the best way to alleviate poverty and work towards people having an even better standard of living? How can we work to get rid of poor areas and make them wealthier?

These are real issues and they are hard enough to deal with as-is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *My favorite Donald Trump joke:*

Angela Merkel visits Donald Trump in Washington.  During her stay Trump asks her: "Tell me Chancellor Merkel, what's the secret of your years of success?"

Chancellor Merkel responds: "Well I have always surrounded myself with intelligent people."

"Very interesting", says Trump, "but how exactly do you know if they are intelligent?"

"Well I just ask them a couple of simple questions. By their response I can quickly determine whether someone is intelligent or not."

"Would you mind showing me how to do that?" Trump asks.

Angela picks up the phone and calls Wolfgang Schuble, her Minister of Finance and asks: "The son of your father but it's not your brother. Who is it?" The Minister replies: "That's easy, it's obviously me!"

Totally impressed Trump returns to the oval office and calls up his Vice-president Michael Pence. "Mike I have a question for you. It's the son of your father but it's not your brother. Who is it?" Michael stalls for a moment, not knowing the answer. He tells Trump that he will sleep over it.

In the morning he wakes up still without a solution. So he rings up Barack Obama and passes the riddle to him. Obama immediately respons: "Well that's me!"

Relieved Michael calls up Trump and exclaims: "I got the answer to your question...it's Barack Obama!!!"

After a moment of silence, Trump explodes: "No you idiot, it's Wolfgang Schuble!!!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think laws to do with patenting life, if it was decided to be legal, should be very carefully thought out.

Such patents are nothing new; we've been patenting varieties of plants for a very long time now (long before GMOs were a thing). It isn't hazardous ground because it isn't really anything special; gene patents are not nefarious. Indeed, the original versions of some GMOs are now no longer under patent protection, which has incentivized Monsanto to develop new and improved versions.

 I'm largely in favor of GMO's, though I do think governments should fund or incentivize long term and less immediately profitable research.

I don't really see a lot of issues with GMO funding right now, at least as far as plants go.

 When you say intelligence science, are you referring to human, animal, machine, or metaphysical science? (Philosophy in the case of the latter) Regardless of which you meant though, show me the data, how you got it, and if it's convincing, I'll believe it.

Human intelligence is the one that people get very bent out of shape over. [Here's a paper from the 1990s about it.](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997mainstream.pdf) It is basically a summary of findings in the field, which came out in response to a lot of people being upset over *The Bell Curve*.

The TL; DR; is that:

1) IQ is a measure of intelligence, specifically g, the general intelligence factor, and properly administered IQ tests are a good measure of it (no, those online "IQ tests" are not any good).

2) IQ is strongly related to many important outcomes - educational, occuplational, social, and economic. It is basically important in everything.

3) IQ is highly heritable, with a heritability of about .75 in adulthood. This has been found by a number of studies.

4) There is a big gap in average IQ between blacks and whites of approximately 15 IQ points (1 standard deviation) in the US. This does not mean that all black people are less intelligent than white people; it means that the distribution is skewed. The average for whites is about 100; the average for blacks is about 85. You see a bell curve around those peaks, which means that you see diminishing numbers the further away from those averages you get. Having an IQ of 115 as a black person is about as unlikely as a white person having an IQ of 130. The average for Hispanics fall between whites and blacks; the average for Asians and Jews fall above whites.

5) The cause of in-group variation appears to be primarily genetically mediated, though some environmental factors are also believed to play a role; the cause of between-group variation in the United States is unknown, though sme have been largely ruled out. The cause of within-group and between-group variation may not be the same.

Another summary paper about the same subject which came out around the same time was [Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns.](http://differentialclub.wdfiles.com/local--files/definitions-structure-and-measurement/Intelligence-Knowns-and-unknowns.pdf) It is rather thicker reading than *Mainstream Science on Intelligence*, but also goes into more depth about stuff, including the Flynn Effect (a long-term increase in average IQ of about 3 points per decade). It also includes a lot of citations, if you're interested in looking for them.

If you want to look at the actual data, the sources cited in the *Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns* paper and various Wikipedia articles about it are a good place to start. A lot of major papers and research studies have been cited there.

I'd recommend keeping in mind, always, that you should avoid drawing vast conclusions from half-vast data. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The black-white IQ gap (and other race/IQ population level correlations), the correlation of income with IQ, the high heredity of adult IQ (and conversely, the relatively low environmental contribution to variation in adult IQ in the US and other developed countries), the very notion of g-theory (the general intelligence factor, which is typically measured via IQ tests) - these are well accepted within the portion of the scientific community responsible for measuring and analyzing these psychometric attributes because there is a massive amount of evidence supporting them.

But a lot of people on the left totally flip their shit if you even talk about them, and a lot of people don't like the idea of people doing research in these fields at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Home ownership rate has also been on a downward trend for the past decade. See page 5 of the census report: https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf

The reason it has been on a "downward trend" is because a decade ago was 2007, which was the start of the housing crisis.

You remember, that thing where people bought too many overpriced houses?

It is almost as if people buying houses they could not afford was the direct cause of the housing bubble!

House ownership today is about the same as it was in the mid-1990s, as shown by the graph.

 For those below middle class life expectancy hasn't not increased much it seems.

 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/18/the-government-is-spending-more-to-help-rich-seniors-than-poor-ones/

This is one of those convenient little lies, which of course the Wonkblog is fairly infamous for, being, well, tripe.

As it turns out, life expectancy is most heavily influenced by a few factors in the US - deaths from accidents and homicides (which cut off people's relatively long lifespan early, often in their 20s, which causes a large proportional decrease - a 1% increase in the rate of people dying in their 20s will cut half a year off of life expectancy), deaths from obesity, and deaths from drug use.

And as it turns out, the differentials in these have been growing.

Poor people smoke at a much higher rate than people in higher income demographics - [over 30% of poor people smoke,](http://www.gallup.com/poll/105550/among-americans-smoking-decreases-income-increases.aspx), while only about 13% of people who make $100k+/year do so. This is by far the largest factor driving the lifespan differential.

There's differences in rates of [obese and sedentary](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/60/11/2667) persons as well - only about 27% of the top 20% were obese in 2010, compared to 32% of the bottom 20%, and only 22% of the top 20% are sedentary, compared to 30% of the poor. (The Daily Kos suggests slightly higher figures - 31% vs 37% for obesity).

And while homicide rates have fallen, they've fallen more for people who are better off than people who are worse off - there two orders of magnitude difference in homicide rates between the best and worst parts of the US.

Overall, smoking rates have declined, but obesity has gone way up since 1980. But as you can see, they haven't changed uniformly across the population.

As is noted by the Daily Kos article about the same thing:

 [The first inclination might be to think "that's because the poor have limited access to health care," and that that will improve in the future thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and more so if we continue to build on the ACA and add more improvements. However, limited access to health care doesn't account for many of the nation's premature deaths. More than anything, the gap, again, seems to be behavioral, starting with smoking.](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/21/1487054/-The-gap-in-life-expectancy-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-is-growing-instead-of-shrinking)

Average life expectancy has climbed. Life expectancies would be even higher if people weren't so fat; alas, obesity has counteracted some of the other gains.

It should also be noted that [where you live makes a big difference in terms of life expectancy, especially if you're poor.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/11/upshot/for-the-poor-geography-is-life-and-death.html?_r=0 mtrref=www.slate.com gwh=9D8AA474A796613E71334BE0DC3C910A gwt=pay)

Lifestyle choices like obesity and smoking are very difficult for the government to simply legislate away, and a lot of people resent heavy police presence being used to deal with crime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is that you're thinking of formal logic. In formal logic, an argument from authority is a fallacious argument.

Real life doesn't operate on formal logic, though. The strength of evidence is dependent on the people presenting said evidence, because we cannot assume that assumptions are true in real life.

This is the major difference between science and logic. Science is probabilistic, because real life is probabilistic.

This is actually specifically noted in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority):

 A valid argument (Latin:argumentum ad auctoritatem) is one in which a recognized authority on the relevant subject is appealed to by citing a statement by that authority. This is a form of inductive reasoning in that the conclusion is not logically certain, but likely.

An argument from authority adds valid weight to the argument when you are sourcing something from a recognized authority on the subject. Attacking such arguments often relies on showing that the source is not a recognized authority or that they are simply flat-out wrong in their conclusions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't actually true, though. Understanding the science for climate change isn't difficult - you can look at the temperature data, look at how it is collected, look at the methods, ect.

If you don't understand how someone came to a conclusion, you shouldn't hold a strong belief that it is true.

You don't need to accept the expertise of climate scientists to recognize that global warming is real; the data speaks for itself, and is collected via reasonable methodology.

The same applies to numerous other fields.

Most science *isn't* difficult to understand if you actually spend the time to look into it.

Even quantum mechanics you can understand why they came to at least some conclusions without any sort of advanced knowledge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Social sciences are even more prone to bullshit than the hard sciences are. They also are much harder to create controlled experiments for.

That's why we call them the soft sciences - they're a lot fuzzier and they're even more prone to bias.

I mean, look at economics. Economists can't even tell you what the effect of raising the minimum wage to such and such a level would be. That seems like a simple question, but it is not something that "Economics" has an answer for, while, say, physicists can tell you in detail about the physical motion of bodies through space in entirely theoretical circumstances.

I read a sociology thing earlier today which purported to show that rich people are less considerate of others because luxury car drivers are less aware of their surroundings (less likely to check for pedestrians, for instance). This is obviously problematic because the majority of rich people don't drive luxury cars, luxury car drivers are known to be worse drivers than rich people who buy non-luxury cars (insurance companies charge luxury car owners a higher insurance rate not only because the cars are more expensive, but because their drivers are more accident-prone) and indeed, across the total population, poor people are much more likely to die in automobile accidents than rich ones. The problem was that they chose a very bad proxy which would have been immediately obvious with a Google search or a call to an insurance company. They didn't even do basic research which would have told them that their proxy for rich people was a bad one, and it took me less than ten minutes to do said research. Anyone who did peer review should have been able to determine this in ten minutes as well.

And yet, this garbage somehow got published. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People on the left reject science too. Ask them about intelligence science, or economics, or crime statistics, or GMOs.

They pretend to embrace science, but they really have a very anti-scientific ideology and often have a great deal of ignorance about these matters.

The thing is, everyone understands that science is important, which is why so many people make appeals to science these days. But a lot of people don't really understand how science works for what science is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The idea that leftists are science-driven is obvious nonsense to begin with.

Socialism was discredited by economists over a century ago, but you still see people promoting it on the left.

There's the whole anti-GMO, anti-pesticide thing on the left.

People on the left get very upset about crime statistics.

People on the left get very upset when you point out that there's no state-by-state correlation between gun ownership rates and homicide rates, and that indeed, amongst demographic groups, blacks own fewer guns than whites but have a much higher homicide rate.

People on the left get upset about economic analysis which comes to conclusions they don't like.

People on the left often get upset about intelligence studies.

The list goes on.

They think themselves scientifically minded because they accept evolution and global warming, while ignoring the fact that many people on the right accept those things as well, and failing to pay attention to their own internal biases.

That's not to say that people on the right don't have their own biases - as this study notes, both sides are about as bad - but people tend to be blind to their own failings.

I'm a liberal. When I point out things which are against liberal orthodoxy, people get extremely angry and accuse me of being a conservative, a racist, or whatever else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That metric is also flawed. Those bigger houses are unattainable for ownership by the majority, and rent for smaller dwellings consumes the majority of household income for most.

Empirically false.

https://www.aei.org/publication/todays-new-homes-are-1000-square-feet-larger-than-in-1973-and-the-living-space-per-person-has-doubled-over-last-40-years/

Average house size and median house size have both climbed (and indeed, climbed together) even as household size has declined, meaning that space per person has grown *even more*.

 There is higher quality medical care, but it too is prohibitively expensive to the point that for most it is inaccessible.

This is nonsense. Why do you believe obvious nonsense? Average life expectancy has gone up and more people are insured and receive health care than ever before.

 But you still completely miss the point. Living in terror is not compensated for by a gadget. Having no hope of achieving a higher quality of life of your own volition robs human beings of the same traits that have allowed us to progress this far: yearning for better, self-actualization, and adaptability.

This is simply a lie.

The people who claim this are universally evil people who are trying to manipulate you by lying.

Look at your views. Then look at reality. *They don't match up.*

Why is this?

Who benefits by lying to you about how bad your life is?

Evil people who are trying to manipulate you.

Once you understand this, the solution is clear: turn on them.

 Modern poverty robs people of their humanity. They can not afford to assert even their fundamental human rights in court of law. When I read Frederick Douglas' description of slavery, the only difference I see between that and modern poverty is that today's wage slaves are not beaten with whips.

People have the *right* to legal representation, and contrary to what you believe, public defenders generally do a good job of representing people in court, even when they can't afford legal representation.

Look it up.

 I am paid more than two times minimum wage for my area, but I will likely never buy a house. My uncle owned his own mortgage brokerage, and one divorce reduced him to the point that I cradled him like an infant as he took his last breath thanks to a health issue he could have had treated with pocket change five years ago.

You're blatantly lying. Why?

You have said nothing specific. Absolutely nothing. Why? Why not cite the specific thing? The specific prices?

The answer is because you are deliberately engaging in manipulation. You're just not telling the truth.

Medical care has not gone from "pocket change" to can't be afforded in five years.

 One twist of ill fortune is all it takes to slam the door in your face.

This is a lie. But it is a convenient one.

Did you know that your mentality - the false belief that your own actions don't control your destiny - are strongly predictive of future earnings?

It's true. If you believe that hard work doesn't pay off, you earn much less money on average than if you believe otherwise.

Why?

The answer is because people with such mentalities do not work as hard. After all, it doesn't matter, so why should they care? They don't work to better themselves, they don't believe that they can do better, be more.

Once you buy into this obvious lie, defeat is almost assured. After all, you're already signing yourself up for defeat.

Maybe you should look at yourself and ask, "Are my problems entirely because of my own behavior?"

Maybe you should look at yourself and ask, "Why do I save less money than the average person in China, who makes vastly less money than I do?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem with such "adjustments" is that it assumes that marijuana is not a contributing factor to them; i.e. if marijuana users are more likely to be in demographics which get in more crashes and use more alcohol, it may well be that part of the reason why those demographics are more likely to have accidents is use of marijuana. In other words, your adjustment may be adjusting for the very factor you're trying to measure.

The correct way of doing this is to compare people with and without marijuana in their systems and looking at their relative car crash rates within a given demographic, not doing such gross demographic adjustments.

Numerous studies have found that marijuana - and especially marijuana in combination with alcohol - impairs people's driving ability. The fact that it shows up disproportionately often in car crash victims suggests that there's probably a link. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, and incidentally, another reason why that Scientific American article is obvious garbage:

[Poor and undereducated people are more likely to die in car crashes.](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/poor-people-die-car-crashes-study-article-1.2385596)

How does this square with their implication of rich people not paying attention to other people on the road?

The actual answer is fairly simple: they used a shitty proxy. [Luxury car drivers are somewhat more likely to get in automobile accidents,](http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/study-luxury-drivers-crash-more-often-20130419-2i4pp.html) but [most rich people don't drive luxury cars.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2011/12/30/what-the-rich-people-really-drive/#131d3bc14e04) And indeed, a lot of rich people buy cars with *above-average* safety records.

This explains the problem - they're not measuring all rich people. The rich people who drive luxury vehicles are the most accident-prone rich people. Thus, they're looking at an unrepresentative sample of the population of rich people.

Indeed, had they simply asked an insurance company this question, they would have gotten this answer. In fact, they may well have deliberately chosen a bad proxy in order to draw the conclusion they wanted. A simple google search or call to an insurance company could have told them that their study was worthless for drawing the conclusion they were trying to draw. This shows a high degree of sloppiness at best, if not outright scientific fraud. </TEXT>

 After alcohol, marijuana is the drug most often found in the blood of drivers involved in crashes.

Note that it is harder to link marijuana to car crashes than alcohol due to them being metabolized at different rates and lingering in the body for different periods of time, a difficulty noted in the article. Marijuana is known to impair driving, and for a longer period of time after use than alcohol, though the acute impairment tends to be lower. </TEXT>
