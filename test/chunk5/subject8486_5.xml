	<TEXT> This will, however, only let you target TO countries.  So you'll have to list out all the countries you want the post to go to, instead of excluding.  I have a vague sense that Hootsuite Enterprise (and maybe other enterprise tools) let you save specific audiences - so you would only have to set up the lengthy include list once. </TEXT>

Most of the content is now on the pay site, http://www.bostonglobe.com, but if you know how to Google, you can probably figure out how to read it for free (and links from Reddit or other social media will get you that article free).  Kevin Cullen, Adrian Walker, and Yvonne Abraham are the go-to columnists, IMHO.

http://www.wbur.org is doing an increasingly good job of covering local politics.

	<TEXT> I commute to Dorchester daily. Porter to JFK/UMass takes about 20 minutes - maybe 10 minutes more at rush hour when there's more waiting for the train ahead to clear a station.  But it's a lot less stressful to sit in the train and chill than to sit in rush hour traffic on the Pike (and better for the environment, too). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but you go north, [outside of 128](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=bedford+ma um=1 ie=UTF-8 hq= hnear=0x89e39ecffadc32ab:0xf9d207b082f4cc80,Bedford,+MA gl=us sa=X ei=r0eaUaqpKey20QGd24H4Aw ved=0CJIBELYD) to head to Bedford. I think the 128 boundary is reasonable. </TEXT>
