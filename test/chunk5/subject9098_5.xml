	<TEXT> Fast travel is a great idea, I've completed all optional missions, but Cassandra's, I hated that boat/truck thing.

Turn signal would be just aesthetic, even because NPC's cars can do that

The 60's were great for motorcycles, 60's davidson were awesome

By harsher I really meant things such as traffic tickets and the like, much like the AI from the first game, if you changed cars in the same zone it would take sometime for them to notice that was you, but in this current game, you can change cars three times, but if you are still in the blue zone they notice you right away.

The good thing about petrol is that when you hijack someone else's car - even though with the skill to call for one I would hijack a lot of cars - there are cars with more or less petrol, adding petrol, or even an animation to refuel your tank would be nice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to say that I played the first game several times, the second one I've played only once, so I don't remember if the features were discontinued on the second game.

Public transportation - tramway and trains were present and you could take them, small feature but it is nice to know that we have them. Also, I didn't find as much taxis as I would expect from a city as New Bordeaux.

Reloading weapons inside a car - I like to have the magazine of my weapon filled, but sometimes I get into the car and only then I see that I have just one bullet in it, I would only be able to reload it - automatically - if I shot.

Turn signal - really small feature that you would rarely see in Mafia, but was still there. If you held the key, either left or right, inside a car for some time, the turn signal would blink.

Motorcycles - a promise for the second game, never delivered, how hard can it be to implement a motorcycle in this series?

"Harsher" police - the first game had that point right, did you run a red light and a cop saw? You will have to pay, scratched someone's car? Pay. It is easier to get money in this game, so paying for a traffic ticket wouldn't be a problem.

Petrol - even though you can call Burke for another car, being able to fill your car would be better.

Edit: I've just remembered a feature that Godfather had that would be nice to implement on this game, if you shoot in someone's shoulder that was carrying the gun, they would drop the gun, if the knee, they would fall down. </TEXT>
