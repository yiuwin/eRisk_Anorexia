	<TEXT> I think less than 1 in 50 company's will hire anyone else.

Tax cuts don't really create long term job creation.

Reducing overburdened jurisdiction do.. when you need to spend 30 grand just on approvals for an expansion in some councils like my famioys ho when they wanted to add 30metres of extra warehouse grounds.

And if there is positive cash flow is  when a company expands.
Tax cuts are good and needed. But it doesn't help when the consumer has no extra cash to spend as goods are becoming more outstripped than wage growth  

The main figures that ppl are using to say  OMG tax cuts create jobs are usually from the more right wing side of the discussion or the govts modeling which of course will back up there statments </TEXT>

the ATO has  up to 3 months to send you the money.

Yet if you have to owe the govt money/CENTRELINK DEBTS.
Your a criminal you get a debt notice and u can go to jail. it's give me my money now.

Sort of one rule for us one for them.

It's rarely cheaper though.
Not when you factor in actual inflation  and a waranty.

I bought a  coutara years ago from amazon took me 3 months just to get them to sort out waranty.

Meanwhile i crack the screen on my new solar and they fixed it in 1 day. at the shop.

But there are some overpriced shit.

I buy all my clothes online as i know they fit.
but id rarely buy something with a moving part online from an overseas supplier it's not worth the lack of warranty

Why they order it in for you.
it's 2017 now anyway who the fuck needs a watch.  i only bought my new one cause i had  a gift card to the shoping mall the jeweler was in so though fuck it and paid the diff.

Goes this is for next door can you sign it.

So aus post let a random no body sign for something  that was mine.
They are meant to leave a note for me to come collect it.

Dear Aus post.

1061 babys where put up for abandonment.
thats 1 year.
In 1 state?

So yeah.
Not everyone has family.
those kids are destined to bump around the foster system for there entire life in most cases since only 37 of every 100 kids in the system gets adopted.

My brother in law mother died in child birth with no next of kin on that side of the family.
His father passed away when he was 7.  only 1 uncle who then died when he was 12..
So again your entire argument has fallen on it's head.

even if EVERY SINGLE job vacancy  today  62,719  jobs was filled.

There is still then 732,109 ppl left without work.
So what do they do?.

Lower taxes  does not always create jobs.

Ireleand has 12.5 percent for trading entity tax rates  one of the lowest in the devoped world.
yet still has  9.2 percent unemployment.
and a 27 percent under employment rate..
So where's all the companys flying in to create jobs.
No...


Pirvate enterprise can only create so many jobs.
there will always be unemployed ppl as thats how a labor market works.
So those few   hundred thousand ppl should wat?.
Go fuck themselves.

That is why we have a safety net.

	<TEXT> There is asking for less welfare. And then there is asking for it to be gone. Your post seemed pretty hairy is all.

You use welfare everyday to go to work.  Who are you to then turn around and say ppl should seek help from family when they don't have any instead of accessing services that ppl have agreed are an australain right of the fair go. Yet ur allowed to use the services other ppl hve paid for was my argument.. that's hypocrisy at a grand level.   


We have welfare cause.
It reduces crime. If we did not have the dole  imagine how  many home robberys there would be.
Even John Howard has openly said that the new start program is an effective crime control program.
Australia is built on the ideals of the fair go  that's why most ppl in the community approve of centrelink and why govt fairs badly in the polls  when they cut welfare. But then Give 6 billion in corporate tax cuts  to mining company's..

The govt keeps telling everyone to tighten the belt.
Yet it has money to let mps fly to qld to buy a unit from a mate.
It has the money to find  to give 600million to a liberal party donor  aka sarina Russo.
Yet we need to  find 45 million by making ppl wait 6 months for the dole.

The ppl have spoken they approve of the social safety note and the lnp still has not woken up to this fact. </TEXT>

This govts logic is pure hero derpy.
Govt wants you to get off the dole and get a job.

You get a job.

Govt then creates a  broken it system that averages out ur income where u might have got the dole for 2 weeks .

	<TEXT> It's literaly a lighter HP spectre.
Get one of those mate.
much better Panel on the Screen as well with the spectres.
The panel for the LG screen seems to  from user reviews suffer from some colour uniformity and back light bleeding.
LG has done this before with it's other  laptops they seem to have piss poor quality control id say.

Reason it's not  for sale here is cause there is no market for it.
We are oversaturated with "ultralights" right now.

Also it's batter last barely 80 percent the time it is stated to according to both Cnet and Linus tech tip

Few other things you could look at 
Dells new 14 inch flipscreen is pretty boss as well.
and its 15 percent off right now and you can stack an NRMA membership onto it to make it  20.

The asus  ultrabook also is pretty good for mobile productivity and i can confirm. that the battrey goes for a pretty solid  Flight from syd to  Hawaii   watching movies the whole way  with  still about 20-25 percent left in it

LG marketing in Australia is very quick to turn over new products. the new LG gaming screens  came out in the US  then 2 days later suppliers here got them.
The new Z series LG grams came out in October the fact it's now April and we still don't have local stock makes me think we probably wont get it.
but as i stated above there are literally a handful of better  ultralights for less or same money.
last weekend costco had the spectres for about 1099 AUD.
Thats like 600 below Anywhere else i had seen  but those fucking flew out the doors like a scott morrison budget commitment when they hear miners need more tax cuts

	<TEXT> All we have to do is do what the IT sector and 100 other companys do.
advertise for the position of   immigration minister.
Yet when ppl come in to apply tell them the rates on 9.20 an hour.
No one will take it  as a :normal" person can not live on that wage.
We can then say we have found no local skilled workers,and then  apply for 457 status for the minsters job.

	<TEXT> Omg. Can we stop taking photos of beaches and sunrises. That don't really have anything to do with Australia.

Yes it's a great country.
One of the best.
But having beaches and sunrises are not Australian the whole world has sunrises.
I don't mean to be rude.
But holy fuck like every 2nd day we get one of these.
By the logic of these posts   you should be able to post about any subject in this subreddit  just if take a photo of it or do it in australia, it automatically is australian </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact u mentioned exetel and neglect to know it's the 2nd most complained isp to the tio means u clearly should not be commenting on the matter.

Exetel complaints to the tio in 2016 was 7230  Yet it only has 22000 customers so yeah    



Telstra are only good cause it's users get roped by them so it has plenty of  data in the pool.


The current top 5 Nbn isps in order by customer satisfaction are.

1.Aussie broadband.
2.leaptel.
3.skymesh  but wait times are Shit.
4.optus.
5.***ausbbs

Optus I'd steer clear of if it not in Nsw or qld though there core routers are having mondo issues right now.

Try to steer clear of most of the isp that offer unlimited on 100mbit plans and they look too cheap to be true they usually are.

If u know they use aapt.
Run.
Run and hide.
Unless u want to have whole weekend's where core routing goes offline  </TEXT>

ACCC...
made NBNco create 122 points of interconnect.
making it harder for smaller isps or any isp for that matter to provide enough backhaul to every consumer.
when nbnco wanted 12 points of interconnect under labors plan and a 8 dollar CVC charge  compared to the 15 we have now..

5 years later  is butthurt that isps have slow speeds on the nbn...

Uhmmmm what..
