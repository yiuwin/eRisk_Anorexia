	<TEXT> Also, there was no real reason for you to be against the Templars in AC3. You're just told that they are evil and so deserve to die, and so you follow. They don't really have much of an evil master plan, they just seem to want to be in control. Also, the reason Connor hates them, his village being burned, comes out of nowhere with no justification. Even Hatham doesn't even know it happened. 

The game gives you no motivation to be behind Connor, and this, coupled with an increasingly uninteresting story as the plot progresses, caused a lot of people to just become bored by the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So did i. I thought AC2 was a better game, but i really liked 1 just for it's atmosphere and setting. The Crusades has been by far my most favourite historical period the series has gone to. Something about the dirty, grimy nature of everything, and walking through the markets with all the store owners advertising their wares really tickled me.


AC2 was much too sparkly. AC3 had rubbish cities and the frontier got really boring </TEXT>
