	<TEXT> I know what you mean, my mom used to be a lot more physically violent when I was a kid too.


When you're a helpless child, they just feel entitled to do whatever they want with you, since they consider you completely THEIR child to do with whatever they see fit. Now that you're older and going to university they're laying off the physical abuse, but the verbal and emotional shit is still as bad. The way I see it, it's really all about control. They use it as a tactic to scare you into doing what they want. 


I know it's hard, but putting up with it for now seems to be the only way to go about doing things. Especially if you're leaving for university soon! Even if you can't get a scholarship, you can look into other programs like study abroad, where you can study in a completely different country for a while, or if the university you want to get into has some financial aid in the form of student loans or different payment plans (look at the interest rates and make sure they aren't too expensive!). 


Now is your chance to really experience life away from your father's rule, but just remember, if it doesn't work out all that well this year, there's always the next couple of years and unfortunately, you'll just have to be patient and work towards your goal of freedom. 


If you're credentials aren't that great to get you a scholarship this year, work your tail off your freshman year of university (even if it's still close to home) and you might be eligible for tons of scholarships and programs at far off universities. I don't know which universities you're looking at, so I can't tell you which scholarships exactly, but trust me there are tons of scholarships for people for tons of different things. You just gotta know where to look. 



I recommend visiting the scholarship resource office at the university that you want (if they have one). They should be really helpful in helping you find potential scholarships. 


I'm 21. I work part time and me and my bf are trying to save up money so that we can rent a little cheap apartment soon! Nothing fancy, just so that we can escape and live our lives. It takes a lotttt of patience and discipline, but I'm sure it'll be worth it soon! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my experience, calling the police really wasn't worth it. 


I only ever called the cops on my mom once, and unless you have a safe place to go to after you do it, or your life is in immediate danger, I don't recommend it. 


I did it cause she was trying to suffocate me and I didn't know what else to do( or what I had even done wrong in the first place for her to just wake up one morning and start beating on me and my sis). So out of delirium and confusion, I made it to the phone and called. 


They came 10 minutes later, and she went outside and started her crying and putting on this whole act of a poor, helpless mother. Saying that her kids were just plain evil and wouldn't listen to her and she was forced to whack them around. They believed her little act (she's a great liar/manipulator) and decided that we were just disobedient children who needed to respect our mother more.


After they left, EVERYONE was mad at me. My brothers, the sister I was trying to protect, my uncles, and when news reached back to the family, my grandparents and my aunts. 


In their book the very worst thing you can do is call the police on your parents even if they are trying to kill you. So unless you want your whole entire family hating your guts and your parents making your life even more miserable after the police leave (if you still have to live with them) I don't suggest doing it. 



And if you really want to jail your father, you should consider some things first.


 Do you have proof that he's being abusive towards you (e.g. bruises, marks, broken bones)? Are you a minor? Do you have any younger siblings? If you put your father in jail, you may have to go into the foster care system if you have no other family that can support you. Not only that, but your younger siblings will more than likely be taken away if they suspect any abuse towards them. Do you have any older siblings you can live with? Any other good family you can stay with?



If you go through with it just try to figure out the consequences and if the pros outweigh the cons. More than likely, if the police take it seriously, your family will be broken up and if your family is anything like mine, they will be very angry towards you for a while.


 What's the main reason for you doing this? Do you feel like your life is at risk? Or are you doing it because some of your freedoms are being stifled. If its the former, try to hang on for a little while, until you're independent and can move out and safely say fuck you to their stupid rules and live your life. Foster care is really not a thing you wanna try. 


That's just my experience. I'm still working on the getting financial independent part though, and it's very hard and tests your patience, but I'm hoping it'll be worth it. Good luck on whatever you choose to do! </TEXT>

She has perfected the art of lying to the point where she can make you believe you were eating a hotdog even if you had a plate of mac n cheese in front of you.

	<TEXT> I know exactly how you feel! 


The best way I know how to get over that feeling is to either really express how I feel about it to him and we have a long talk about how it can be avoided and just to get it things off my chest. Or the other way I end up feeling more calm is by just taking some time for myself and having some space to do what I like just to get my head out of the whole long distance relationship dynamic  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm...I'm trying not to be negative, but my gut instinct thinks there's something fishy, along the lines of catfish. Why would she disappear just weeks before you were to meet? But you seem to have so much confidence in believing that she was being honest about herself, so don't take my word for it. It just seems strange. Otherwise, I'd say that maybe she got offended if she really was seriously sick, and you didn't know and unintentionally weren't as supportive or serious as she expected? I don't know, just throwing ideas here. It's a very strange circumstance and I hope you get your answers. Keep us updated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're confusing dating with having premarital sex. Just because you're dating someone, doesn't automatically mean you're having sex with them. 


Dating is all about getting to know a person. Getting to know their hobbies, their ambitions, their goals in life, etc. 


You can't assume that just because someone is dating, that they're automatically committing zina. 


And speaking on behalf of what all Muslims can or cannot do, because of what your interpretation of what dating "really means" is pretty arrogant and can ruin a lot of potential good relationships.  </TEXT>
