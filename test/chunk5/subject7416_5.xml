mewithoutYou - Brother, Sister 

La Dispute/Touch Amor - Searching for a Pulse/The Worth of the World 

Touch Amor/Pianos Become The Teeth- Split 

Finally got my hands on some of my all time favourite releases, especially As The Roots Undo which is one of my favourite screamo albums, and the Touch Amor/La Dispute, because they are my two favourite bands and I love that split to death. The Touch and Pianos split is really interesting as well, as both bands sort of ventured into uncharted territory, as it was the first time Pianos had clean vocals in a song, and Touch side of the split is to date stil their only song that is over 4 minutes long.   </TEXT>

Like obviously I think we should be kind and tolerant to people of all religions, but it just bothers me that a lot of people think it is somehow more narrow minded to laugh at the idea of heaven than reincarnation. Like if I am supposed to be open to chance that there might something about this world that is supernatural or spiritual, why can't that be something buddhistic instead of something christian? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well as someone who studies cultural anthropology I can't with a good concious call anything cultural appropriation, because there is virtually no solid academia on it. It is a thing that mostly exist in the think piece and blogosphere, but doesn't have a lot of value for people who take these things seriously.

Especially when it comes to something like dreads that is emperically proven to not be exclusive to any specific culture, as it is proven that people wore them in ancient Greece, and has used in almost all continents for hundreds if not thousands of years. To say that white people can't wear dreads holds no ground what so ever... sure I'll admit it looks incredibly lame, but that doesn't make it wrong.

Now if you wanna criticise people for misusing symbols, traditions, clothes, and hairstyles, and other cultural practices in inappropriate and rude and insensitive ways then that is perfectly okay, but we shouldn't call it something that it isn't. Just be honest and say that it is disrespectful and ignorant, and in some cases downright racist.

Because I do agree that it is ignorant of white (and black people as well) to for an instance misuse rastafarian symbols and language as part of some half-baked attempt to gain an identity, where they might wrongly stereotype it some sort of vague idea of cool colours, peace/love, and weed smoking, and ignore that is an actual religion. But that is also wrong when Snoop Dogg decided to use rastarian symbols as part of an image and performance, while not being part of that religion. 

And from a critical perspective are many other issues I have with cultural appropriation as well, although I don't want to lecture anyone or bore you to death. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How is being a sex worker any worse than being a coal miner for example

I never said it was, I am not against prostitution in theory, I just haven't read any sources that suggest that it would be safer for sex workers, and that it would reduce human trafficking. I never said all sex work is modern day slavery either, I am saying that human trafficking is part of the prostitution business. 

You are making a misguided attempt at characterising my comment as anti-sex worker, or anti-prostitution based on arbitrary morals standards, which just isn't the case. I agree that people should be have agency over their own bodies and use it as they wish, but the argument that was presented here was that legalising prostitution would reduce violence commited against sex worker, and I asked for proof of that. 

And again, before making more obscene accusations, I am simply saying that I want evidence (which you refuse to give me for some reason) that suggest that legalising prostitution in countries where it has been illegal for a long would make it safer for sex workers. 

And if several countries has legalised it, can you link me to some stats that proves that violence against sex workers has been reduced due that legalisation? Instead of yelling at me, accusing me of things I never said, just provide me with some information, because I am sure you guys have some if you are really confident about this. I am not unreasonable for asking for for some sources on this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well actually the burden on proof should be on the people making a claim, not the one questioning it. I am saying that without any sort of sources I can't responsibily believe in it, I need something more substantial than just someone saying that things are a certain way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is no respect in business, it's literally all about that bottom line.

Then again being disrespectful might be bad business, so at least appearing to be respectful is often important. Because displeasing your consumer is never a good idea, especially when you can't provide what they want, or don't have a monopoly on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it though? I see this claim all the time, but people never link to any sources to back it up, so correct me if I am  wrong but this seems more speculative than anything else. Like would it actually make sex worker safer? Would it reduce human trafficking? Because if so then that would be great, but I don't know if I believe that would actually happen in the way poeple claim it would.

Edit: Why the downvote? Can't a guy ask some questions? If you guys think that I am wrong, I am gladly willing to be proven so, but I would like at least some evidence.  </TEXT>
