	<TITLE> Is there an answer about how to change your "Favorite Bike"? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-17 18:46:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've googled and I've tested different things but I can't seem to get the "favorite bike" to change. Any ideas?

Edit: Just so we can avoid repeat info and speculation, here's what I've experienced and what I've tried:

 logged on after a long hiatus (this is post-CEO update) hopped on a Liberator and was told this was my favorite bike. (Didn't own a clubhouse and was not an MC Pres.)

 after I bought a clubhouse, rode the Bagger for a while, probably did several missions on it, that became my favorite. 

 now I'm trying to get my Gargoyle to be my favorite and have ridden it for hours and probably a thousand+ miles. 

 completed dozens of MC wall missions and supply and delivery missions with Gargoyle.

 moved the Gargoyle around in the clubhouse garage (though not every spot. I just traded spots with the Bagger and also put it in slot one)

 modified the Gargoyle.

 sincerely hoped with all my heart.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The two times I got $250,000, it was coming back from a break. I started to play a little while back after about a year or more break. They gave me $250,000. 

Then during spring break I went out of town and when I booted it up again after about a 10-day break, I got another $250,000. 

So my guess is they're rewarding people for coming back. Or at least it might increase their odds for RNG.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great collection!

I have to say I disagree with more than just a few of your IRL equivalencies. 

I know nothing here is 100% and the in-game cars all have bits and pieces of a few IRL cars, but I think more credence should be paid toward the creator's nomenclature. Like the new Vapid truck is probably not a Toyota, just as one example.

Nice collection, nonetheless.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally get your point. When I PvP in free mode (rare, these days because I/E) I always mixed it up. Sniper, then CQC with rifles or a shotgun, then bust out the mini gun for a kill or two, then switch to a rocket because he's ducked around a corner and won't come out, then back to rifles again when he spawns closer, etc. 

But to your point, if it's all gun battles, I'd get tired and want to see an explosion once in a while and, theoretically, one could go through a "explosion phase" that they're really enjoying. 

In the end, it's a pretty balanced game and it's the user base that skews it in one direction or another. 

Having said that, yes, custom servers would be nice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You had to be somewhat tech savvy. Basically people were redirecting GTA:O's server-side activity to their own computers via DNS manipulation. 

So now they had the power to host lobbies and control the variables that are normally server-side. 

The most common money "hack" was introducing bounties on people that was worth billions of dollars. 

If you got it out on you, all you had to do was survive it in a solo session and the money was yours. If you saw someone else in the lobby with it, you'd try to kill them. 

I managed to kill a $4B bounty and was so rich I couldn't spend all my money. I bought everything in the game. It was fantastic while it lasted. :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Way back in the DNS hacking days, I killed a player with a $4-billion bounty on his head. $4B is an unspendable amount of cash. 

You literally could buy, modify, and sell every car in the game over and over again, once a day repeatedly and in succession, and it would take you over a month to do it. $60B? I can't even fathom it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Omg I'm so back-and-forth on this. Now I think I should again. 

I mean I have $60M in the bank and the CEO stuff with maxed out garages and medium cargo warehouse. Pretty happy with my money-making ability right now. 

I wanted to do the MC coke as a change of pace -- and with the solo public lobbies I figured it's pretty doable. But if it's glitchy and half the missions are too hard to complete, it might be a waste of money. 

I would like to use the garage for bikes, though. That would be cool. Right now I have them all stored at a stilt mansion garage. 

What to do. What to do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In terms of apartment location, view, etc, I think Weazel towers 101 is the best. 

 centrally located

 top floor view

 three or more entrances to the garage if you're running from cops or other players or just in a hurry

 separate building walk-in entrance which is great for battling other players that are staking you out. You can exit from a different exit than where they're waiting.

 less populated and congested than Eclipse (which I also own)

 plus it's Nakatomi Plaza from Die Hard. So that pretty much seals the deal.  </TEXT>

I [created a 4x4 off road test track](http://rsg.ms/a6aefc9) a while back that you can use to test inclines and grip, etc. It's for PS4.

I've found the BeeJay is excellent and it's super cheap too. (Free if you find one to steal.) and it looks awesome all blacked out and has some cool customization options. Not a ton, but enough to make it look great. 

Give it a shot. Most people overlook the BeeJay for off road and so it's unique on top of everything else.  </TEXT>
