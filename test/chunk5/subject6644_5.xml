	<TEXT> Basically, I recovered from anorexia and self harm and have spent many years in treatment centers all over the U.S. Since recovering, I've learned I really have a unique set of skills and experiences to bring to the table and would love to help others whom I can relate to. So, I've been pursuing a degree in nutrition with the goal of becoming an eating disorder specialized dietitian. 

But recently I've been thinking that I've spent so long in the mental health bubble talking about my own feelings and whatnot, that maybe I need to do something totally different? I want to help people but also feel maybe I'm still holding on to that part of my life that I went through and now I'm all mixed up and am not sure if I should continue pursuing this or try to find something else that may interest me and fulfill me in other ways?

Any suggestions or help would be super sweet and appreciated x </TEXT>
