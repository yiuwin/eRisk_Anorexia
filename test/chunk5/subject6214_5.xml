	<TEXT> I think more for the fans. In an interview about Uno Dos Tr, Billie mentioned something along the line of that it was to please the population because we all have a very short attention span. So hopefully Revolution Radio is a back to basic fan pleaser 

Edit - I also love the trilogy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With the release of Bang Bang very soon, should we also be expecting a music video soon after. We saw the photo of Billie and we speculated a photo shoot/ music video. And the release of a music video seems to follow the pattern of a couple of weeks after the release of the single. 

What are everyone's thoughts? </TEXT>
