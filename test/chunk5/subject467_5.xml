	<TITLE> Religious people: what are you getting out of it when you read the bible/study the torah so many times? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I might read a book I like a few times but after that I'm pretty burned out. But more religious people i know will read the bible regularly in their spare time and have done for as long as I've known them.

I'm also cutting a documentary about Jews and there is a bit of an interview where one of them says that many Hisidic Jews will study religious texts for up to 6 hours a day. What do they get out of this that requires this much time input?

Edit: I should note i've not really been exposed to much in terms of religious practices outside of schooling and life in general. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its actually fairly simple.

First there are two types of fish really: Flat (Sole, Halubut, Skate) and Round (Mackrel, Salmon, Trout).

Round fish are much easier so its best to start with a few of them. 

It depends on the fish but you will want to begin by de-scaling the fish. I usually just do this with a bread knife by dragging it along the skin towards the head. Scales will fly everywhere so do it in a sink or somewhere you can wipe down easily.

Next you need to remove the guts. Take a thin knife and find the fish's pee hole on the bottom near the tail. Stick the tip of the knife in and slice through right up the belly to the head. Now you can just pull the guts out and rinse under cold water.

You just gutted a fish! Slash the skin, throw some butter and herbs in there in there, grill for 14 minutes and enjoy!

If you want the fillets then that is a little more work. Lay the fish on its side and cut a notch on each side behind the head all the way to the spine (dont cut through the spine). Next take the knife parallel to the bone from the notch behind the head and slice along all the way to the tail in a kind of smooth sawing motion as close to the bone as possible. Do the same for the other side. 

Now you have two (almost) fillets. They will have little bones in them that you will be able to feel when you run your fingers along the flesh. To get rid of these use a pair of tweezers and pull them out individually. Fillets!

	<TEXT> This is a good reply and is very much what I'm doing at the moment. I started out as an edit assistant 14 months ago (1st industry job) and ket showing them what i could do with graphics, literally making them wherever possible: straps, stings, titles. Even when the show really didn't need them to be honest. They got some good feedback for some of my graphics and they put me on that more or less full time. I built up a good show-reel from that and now i do freelance stuff on the side with a view to expanding in the future! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It occurred to me this morning that roughly 90% of my day is spent actively using the internet in some way. 

From waking up to internet radio and streaming some TV while i eat breakfast, working on my computer constantly sending and receiving graphics files and exchanging emails. Then in the evening i stream some music while i cook then while away the evening playing online games with a bunch of friends. A lot of these people I only share information with via the internet. I've known them for a year or so but without the internet I would have no way to get in contact with them.

I'm interested to see how many people would or wouldn't be affected by a sudden and permanent lack of communication...

	<TEXT> When I was about 7 we had just got a puppy. His name was Casper, he was a German shepherd and he was mine. One day I was swinging a large piece of wood around in circles (i was a boy growing up in a rural area) anyway, casper comes bounding over to see what fun I'm having. Not seeing him he gets clocked right in the head with the wood. 

He was ok but his little face when I realised what had happened broke my heart. It was just a look of "why?" I stood there in shock before going to cuddle the little bear and say sorry with tears in my eyes. We made up pretty fast and he grew up to be quite the dog but i never swung wood around again.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> After 250~ hours of CoH I just played my best ever game. And i didn't even win. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just have to vent this to those who will appreciate it! According to my steam account i have spent over 200 hours on CoH multiplayer. This doesn't include when i had a CD copy of the game so I'm willing to bet its rather more. That puts things into perspective when i can say without a doubt last night's game was the best i have ever played, and we lost.

It was a 3v3 VP 500 points on hill 331. Five of us on skype, 3 v 2 (+1 random guy). As the allies we were dominating the right hand side and putting up a good fight on the left. While our side was chatting away on skype like normal (giving things away somewhat) all we heard from the other side was some group chat messages from the random guy complaining about his team losing the right hand side of the map. This went on for a while as we had roughly 350pts left while theirs ticked all the way down to 40. We had tanks, calliopes and were dug in to fuck.

The chat messages were a ruse. We got sloppy thinking we had it in the bag. They stormed up the right with tonnes of tanks and tank repair vehicles while the ticker was still going down on their side.

It got down to 8 points before they took back two of the three points. It seemed like a minor setback at first but the more we tried to take back the middle/either side the more tank wrecks we gave them to repair and they just grew in strength. After sending a second wave of Pershings, Shermans and Cromwells we realised what we had done. There was not stopping them.

They kept their 8 points while their fully vetted tanks grew in number, swathed across the battlefield and waited for our 350 points to count down eventually to 0. At the end of the game the top player (randomer on the other team) had a total of 65000 points.

In Company of Heroes the battle is never won until its won.

I'll post up the replay later if anyone's interested. We'll all be getting together on skype at some point and doing a commentry of it to upload too.

	<TEXT> The first frame is when i render out a singe frame alone. The last three are random frames taken when i rendered out the whole 200 frame sequence.

I'm using GI, ambient occlusion and scene motion blur as well as a load of multi-passes for depth, shadows and buffers. I've not come across lighting errors like this and the fact that single frames are ok has me stumped. Has anyone come across this before? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ableton Live.

I've used everything from Logic to FLStudio, Cubase to Reason. They all have their advantages but Live is undoubtedly coming out on top. Its ridiculously versatile but what makes it brilliant is how easy it is to pick up.

Everyone has their favorite software but if you ask any electronic musician of recent years you can bet that live is in their kit list if not their primary DAW.

Fl studio is also easy to learn and is where i started, its brilliant don't get me wrong but it has a very backwards way of working that doesn't lend itself to moving into a more advanced DAW. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Her[27] Safety and normality Vs me [24] drive and adventure. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-15 02:53:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Weve been together four years, lived together for one and a half, broken up and got back together. The plan is that once i find a Job that i stick out for a year (planning on moving to London soon) she will move back in with me, I plan on marrying her and honestly look forward to starting a family together.

We are only dancing on this earth for a short while however, and i would like to see some more of this beautiful planet with my own eyes.

I moved around a fair bit growing up so i don't mind roaming for greener pastures, i am however aware that she has made a lot of concessions for the sake of our relationship while ive been studying and not reciprocated so much.

Work is her life: the safety, routine and stress keeps her busy. The restaurant industry is a cruel line of work though; high stress, low pay, long hours and ultimately draining. On her time off she socializes, gets drunk, watches her shows and looks forward to her holidays sunbathing. The problem is she doesn't seem to have much drive: she constantly vents about her job, boss and employees but will come up with myriad of reasons not to leave and find a less draining line of work.

Ive been a chef for a long while so i know the toils of resteraunt work but for the apst year ive landed a graphic design job which is fun and has a lot of potential money-wise. My plan is to do design for a while, go freelance then take a month out here and there to see a bit of the world: travel, adventure and gather inspiration. I would like nothing more than for my love to join me but she sees it as an absolute impossibility.

Where can we meet in the middle? Theres a time for safety, security and routine but the opportunity for spontinuity, fun and adventure is surely limited? Does she need to be broken from the reigns of an oppressive cuisine based regime? Or am i being selfish in my need to be free?

**TL;DR: She values safety, I need adventure.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was finishing up my chicken stock last night: strained it out then put on to boil to reduce. As I was smelling the steamy fumes it got me thinking that this must be losing or harming the flavor in some kind of way.

The other thing i noticed was that there was a lot more visible steam if i turned the heat down a bit. Does this mean it will reduce faster with a slightly lower heat? Or is it just a case of whacking t on full blast and boiling it down? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Minecraft is more creative than the vast majority of games sure but i can see how its worrying to see your child staring at a screen for hours without a break. 

Kids inherently don't know how to limit themselves and if left to it probably won't take a break for hours which from experience isn't healthy. As someone who works and plays in front of a screen I know the value of regular breaks! 

Everything in moderation, kids just need moderating sometimes!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So a copy of the latest game will set you back around 35 new but the latest version of Photoshop is in the order of 10 times that. They both have similar development times (games usually longer) so why is there such a disparity in price between software packages like this (Adobe CS, Cinema 4D, Office, etc) and games?

Is it just down to the units they are going to sell or is it price fixing because people only really have one choice once they start investing time in a suite? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a tip for the future: when shooting time lase its often good to ahve the shutter speed slightly longer than you think you need and adjust the aperture down a bit. 

A good rule to go by is having the shutter speed at half the interval between frames to give a really smooth motion (ie, if you are taking pics every 10s then the shutter speed should be set to 5s and the iso and apature set way low.) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What lenses would you buy for a C300? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-11-23 00:45:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I work for a production company (documentaries mostly) in the UK and we are looking at buying a new camera. I've pretty much settled on the Canon C300 as we've hired them out before and they have been great in terms of shooting and workflow. 

My question is what lenses would you pick for best value?

A cine lens would be nice but for documentary shooting a set of primes is definitely out of the question and at 15 000 upwards the rest of the range of zoom lenses is difficult to justify to the accountants!

We also use a 5D Mk3 for GVs and extra shots so we have a 24-70mm 2.8 and a 70-200mm 2.8 so there is the option of using those with the C300 in addition to whatever extra lenses we buy with it. I was looking at another all rounder such as a 24-100mm and then possibly a macro lens to go with it.

I guess my real question is will using EF lenses give a recognizable disparity in picture when comparing the footage to say that shot on our Sony PDW F800? </TEXT>
