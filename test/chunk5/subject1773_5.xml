	<TEXT> I have been fired from a therapist before. Someone who had seen me for 6 years on and off, and had been working with my dad for 8 years as well. When I got into the anorexic diagnosis, she said she could no longer help me and called my dad to tell him I needed residential treatment. However, she was not a therapist who specialized in eating disorders- not sure if that would make a difference or not.

I am seeing an eating disorder therapist now and I have brought up fears of being fired for not following my "recovery plan" and she said she doesn't expect everyone to right away and she would not fire me. If I dropped down to an underweight BMI again it might be a different story though.  </TEXT>
