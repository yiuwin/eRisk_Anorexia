I'm on a 3 day trip through Michigan sampling different beers along the way. Stared in Detroit, ended in Grand Haven (wanted to check out oddside). 

I've been in the service industry for a decade and know what characteristics I like in beer. I'll update you tomorrow :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Con man: An IPL with a weird smoky, fruity taste. (Not bad, not great)

Nuketoberfest: A classic octoberfest style brewed with Bavarian yeast.

Harvest Ale: A pale ale brewed with all Michigan hops and barley. (My favorite so far)

Unfinished Business: Described as a "Japanese empowers stout." 10 different malts and Japanese rice. (Very complex and interesting)
