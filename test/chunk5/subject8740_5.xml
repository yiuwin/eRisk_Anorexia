	<TEXT> I took that one and while I like what it was aiming for I laughed out loud when I got the result that I am "not privileged at all" 

Though I am a POC female with mental health issues (anorexia, depression, anxiety/panic attacks) and ADHD I still consider myself to be pretty darn privileged as I was raised by well educated parents in a safe, well off area with excellent public schools. Though I have mental health issues and an eating disorder, I had parents who could afford to get me treatment and had the time and motivation to educate themselves on what they could do to help me succeed. I have struggled, but I have always been in a situation that gave me access to the things I needed to overcome whatever I was faced with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doctors don't really make that much when you think about the amount of debt that they have to incur, the hours they work and the length of their training. To become a doctor (in the US) you need 4 years of undergrad, 4 years of medical school, at least 4 years of residency before you can fully start your career. While doctors make good money and are able to live comfortably not many are getting rich. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I prefer phone calls to texting; I don't really like talking on the phone but it is just so much more efficient to call someone up when you need answers. 

I'm not into the idea of casual sex. I would never judge someone for what they choose to do, but I personally see sex as something that should happen between 2 people in a loving, somewhat committed relationship. To me sex is something really intimate and emotional; if you only want physical pleasure just masturbate! 

I'm religious. I know that a lot of people are, but as a college student who travels in pretty liberal circles I feel "old school" for going to church every Sunday and always praying before I go to sleep. 

I'm probably going to get married young, but that isn't something I actively pursued; it is just the way things will probably work out. I don't really think there is any "ideal" age people should aim to get married at; heck, I don't even think people should feel like they have to get married at all!  </TEXT>

One time when I found out that my mom was making steak and potatoes for dinner I started crying and SCREAMED at her because in that moment I truly believed that she was trying to kill me with those toxic foods. 

Orthorexia isn't choosing to turn down a piece of cake (or whatever) it is feeling like you can't EVER eat certain things or terrible things will happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An LPN doesn't need a college degree to sit for the licensing exam; most are educated in 9-18 month long technical programs that focus on practical skills. LPNs and LVNs work under the supervision of an RN; legally they can't do anything without the direction of an RN or physician. They can do many of the same assessments as RNs but they are unable to interpret the data that they collect and make decisions about patient care. They tend to work in nursing homes, outpatient clinics and other subacute settings. 

RNs must at least an associates degree from an accredited school to sit for the licensing exam, though most employers prefer candidates with a bachelors. RNs have more of a background in "hard science" and have to take courses such as anatomy, physiology, psychology, pharmacology, pathophysiology, human development, statistics, biochemistry, organic chemistry in addition to their nursing skills classes and clinicals. They are able to do more advanced procedures, create and implement patient care plans and delegate tasks. RNs also have the ability to specialize their practice and earn additional certifications that can allow them do perform more invasive or complicated procedures.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm only a nursing student but I'm an outpatient pretty regularly because of my eating disorder and some medical complications. 

I was admitted as an inpatient this winter because I had severe electrolyte imbalances and had lost a lot of weight after getting my wisdom teeth out so my outpatient team was worried about refeeding syndrome or a major cardiac event. I think the weirdest part was seeing people in my schools scrubs doing their clinicals on my unit (especially since I was in a children's hospital). Other than that it was just boring; I couldn't get out of bed for the first few days and it was the first week of the semester so I didn't even have much homework to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YES! 

I work at a camp and this summer I have a girl in my group who has "bathroom issues". I'm not sure what her exact diagnosis is (or if she has one) but she ended up having multiple accidents last summer because she was embarassed to ask to go to the bathroom and didn't want to feel like she was different. Plus, she is like 8 years old and decides that she can hold it if she doesn't want to leave an activity. 

We have a lot of strategies to help her (code words etc.) but I think the best was making my whole group more comfortable with talking about their bodily functions; not in a gross way but just acknowledging that these things happen. I just frame it as another kind of diversity; some kids are super light and need to put on sunscreen more frequently, some kids are prone to overheating and need to take more breaks from running around, some people (me) have tiny bladders and need to go to the bathroom more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The summer camp I work at drug tests as part of the hiring process and I also have to get drug tested before I do any clinical rotations in school (I'm a nursing major). 

A failed drug test does not immediately get you kicked out of the program, but it will restrict what units you can rotate onto and you will be tested more frequently. I don't know of anyone who has failed; it's a super competitive program so nobody is taking any chances and we are warned WELL in advance about the test. 

It honestly doesn't bother me at all; neither of these jobs can be safely done by someone who is impaired and in a healthcare setting you have to worry about people diverting drugs from patients.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean as someone with an eating disorder; a lot of the things that we do can be healthy IF you are in a good mindset, have reasonable goals and don't take things to extremes. I justify my disordered behavior by telling myself that what I am doing is healthy, which would be true if I was practicing moderation and not already underweight. 

For me its the difference between choosing not to eat a cookie because you want to stay under your goal and you indulged yesterday and feeling like you CAN'T eat a cookie because if you do something bad will happen. Same thing with exercise; it can be healthy to exercise everyday but it shouldn't be upsetting or cause anxiety if you have to take a day off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not even petite and I shop in the kids section! I was actually browsing around in Target yesterday and the girls XLs looked a little big for me. 

I am 5'8'' and about 120 pounds, so I am underweight for my height but I'm still a tall, adult sized person and it baffles me that I can comfortably fit into a lot of kids stuff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unemotional nursing major checking in! I love gross things and like taking care of people; but I do not do feelings. Even at home I suck at using my words; I show people that I love them through my actions and I think that carries through to my professional life. I'm cool with it though; not everyone has to be touchy feely, nothing would get done if that was the case! I am a kind, caring person but I just don't understand emotions; I have learned how to deal with different situations by watching how others do it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm kind of the opposite; I have always been at the low end of healthy or underweight for my height and I'm scared to know what I'll look like in the middle or the higher end where my doctor says I should be. I developed anorexia around the time I started puberty, so I never really reached my "adult" weight as I was either restricting or trying to maintain the lowest possible 'healthy' BMI.  

I'll admit that I don't even feel 'good' at the low end of my range; I don't get a period and everything is boney so sitting down is basically never comfortable. 

I'm 5'8'' and about 120 pounds; my highest weight was about 130 and my lowest was 113 but my doctor says that I should be 135-145 based on my growth charts and how my family is built.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really bothers me that blind weights are becoming an FA 'thing'. 

I have anorexia, and I get blind weights because I get way too fixated on numbers and right now I am not in a good enough place to deal with the urges I get when I see that I have gained or lost.

This doesn't mean that I am in denial about my weight; I know that I am underweight and I am told if I gain or lose a meaningful amount, but not having exact numbers makes it easier for me to cope.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey y'all! I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I a camp counselor, and I'm looking for some advice before first day with my group of 5-6 year olds! I feel like I know a lot about kids in theory, but  my experience comes from working in a preschool and doing camp with older kids, so this will be a new adventure and I would love to hear parents take on this age group.

The kids have a long day; before care starts at 7 am and after care ends at 6 pm, so while I only have them for the 7 hour camp day (9 am-4 pm) so some of them are spending almost 12 hours away from home! Most of our activities are pretty structured and the schedule is consistent from day to day (they always swim at the same time every etc.) so I'm not concerned about that aspect but I'm still a bit nervous. 

I know that I'm not going to be perfect, and that nothing will really prepare me for my first day, but I'm a perfectionist and I really want to do everything I can to provide the best experience for the kids I am being trusted with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BMI works for the vast majority of people, but it isn't perfect; which is why doctors use other metrics to get a full picture of a patients health. The biggest reason that they have to use other metrics is because the 'healthy' weight range is so big; peoples optimal weights are going to be at different points in that range. 

There are also people who can be healthy at what is technically an unhealthy BMI; most doctors I have worked with aren't too concerned about a patient whose BMI is 26 if their other numbers are good and their weight stays stable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup! 

I grew up with an emotionally and verbally abusive father. I truly believe that he had good intentions, but he is very emotionally immature and probably has some unresolved issues from his own upbringing. 

For me it was all about setting boundaries and accepting that what I am going to get is not what I really want. We will never be close, I will probably always stiffen when he tries to hug me and he is probably never going to understand the damage that he did to me, and I am ok with that, because I no longer need or want his approval. 
 
I will never have a good relationship with my father, but things got SO much better when I accepted that our relationship will always be superficial, and found ways to have my emotional needs met in other ways. 

I had a therapist who told me "you can't go to the hardware store and be angry that they don't sell cake mix. they have a lot of useful things, just not what you need at that moment" and I thought that was a really good way to look at difficult relationships.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who struggles with an eating disorder the best thing that you can do it be supportive! It must be so difficult to hear that she is hurting herself but it is really important that she continues to feel comfortable talking to you, I know one of the reasons I am so secretive is because I hate having to see how upset my mom gets. 

You should really try to get her into some kind of treatment; I would talk to her guidance counselor. Even just therapy to deal with underlying issues, plus, a therapist can direct you to other resources and let you know if they think a higher level of care would be helpful. Early intervention is so important in treating eating disorders!  </TEXT>
