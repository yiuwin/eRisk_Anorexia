	<TEXT> Ah I see. I do use a volume ramp (12-14-16-18-deload). Sorry for nitpicking ;). Yes I am 130 lbs but at 5'5" and around 13-14% bodyfat, at an intermediate level.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't tell my current level of strength by my weight. Don't judge lol. I'm not an advanced trainee, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't try to educate myself on the 'hobby' I am trying to get good at. I do train hard, and I try to keep it all simple. But if there is something that I can do to improve my results by 2.5%, I will do it (if the time-investment is worth it of course). I am just trying to learn.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally prefer towel rows, you can really feel the back muscles with this exercise. Ask Mike Chang about it.

	<TEXT> 1. OK that seems a good approach to me. One mesocylce high frequency and lower volume per workout (full body workouts), and one mesocyle of upper lower splits for high volume per workout but low frequency. 


2. 12 sets is actually pretty low. That is like the minimum for most muscle groups. Look at Dr. Mike Israetel's work:

	<TEXT> Yes, I already read that article. I read everything from Stronger by Science lol. But thanks! The thing is just that almost no popular programs I see have a higher frequency that 3 times a week. Most intermediate to advanced programs are upper/lower or push/pull/legs splits, which have you train a muscle group 2 times per week.

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot, this is a really cool and helpful document. However, it does not address the question here. It just gives a range of days a week which should be effective. It says 2-4 days for chest per week. My question was, which is better, 2 or 4 days?

	<TITLE> What is better? 6 sets two times a week, or 3 sets 4 times a week? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Basically what the title says. Is it better to do 6 sets per week per bodypart two times a week or 3 sets 4 times a week for a bodypart. Both will come out to 12 sets per week, which should be just enough to elicit some hypertrophic responses. To me, it seems like it is better to do 3 sets 4 times a week, because that way you can spread fatigue over the week and keep protein synthesis elevated throughout the week.

	<TEXT> If the exercises become too easy, you can hang the rings up higher. Doing exercises on rings that are attached to a high ceiling are much harder because there is even more stabilization required. Your rings hang very low right now.  </TEXT>
