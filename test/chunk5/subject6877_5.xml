These moments could range from tries, tackles and moments of great skill. Additionally I would like to include historic moments in his career. Feel free to post them here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The club that I play for has gone up two leagues in two seasons and we are getting to the stage where we are playing teams where there a lot of contracted players. We have now got to the stage where we need to keep our very best players but we do not want to lose our roots of being an amateur side that has a strong base of local players. It appears that we have managed to get around this in 3 ways.   

1. Focus strongly on the youth side of the team. Players that have been with the club for years are more likely to come back to us and stay loyal to the club.  

2. Local companies such as bricklayers and pubs sponsor individual players and pay for their kit etc. In turn there sponsor is next to the player in the match day programme. I imagine it helps the sponsor to be seen as supporting the local team.  

3. They have now offered to pay for petrol for players to make training if they live more than 10 miles away. Additionally we get three free pints after the game if we have been constantly at training which is always an incentive!

	<TEXT> I would not be too disheartened my friend. I have read many articles stating how Japanese rugby is on the up and setting up key foundations to grow the sport. I see that the Sunwolves, despite regularly losing games are filling out there stadiums. I think sport has always had one ultimate trait. And that is that if there is there a big enough audience for a sport in a certain country, then money will be spent on that sport. Japan will be pouring a lot of money into rugby over the next decade or so and you can bet that it will pay dividends to the Japanese national teams sporting success in some way or other over the next few years.    

TL;DR: Japan will be fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just thought I would post a little post to show how grateful I am that there is a community here that is so great. I have never seen such scales of interaction like there is in this sub. I feel like there are regulars here and that really is a great thing. People don't downvote other posts because they don't agree with it, they instead put in a comment to spark debate. I came to this sub 9 months ago posting a small montage that was my first ever made and the amount of advise I was given was astounding. You don't get that in other communities. Additionally, I see a lot of other sites actually going to this sub to grab interesting information and this shows just how much activity and diversity there is here. Won't be long until we hit 50k readers and long may this community thrive!  

TL;DR: I love the community and the top lads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So many great things I can say about this guy. Last year he kept working at it while Itoje and Kruis were getting all the plaudits and he came back all the stronger. He seems to be so humble as well. At the final whistle he kept a cool head and his workrate is unbelievable. Heard a lot of murmurs that Itoje is a future England captain but I think Joe could be in with a shout in 2-3 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My two pence on the game. It was utterly enthralling and the atmosphere was sublime. The tackles in the game were ferocious and Wales pushed us so hard that at points I simply couldn't watch the game. The crowd through the stadium and Cardiff were amazing. It's a mixture of pride and intimidation which must be so intimidating for visiting teams. A great game which I will remember for a long time. </TEXT>
