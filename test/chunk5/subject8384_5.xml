Every episode of season 1 had me waiting for the next without those bells and whistles....this one has been trying too hard ... I can already see the next twist that he is in some kind of mental institution or halfway house and not actually living at his mothers house </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How Is Mysteryland (NL) compared to Tomorrowland? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-27 13:14:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So it was my first Tomorrowland and im still speechless because it was so amazing. Im thinking about going to Mysteryland in the Netherland but I have a few questions: I heard they mostly play minimal house and techno is that true? I enjoy all kinds of music but (please dont hate me) I really enjoy the mainstream "EDM" songs you can sing along or tropical house (I saw Sam Feldt is playing there). 

Also why is it ending so early at 11pm? That kinda surprised me.

Thank you! :) </TEXT>
