	<TEXT> [Linuses review](https://youtu.be/L34ZkAF9q9w) is out. He's paired the card with a i7 7700K and R7 1800X and given benchmarks against 980ti,1080, furyX and of course the titan xp. 

Looks like it's pretty good considering its near titan performance at nearly half the price.

And faster than the titan although cuts back on bandwidth and slightly on vram.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A girl, her grandma, a guy and his boss share a compartment in a train. From the beginning of the journey it's pretty obvious that the girl and guy like each other. Once when the train passes through a tunnel and plunged into darkness a kissing sound and slap is heard. When the train comes out into light, the old woman thinks, "It was daring of that guy to kiss my grandchild, but it was rightful of her to slap him". The boss thinks, "The guy is brave to try such a thing, but I wish she hadn't mistook me for him". The girl thinks "Wow the guy is a brave one, but I wish my grandma didn't have to slap him". While the guy thinks, "This has to be my luckiest day. I get to kiss a girl and slap my boss". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A penguin decides he was sick of living in the antarctic and wants to go see the world. 

So he decides he's going to drive through the Americas. Anyways he's been driving up from South America and he makes it to Arizona when he gets a flat tire. 

He finds a garage to take his car to and the owner says it'll be a little while, but there's a diner across the street if he wants to grab a bite while he waits. The penguin agrees and goes to the diner and has a a burger for lunch. The waitress asks him if he'd like to have dessert and the penguin says, " you know, I'd love an ice cream cone. 

The waitress obliges and brings the penguin a vanilla ice cream in a cone. But, being a penguin, he has trouble holding it, what with having flippers and all, and ends up making a huge mess, smearing the ice cream all over his face. At this point, the penguin gets a call from the garage saying that his car is ready. 

The penguin waddles across the street to the garage and asks the owner, "what's the damage?"

The owner says, "it looks like you blew a seal."

The penguin is mortified and exclaims, "it's only ice cream!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Linuses(Linus Tech Tips) Ryzen review](https://youtu.be/9wJQEHNYE7M) on YouTube says they couldn't POST with RAM speeds greater than 2666mhz.

Shout out to u/kerfufflator. Hoping you've read this. There's a pretty good chance nothings DOA,  instead the lack of bios update is making your system not POST with rams on higher speeds. Borrow a slower ram stick (preferably 2400mhz) and check it out. Cheers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. But their ideology spread isn't direct.  

Want higher education for cheap or free? Come to China.  

Wanna learn in China? You need to know Chinese. 

Wanna learn Chinese?  Hey take this Chinese language course, we'll sponsor you. 

A result of which many people have taken up learning Chinese, even in the US.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did. GamersNexus are worse, computerbase.de are okayish. Jokers, I've heard, are an exception to most. Someone charted the benchmarks according to processor and reviewer, they were all over the place. It's like bios weren't updated and engineering samples were handed out.  

It's mostly super amazing for video encoding, compression, etc. Craps out during gaming on fps on comparison with Intel. 

Someone said they're going to release better drivers soon. Apparently the senseMi tech isn't working well with the balanced profile in Windows. You get better results with SMT disabled and /or High performance profile in Windows. 

While overall fps are good,it's just that all 3 R7s hang around mid or bottom of most benchmarks, unless they're video encoding ones.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've seen Anandtechs benchmarks and other than the encoding ones,they are bad. Ryzen hovers around mid or lower end of the benchmarks. Mostly lower end. 

Video encoding, AES benchmarks are top notch. Others, not as much.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Benchmarks for the Ryzen R7 series have been released by trusted reviewers like Anandtech and GamersNexus and many other independent reviewers who got the media kit. 

While they look great from a content creator /media company's perspective (video encoding and related stuff is top notch),  they are terrible in games as compared to Intel (Ryzen processors are at the bottom or mid in most benchmarks) . 

Benchmarks from games like Watch Dogs 2, GTA 5 and even Battlefield 1 are far lower than expected. 

As the processors were specifically marketed to gamers and the gamer community's decision may decide the fate of Ryzens success, how will this be handled? </TEXT>
