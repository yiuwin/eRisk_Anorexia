	<TEXT> Well, I'm glad we didn't sign him then. Alexis would have been playing striker a lot more then, and that clearly doesn't work, as we've all seen (but Wenger hasn't) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think our spacing can be an issue as well. It's usually great until we get to the box. There's often 4 or 5 players clumped within 5-10 yards, usually on the left side and especially when Alexis plays striker because he tends to drift into that spot even if someone else is already there. This brings a lot of defenders close to that area. In theory we should have a free man on the other post but we can't get the ball to him because it's crowded and we can't work it through.  </TEXT>

2. He acts as if Norman chose to not cover AB. This is false, as you could tell how excited he was when covering him. Also, players don't decide themselves how the defense plays, there's a reason we have defensive coordinators. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow. That was crazy. I'm confused by Wenger's decisions, but I'm also feeling like he's a genius at the same time.  

Ospina was insane.  If Cech had started, we would have lost.

Alexis played so much better on the wing, I hope that was the last time we'll see him at striker.

Giroud confused me, not sure how I feel about him atm.

Mustafi and Koscielny both had moments of greatness and moments of stupidity.

We didn't deserve that point at all, but I'll take it.  This feels like a win. </TEXT>

Walcott

Giroud

Who can you guys see starting?


EDIT: I would love to see Cazorla in the starting lineup, but I don't think he wil have the legs after his weekend performance, hence why I put Elneny in. Santi to come on for him if we are down at around the 70th minute. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We always do this. We go into the game with a plan, which works for like 2 drives. Then when it goes to shit, we don't know what to do. When we figure it out, it ends up being too late. We need to spread the field like we did on the TD drive and focus on the pass. Penalties killed us, it's ridiculous how a center can get 2 false start penalties, just ridiculous. And our run game needs to be better. We have a bunch of huge D-Linemen who don't do anything. Obviously our defense isn't going to be great this year, so the offense has to take advantage of every opportunity we create.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I know I'm just saying his ADP should be closer to the likes of Bortles, Rivers, and Manning. Not saying he should go like 50th or anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I'm biased but I think Cousins' ADP is ridiculously low. I predict him to be the 5th best QB this season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's not going to strictly be a game manager, just more of one than he was last year.  He had more garbage time points than any QB last year, the whole reason he finished in the top 5 QB's.  Jacksonville's defense has gotten so much better, and they won't be down nearly as much as they were last year.  While Jacksonville improves, Bortles declines in a fantasy sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. Bortles will be much more of a game manager this season.  Langford is a lone back in Chicago, while Rawls might end up splitting carries with CMike.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes.  Thomas's production will be much lower than past seasons this year, and Bernard will have to split carries. </TEXT>

Was looking to improve my RB2, planning on packaging Hyde and either Baldwin or Fitz.  Who should I be targeting?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually try to because a lot of guys in my league like to horde QB's for some reason (there's like 3 or 4 teams with 3, don't ask me why).  This limits the quality of available QB's on waivers (Tannehill is the best as of right now). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, he'll probably take over for Garcon.  He's a big receiver (6'4, 190) with decent speed (4.43 40 time).  A lot of analysts are saying he's the best receiver in this draft class.  Drawing comparisons to A.J. Green.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although our line is looking pretty good (aside from Licht) I'm very skeptical.  Kelley has shown promise thus far, however he hasn't been playing against starting defenses a whole lot.  Thompson is bound to get injured at some point as well.  I'd really like us to go after a free agent, preferably Forsett if he doesn't resign with the Ravens.  And of course there's always Pierre Thomas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2012 Week 17 when we beat Dallas at home to clinch the NFC East. One of my favorite moments.

2015 Week 16 when we clinched the division in Philly. Loved it when DJax shushed all the Philly fans. </TEXT>
