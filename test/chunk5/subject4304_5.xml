	<TEXT> Religion has fucked up a lot in this world. For that reason, I do not subscribe to any one religion or denomination. I worship God under christianity because that is the closest to my beliefs.

I would not consider myself religious. I have faith. They're two seperate things. The word *religion* carries too many horrible conotations that I want no part of, and is not and never was part of God's vision for this planet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everything happens for a reason. 

Please see here - (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcUS09pi2PE) for an explanation as to why there is suffering in the World.

Another thing that provides a plausible explanation - http://www.explorefaith.org/world.html

As for why God allows people to suffer and die when he's helping someone achieve a gold medal, well, God is omnipotent, infinite in a way that it is impossible for us to even comprehend. He can multitask. 

As for how God works, he presents opportunity. He won't lay something out with bells and whistles for you, with an instruction booklet to boot. A story that puts this well is this one - http://epistle.us/inspiration/godwillsaveme.html 

A terrible storm came into a town and local officials sent out an emergency warning that the riverbanks would soon overflow and flood the nearby homes. They ordered everyone in the town to evacuate immediately.

A faithful Christian man heard the warning and decided to stay, saying to himself, I will trust God and if I am in danger, then God will send a divine miracle to save me.

The neighbors came by his house and said to him, Were leaving and there is room for you in our car, please come with us! But the man declined. I have faith that God will save me.

As the man stood on his porch watching the water rise up the steps, a man in a canoe paddled by and called to him, Hurry and come into my canoe, the waters are rising quickly! But the man again said, No thanks, God will save me.

The floodwaters rose higher pouring water into his living room and the man had to retreat to the second floor. A police motorboat came by and saw him at the window. We will come up and rescue you! they shouted. But the man refused, waving them off saying, Use your time to save someone else! I have faith that God will save me!

The flood waters rose higher and higher and the man had to climb up to his rooftop.

A helicopter spotted him and dropped a rope ladder. A rescue officer came down the ladder and pleaded with the man, "Grab my hand and I will pull you up!" But the man STILL refused, folding his arms tightly to his body. No thank you! God will save me!

Shortly after, the house broke up and the floodwaters swept the man away and he drowned.

When in Heaven, the man stood before God and asked, I put all of my faith in You. Why didnt You come and save me?

And God said, Son, I sent you a warning. I sent you a car. I sent you a canoe. I sent you a motorboat. I sent you a helicopter. What more were you looking for?

I am not trying to change your mind. You posed questions and I am merely answering them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing about the creation story is that God would have had to put into words that the people of the time could understand.

The fact that we have had the evidence presented to us as a species and the intellect to interpret it as we have shows that this was always God's intention, to present evidence in such a way that we could form a plausible explanation for it, which is exactly what the brain does, creates explanations for evidence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't deny that the gospels have been edited. Heavily. We have the catholic church to blame for that.

As for the existence of Jesus, the Roman historian Tacitus, who was and still is highly reputable, showed in many of his texts and writings. Unfortunately, like many contemporary roman historians, he neglected to provide a source. 

Please see other evidence here - http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/did-jesus-exist/

	<TEXT> I do see where you are coming from. This is where belief comes in.

we have scientific and historical evidence that directly contradicts the story that is told in the Bible

But that is the thing. The bible is a highly accurate historical document, and analysis of roman records show this. Of course, one has to analyse the Bible as a historical source, in both cases. Unless you are just making an example. Historical records show, fairly explicitly, that the was a man named Jesus of Nazareth, who lived between 50BC and 100AD. That man has had a profound effect on the world. That is indisputable. </TEXT>

Part of being a christian is belief and faith. Faith is belief. Belief in something that can neither be proven nor disproven. Evolution is not a belief, in my eyes. Evolution is not a belief because of the substantial evidence behind it. The only evidence behind God is my own experience and the anecdotal evidence of others which is why  it requires belief. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jesus man, this hurts.

My godmother died last month of a malignant brain tumour. We were close. Very close.

I'd like nothing more than to spend another hour with her. A chance to say goodbye and apologize, again, for all the times I shirked emailing her or made up an excuse for not ringing her, just for a chat, nothing more.

But if I told her the situation of how I was able to talk to her, she would probably tell me off for not taking the other option. Because that billion dollars could do so much for the other people in the world who are suffering. She would tell me off for being selfish and not putting other people ahead of myself, because that is what she taught me. That is what she taught me so many times, that you should always think of the other guy and try to work out how this can benefit more than just yourself.

This has actually been rather therapeutic. I'm glad I came across this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AotC had a lot of potential. I enjoy the politics and the moral dilemma within the film. It suffers from the focus being in the wrong place when they should really be Obi Wan's films. 

Unfortunately, the script we got wasn't fantastic. Scenes that added crucial development were cut, which made crucial characters seem empty and underdeveloped.

A similar thing can be said for TPM. There is insufficient character development between Kenobi and Qui Gon, while fan service is overpowering and comic relief completely inappropriate. It just didn't feel like star wars.

That said, these are the ramblings of someone who has watched the prequels several times and made these judgements as a result of that. That being said, the first time I watched TPM, I was 8 and I thought it was the best thing ever. Obviously, I've grown up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Simon Scarrow's Jack Tanner novels. Absolutely brilliant. A real man's book, with gritty fight scenes and fast paced action. It's like Sharpe but world war II.

And anything by Bernard Cornwall. Agincourt is fantastic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Currently staying in a villa in Kaparis. The beach is literally down the road, a gorgeous bakery not far away and several exquisite restaurants just up the road from us.

My recommendation would be to rent a car so you have freedom of movement. Buses are utter shite and not much is walking distance. You also don't want to be within the confines of a hotel all day long.

Several of the harbours and marinas are host to day cruises which usually take you far enough up the coast to see Famagusta.

Where are you flying into?

This is perfect if you land at Larnaca, if you land at Paphos you've got a bit of an issue on your hands. </TEXT>

Within a platoon, a platoon sergeant is second in command to the lieutenant. Within a company, the company sergeant major is the senior soldier. There are then some regimental sergeant majors above him but are still part of the regiment.

	<TEXT> Ok. Cyprus.

1. Zenobia. Hands down. Google it. You'll read all you need to know.
2. Liberty and Nemesis. Two old ships sunk as artificial reefs. About 30m to the seafloor so it's a nice dive for newly qualified advanced open water divers.
3. Konnos Bay. A nice little shore dive where you can go deep. Really deep. Tech dives come here simply for training and it's great for other divers who just want to go deep.
4. Green Bay. People end up doing this dive site a lot. It's a prime DSD location because it is so enclosed. There's quite a few statues that have been left down there and there are a few turtles who pay a visit occasionally. </TEXT>

It is often needed for one to do a DSD beforehand so that you know what you are getting yourself into.

Some people might find the whole thing claustrophobic, disorienting or be unable to clear her ears. That's what the DSD is for. To ensure that you are happy with the conditions in order to move forward. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The loss of Crete in 1941 was a military disaster that never should have happened. The core German invasion force consisted of fallschirmjager armed with submachine guns who were both outgunned and outnumbered by the British defenders. The British defeat is largely blamed on the incompetent leadership of Major-General Freyberg.

What if the Germans had been forced back? What if the British defenders had a decent leader who knew what he was doing?How does this affect the progression of the war? How does it affect the war in North Africa? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ensuring that pupils get a well-rounded education is what the national curriculum is for. If schools do not teach what the national curriculum tells them to then Ofsted will deal with them accordingly.

As for the claim that Faith schools are simply well established schools in middle class areas, my school certainly wasn't in a middle class dominant area, yet it still achieved excellent exam results and had a very low staff turnover rate.

Edit: as for removing the faith aspect would keep the academic success the same, it would not. The fact that it is a Christian school attracts many teachers who have worked the Christian ethos into their way of working, making the teaching better.

On top of that, the pastoral support offered by a chaplain or faith representative is largely irreplaceable due to the Christian background of their care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mr Deputy Speaker,

This bill would have my full support if not for the inclusion of the abolition of faith schools.

I have attended two faith schools and I believe that the Christian ethos of both has made me an infinitely better person.

On top of that, Faith schools consistently get better results and are highly sought after to get children into.

Why fix something that isn't broken?
