	<TEXT> I'm curious about the stuff you and similar youtubers review! Do you buy most for company money or so you get lot's of stuff from companies to review? Can you keep the stuff after the review is done? Can you ask companies to send you stuff? What's the biggest difference when it comes to acquire stuff to review between being a new YouTube channel that no-one's heard of, and how well known you are now?
And will you come to Sweden? :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some quick tips while am at it:
-Use parallel quarter-chords (probably called something else, basically 2 fourths stacked EAD e.g.) and play any preferred major pentatonic over it. 

-Play blues scale and then venture out to play the chord-tones of the augmented fourth in the key you are in (A+ in E-blues)

-Play major pentatonic on major seven chords, one note above the root, this will give you the 13 colour naturally in the licks (D-pentatonic during Cmaj7)

-While soloing on sustained chords that hold for quite a while, switch scales, modes and keys on top of it (play for example E-blues, A-blues, D-Major scale, whole tone scale, diminished scale, E Phrygian back to E-blues over a sustained E- Chord (E minor))

-Play all the "wrong" notes. 

-Purchase Vincent Persichettis "Twentieth  Century Harmony"

	<TEXT> Well, I don't play in very high ranks, bet I'm usually D.Va and we very seldom also have an Ana and it works quite well, D.Va uses her defence matrix when Reinhardts sheild is down and keeps quite close to the rest of the team most of the time. Mercy or even Lucio is quite enough healing in tighter spaces where you can dive back and get a healthpack if needed, which it is (and that would say that Sombra counters an Ana-less comp with D.va)? </TEXT>

If so? What would you do with your power? Lot's of rich persons would do anything to have their wealth back, and no one would hurt you because if you died, the world would become anarchy. 

Pls answer the second part of the question even if you wouldn't trade your son. :)

	<TEXT> In roman numeral analysis you use the scale steps as a basis. In "funktionsanys" which the best translation for, but does not exactly mean "diatonic functional analysis" you don't care about the steps at all but only the harmonic function of the chord. 

For example, C Am Dm7 G7 would be written T Tp Sp7 D7 (TONIC TONICparallel 
SUBDOMINANTparallel7 DOMINANT7)

If we had C Am F# G7 that would be T Tp D~~D~~7b9 D7

D~~D~~7b9 is a D7b9(chord) without the D

EDIT: clarifying stuff </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And I'm just wondering how you analyse everything in major? Don't you want to point out the dominant~ness of for example A7 when it's leading to Dm in a song played in D dorian, or am I missing something?

EDIT: Well I guess that was a bad example because of A7 not being native to D dorian, but let's change it to D harmonic minor and use the same example! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Love this ^ because i don't know what the "common practise period" is, and that means I can learn something new! I'm however Swedish and not used to English terminology. :)
When I go to the Swedish and English Wikipedia pages for the "kyrkotonarter" and "gregorian mode" they actually talk about a bit different stuff, so I fear that we may misunderstand each other. 

However I at least thought that the scale we where actually talking about was the DEFGABCD. 
And if I was going to make a roman numeral analysis (which I wouldn't because I much prefer Diatonic Functional Analysis (just called "Functional Analysis in Swedish)) I would talk about every triad containing only scale steps like I was talking about for example a natural A minor scale. This means that the vi chord would be BDF and not BbDF like if it was a natural D minor scale. 
I fear however I may be missing your point and if you would be so kind and have the time, please try and explain for me! :)

Merry Christmas! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wtf are you talking about, the modes aka gregorian modes was mostly used in the middle ages and idk where you studied music theory, but it's definitely a "basic part of traditional music theory" and one should definitely analyse dorian as dorian and not something else (well should and should, but I don't see why not).  </TEXT>
