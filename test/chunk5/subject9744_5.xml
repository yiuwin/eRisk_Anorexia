	<TITLE> Disneyland Crowd Discussion </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-01 19:48:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is something that really bothered me when I went to the parks in December. Disney really needs to do something about their crowds. There are some things that I wish Disney could do better while managing the massive amount of people in their parks. Here are some of my suggestions.

1. No parades! The absolute worst thing is when you're trying to get somewhere with the already terrible crowds and then suddenly a parade starts. Its impossible to get across Main Street and it overall is just a mess. I understand parades are "part of the magic" but It could actually be dangerous if someone had a gun or something.

2. Park Limits. The parks need to have lower crowd limits. I feel that if you can't walk 5 feet without bumping into someone, the park is too crowded. As I said before, not only does it ruin the experience, it could potentially be dangerous.

3. Ticket prices. This is pretty controversial, but I feel that Disney should up their ticket prices. It reduces the crowds and makes them more money in the process. I understand some people wouldn't be able to afford it, but that is kind of the point.

I really miss being able to walk around freely without loosing your party. Now it goes from barely manageable to completely unbearable. What do you think Disney could do to fix their crowds?

Edit: For everyone saing "they wouldn't have a gun. that's what security is for" I understand but that was not the main point. If anything dangerous were to happen it would be very very difficult to get out. Even if they opened backstage it would be a complete mad house. The gun was just an example. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a bit late but I really want to get this back. I was in the parks about 3 weeks ago and I lost my lanyard in DCA. I went to lost and found and they hadn't found anything. I highly doubt whoever took it is on this subreddit but I still want to ask. It is a wide 50th anniversary lanyard. It has many pins one of which being a limited edition diamond celebration pin. There's a limited edition dumbo pin and a Disney character stretching room pin. That's all I can really remember. Contact me if you or someone you know has it. Thanks! </TEXT>
