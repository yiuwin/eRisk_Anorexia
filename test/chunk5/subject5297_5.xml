	<TEXT> Wafford is going to be a handfull for any team in the future. He's quick, strong, and nimble. He's going to be a major factor going forward. The Bronco D constantly over pursued plays and were out of postion throughout the reason. But some how the opposing team (including the Raiders) would  bail them out. The Raiders should of beat them twice. Case in point where Cooper beats Roby and Ward goes for the big hit and Cooper rolls for another 10 yards. The Broncos have holes on D and the Raiders have the weapons to expose them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He basically had to hold or that was going to be a touchdown. The middle was wide open. I wonder if they saw that and attacked it again on the throw to Roberts </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ouch! That dude has been a warrior for us.  That guy bleeds silver and black. You probably don't appreciate guys like wheatly, Kaufman, and fargus either. He could of left whenever he wanted but stayed bc he's a raider.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I knew our draft was better than the donkeys. I really like this numerical approach to analyzing a draft class. I was going to start pulling hair out if I had to read another lazy draft analysis that graded us lower bc we didn't draft a true MLB. </TEXT>
