	<TEXT> Actually, if you read the text, it says "you are able to capture every legendary pokemon." If you also watch the video this is shown it, the announcer explicitly says "if you have either Alpha Sapphire or Omega Ruby, you can encounter all legendaries." No need to jump to conclusions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> iirc, Justice has the same system where they don't credit the singers or collaborators on their records. It has to do with the idea that they want these people to be a part of Justice, and that they weren't just tacked on for a song or two.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the line of theories, I personally think the plot revolves around the morality of government, racism/human warfare, and humanity losing it's title of "top of the food chain." The idea of livestock is interesting, but considering real world factors, the main problems are that 1. People control their livestock extremely well 2. We are the ones that contain the livestock, not the livestock defending themselves, and 3. Livestock does not come back to fight and kill us.    </TEXT>
