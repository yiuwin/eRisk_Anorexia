	<DATE> 2016-11-17 10:16:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ROH announced the contract signings of Marty Scurll and Will Ospreay. Wed reported both a long time back, but the delay was likely due to them having to get the visas taken care of. They were described as exclusive deals, but that was just for the U.S. market. Ospreay will continue to work New Japan as his main outlet and work here when he isnt booked on tours. New Japan wanted Ospreay to work for ROH in the U.S. since the two sides work together well on dates, once it became clear Ospreay was in demand by Evolve and other groups as well. Scurll signed what I believe was a one-year deal, but both sides were said to have an escape clause at the six month mark. The deals will allow both to work in the U.K., although both will probably be working a lot less there, and they can still work PWG </TEXT>
