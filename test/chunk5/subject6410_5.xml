	<TEXT> Thats possible but i dont think its practical.

I mean the Emperor should be seen as invincible. It would be embarrasing if he had to go around and say "oh, dont worry about my scars, that was coz some terrorist electro-shocked me" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Np.
If he is to appear in Rogue One, i would want him to be addressing the senate in his disguise so we can see how the rest of the galaxy saw him.

Frankly, i find it hard to believe that so many Imperials would be so loyal to an obviously dark, mysterious and evil looking man. Such an image would run counter productive to the Empire's propaganda. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, i thought the First Order and its prominent members are kinda noob at being evil. Ben Mendelson's Imperial [insert title here] character on the other hand looks menacing. I hope that he gives the rebels the hardest time acquiring the death star plans.

Ps. i think the Rebels suffering some big defeat prior to the battle of Yavin will make their eventual victory even more meaningful </TEXT>

I reckon they should introduce some different types of planets. Maybe Mon Calamari (water world) or Dromund kass (Dark evil planet) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. This is Star Wars not Game of Thrones. How could they just kill of the main character? It would mean that  Rey was just to meant to be a postal girl to Luke Skywalker and nothing more. That seems very unlikely to me.

	<TEXT> 98% of it has been scratched. That includes the other novels post ROTJ that you mention.

Bits and pieces have been re-introduced into canon. But no Thrawn, Jade, Katarn, Jacen, Jaina, Lowbacca or Rendar. There have been a few threads on this that list them. Do a little bit of browsing to find them

Small things like some planets, ship types, locations and bits of Jedi lore etc have been re-introduced. Mainly in the Rebels TV series and in the games released to date </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 3 categories of movie to choose from:

* Episodic (so basically episode 8)
* Non-episodic, spinoff 
* Re-do of Episode 7. In this case, note that you are constrained by the ages of actors/actresses so specify a release date for a movie if it is to have occured soon after ROTJ

curious to see what you guys say </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know. especially if you did what a lot of ppl did after they watched TFA and compare it to the EU.

If the EU never occured, then i bet you 100% Episode 7 would have been called "Rise of the New Jedi Order" or something. But Disney wants to leave their mark on the story so they will do the opposite of the EU and in order to appease the fans of the EU, occasionally bring in the odd planet, spaceship or event into canon </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dont think all the Jedi are dead again. They may just "appear" to all be dead in the same way they "appeared" to all be dead after Order 66. 

First things first, we dont have any books, movies or tv series that deal with the period between the battle of Jakku and the time of TFA. We have few details of what really happened in that time. All we know is that by the time of TFA, most people have forgotten about the Jedi.

Lets say that Luke started a Jedi Academy on everyone's favourite moon Yavin 4. and trained around 10-15 students. He probably did so in relative secrecy so as to not garner the attention of powerful individuals in the galaxy (Evil or Good) and to keep them away from galactic politics until the time was right.

Then at some point, Kylo Ren comes along with Snoke and the Knights of Ren and slaughters most of the students at Luke's academy. I dont think they could have all died. If Luke was able to get away, surely others did also. 

Furthermore, if Disney wants to drag this franchise out as much as possible, they are gonna want to introduce some more Jedi characters because a fair amount of fans take a huge interest and a prepared to pay a lot of money for Jedi related material. Eg Force Unleashed, TOR, Jedi Outcast, Dark Forces etc etc etc.
