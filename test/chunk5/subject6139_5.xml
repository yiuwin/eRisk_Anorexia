	<TEXT> That wasn't the style he was playing....
He came up with some of the greatest songs and riffs in history? 
I think he took plenty of risks 
His signature sloppy style was a risk he took
He was sloppy at least mostly on purpose, I'll admit some of it was the drugs, but if you've ever heard jimmy playing when he was a teenager or in any other style you would know he wasn't sloppy completely on accident. 
Their music had the feeling that it could fall apart at any moment, but they kept it on the edge. 
It was exciting, different, and risk taking for the time that THEY were making music. 
I hate when people forget that if the legends didn't make the music that they did, music wouldn't have evolved the way it did, and your "imaginative, risk taking music" might not be around.
SRV covered tons of jimi and made it his own, does that make him unoriginal and "just a good guitarist"?

	<TEXT> I got mad at my fianc tonight for basically no reason/: had a huge anxiety attack and made her cry because she felt bad for "hurting my feelings"
I asked her if she wanted to cuddle and she said she was comfy (she was half asleep and not really meaning any harm) but, because of how an ex used to treat me at the end of our relationship, I thought she didn't want me to touch her and I got upset and embarrassed/: 
I felt like I was being a nuisance and ruining things 
I know she will get used to my anxiety eventually I just don't want to hurt her right now 
Sometimes I just feel like if I didn't have anxiety all of my problems would be fixed, I would hurt the ones I love as much, and I would have achieved so much more in life 
Ya know? 

Sorry if this was hard to follow I just needed to get it out...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problems! 
Meditation is as simple as closing your eyes, taking 5-7 deep breaths and focusing on an imaginary object (I normally imagine a ball) and focus only on that. 
People portray meditation as some hard thing that takes years to perfect, but the kind of medication that can help people like us is simple as 123, your just focusing on something to clear your mind and equalize yourself. Some people imagine a happy place or memory, it can literally be anything as long as you focus only on it. 
Meditation can become more advanced and if it is something you like you can then do some research online for various techniques and "mind exercises" 
I am much more at peace after starting meditation </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly
I love talking to someone else with anxiety, they understand and are really sympathetic most of the time. People without it that are close to me, like my brother, try to understand, but they've never experienced it so there is no way that they can understand like someone who has, and they don't get that I can't just shrug it off and "just don't think about it" doesn't work.  </TEXT>

It feels better just to know someone else understands! 
I practice various meditation techniques that have helped me tremendously. 
I would do some research into that, you may feel silly at first, but once you realize that you feeling silly is just your anxiety acting, you can really block everything else out and equalize yourself. It is truly a peaceful way to start your day. Even when you don't feel anxious, it can be preventative to start the day in a clear mindset. 
I hope you start to feel better and if you ever need to talk you can message me anytime! I understand frustration because of anxiety all too well  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does anyone feel like their anxiety has stages, or levels, of severity? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-26 18:39:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been suffering from panic attacks since I was very young (like 5-7 years old). It has always been such a huge part of my life, and I always tried to hide from it, like if I didn't talk about it it would go away. The first purpose of this post is to say thank you to everyone on this sub. 
I just recently discovered this place and it is so awesome to see a community band together like this! 
Reading some of your posts have helped me feel less like a sociopath because I have seen several people describing the way anxiety feels, the thoughts it gives you, and some of the physical symptoms, and I feel/have the majority of the symptoms I've read.
It really helps to know I'm not alone. 
Which brings me to the real purpose of the post: 
My therapist and I have determined my panic attacks have stages or levels.  
Explanation: 
Level 1- tight chest, a little shaky, sweaty, brain running a mile a minute, trouble focusing, generally quiet. (I can normally do several thought exercises to stop a panic attack at this level)
Level 2-intense anger at myself for feeling the way I do. It often gets taken out on others. Adrenaline takes over a little, and I have hurt myself before. (Some one I trust, normally my fianc or my mom, can usually talk me down from this stage. Listening to peaceful music also helps.)
Level 3- extreme sadness, I have several ticks and twitches that are caused by anxiety that become magnified at this level, I shake extremely bad, my stutter from when I was younger comes back to the point that I can't even speak a sentence over 4 words, and that is still pushing it. 
(The only way I can escape from this level is being alone or being held by my fianc until it passes[2-4 hours]) 
Level 4- I shut down completely, curl into a ball and stare into nothing. I don't want to eat, sleep, shower, talk, or do anything at all. I can't bring myself to talk for fear of how I sound, or what I might say. The shaking and twitching continue without me trying to control it. (These are the worst and I have only had a few hand-full of them but they can sometimes last for days at a time, the only way to get me back is to let it pass or give me a Xanax and let me pass out. Only problem with that is that I hate the way medicine makes me feel.) 

I just wanted to know if anybody else had some of the same experiences as me, or felt like their anxiety had levels with different symptoms. Please comment and tell me if anyone is out there... I've been feeling more and more like a sociopath lately /: </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great song! 
I do have some questions about 7 and 8 string guitars 
Do you usually only use the bottom four strings during a song? (Legitimate question)
For different songs do you only use certain sections of the strings and neck? I've never even touched a 7 or 8 string so I really don't understand the logistics of playing one. 
I can certainly see how it would help rhythm parts, I couldn't tell if you had a bass part or not but either way I don't think you would need one Hahahaha
Just curious 
Great rhythm playing, very tight  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude I absolutely fucking dig the shit out out of that rhythm riff that you started at about 0:58. 
I can tell you have a really strong sense of rhythm and how to transition between shredding some melodic tapping madness into that gnarly rhythm part to really give a feeling of suspense/relief. 
All in all pretty dope song man
Hearing it without vocals really makes me want to put something there as a singer and as a singer/guitarist, if I hear a guitar part that I automatically hear something lyrically, I know it's a bad ass hit worthy song. 
Great playing

It's not a hard progression to transfer to any key that fits your voice (I normally play f#m f#m D E)

The lead part isn't terribly hard to figure out and manipulate to make it fit your genre! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I woke up this morning and decided I wanted to buy a guitar so I headed to the store... 
I decided I was going to buy a guitar strictly based on sound/feel rather than looks like normal, i guess that worked out for me because I ended up finding a beautiful guitar that sounds and feels perfect. 
Here she is, my Valerie:

I know it's a 2012 and its Indonesian but that's all I know

	<TEXT> Awesome! 
They had a fender deluxe reverb in the shop that was right at the price point that the jet city was, the clean tone from the fender was amazing, but the dirty sound I'm looking for wasn't there. 
Does the fender handle pedal well? 
If so should I just go with the fender and use my od pedal, or get the jet city?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for the info! 
You answered pretty much all of my questions in one response!
I thought that the lead tone was killer as well, it actually the thing that turned my head. I started playing through the clean channel and wasn't very impressed (although it is leaps and bounds better than the amp I have now) but as soon as I switched to the dirty tone I couldn't stop playing it hahaha. 
What kind of music do you play if you don't mind me asking? </TEXT>
