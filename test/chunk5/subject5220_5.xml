	<TEXT> I live near the ruins of Guys Cliffe house (Midlands, UK). There was apparently a church at this location since around 800 AD, being converted into a house several hundred years later. During the crusades, Sir Guy, the owner of the house, left his wife to go and fight for the king abroad. Several years later, heavily traumatised by the horrors of war, he returned home. So traumatisd, legend has it, on returning home he could not face his wife, instead he took residence in a cave near the family home (Guys Cliffe house being built with its back against a sizable cliff). Several years he lived as a hermit in this cave, doubtless looking more and more disheveled. One day, his wife, as yet unawares of her husbands return, found out it was he living in the cave. Stricken with grief, she did hurl herself from the top of the house, dying within sight of her husbands cave.

 For a whle, the place was owned by the freemasons, now I don't know. The old ruins are very atmospheric though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I'm intrigued! The pedant in me questions the ellipse after deja vu; I read that section as one sentence, but it reads better (for me) as two distinct sentences. 

Also, you explain the expression is pronounced as 'Sa Su Ga', and then shorten it to sasuga; perhaps use the latter spelling\letter spacing the first time; it adds a bit more coherence that way, and both read the same anyway.

	<TEXT> Well, the island is a fascinating place generally! Although I didn't visit the other distillery on the island (Scapa), - I did try Scapa ale though, which was gorgeous.  I did have a wander around and visit a few museums to find out a bit more of the history of the place. 

Kirkwall is actually nearer to Bergen, Norway, than it is to London. Over it's history, Orkney has had a close association with Scandinavia. Scapa is Norse (I believe) for 'narrow inlet', describing one of the inlets leading to the island. 

As expected, it was wet and windy the whole time we were there (3 days), though this type of environment has its own effect on the flavour of the whisky produced - the smaller plants, such as heather, survive more readily, and these make their way into the peat, imparting flavours to both filtered water, and in the then burnt peat, and from there into the whisky. 

The people there have a wonderful accent too; quite different from mainland Scotland; it's almost sing song.

	<TEXT> The 40 was outstanding, naturally. HP is one of the favourite distillerys anyway, so I was expecting it to be so good. Really, though, the main difference as we progressed through the ages, was when the taste hit. With the older ones (18 and 40 particularly), the taste just seemed to linger for a lot longer. 

It (the 40) really was a smooth drink (I can't be more descriptive as this was 6 months ago now). Not sure I'd say it was worth the bottle prices of around 900, but glad I tried it. 

On a cost to taste basis, though, I think the 18 would be best value.

The Thor was certainly a bit punchier than the 40yo; I think it comes in at cask strength, which helps. I must have liked it as I bought a bottle back with me, though don't plan on opening it for a while yet.  </TEXT>

For comparison, the 40yo was going in the local pub for 55 a measure! But this was by far the most expensive of the bunch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thought /r/scotch might like to see the inside of the Highland Park tasting room. 

I was there earlier this year for a joint birthday celebration with my partners dad - that's me and him in the tasting room. As part of the tasting we got to try the HP 40 yo, which was really the highlight of the trip. 

Was a fascinating experience all round (My first trip to a distillery), so it was great to hear first hand about the whole process, and why the island whiskies have the distinctive heather and peaty tastes - it's party to do with the windswept nature of the islands making it difficult for trees to grow on them. This in turn impacts the nature and substance of the peat bogs which grow to be more heather oriented. This in turn imparts the distinctive heathery taste into the HP and similar malts.

	<TEXT> Yep, definitely do an ambient occlusion pass. Preferably render different passes seperately and then composite in Photoshop or similar after for greater control. 

Read up on key lights, back lights etc. Work out what mood you're trying to convey with the piece too. Do you want harsh, electric lighting with a sharp cut off, or (more likely) gentler lighting? Don't just settle for pure white light; it's unrealistic - just gentle tints can help, both inlighting and in shadows.  </TEXT>
