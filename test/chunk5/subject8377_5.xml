	<TEXT> As an Asian I will say you are half right. It's not because we want to be white, it's that we want to be considered on the same level as white people. Dating them seems like a good way for some to feel that they are accepted, to feel validated because our society revolves around only white people being princes and heroes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Surveys show what someone thinks they will do, not what someone actually does. There's a reason surveys shouldn't go on to be published as something we can draw inferences from, but rather a springboard for proper experimental research (say, measure who people swipe for on Tinder). 

Also it's a bit rich that you're saying this, especially since you aren't Asian and can't talk on our behalf. I hardly think it's excessive, no where near as excessive as the 'HOW TO CLEAN MY ANUS AND BOTTOM' posts which really are a google search away. The question asked by Asians IMO is far more appropriate for a forum with opinions than a butthole cleansing tutorial </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just because people generally prefer masculine men, it doesn't mean they will say no to a more feminine one. I mean, femme guys could come at a close second for some. Or if they HAD to choose it would be the more masculine one. Surveys only show someone's ideal choice not their actual choice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a thing called dysphoria, and trans people experience it even when they have transitioned. Basically, say an MtF decides to wear pants, she can experience negative feelings towards her gender identity because it reminds her of not being 'a real woman' - essentially taking on those gender stereotypes is a way to cope, in other words it is essentially over compensation by exaggerating traits we as a society have 'defined' as feminine or what a woman should have. A lot of therapy for trans people is about breaking down this dysphoria so that they can feel comfortable as a woman, recognise that they are real women without the need to wear pink every day and watch Housewives of Beverly Hills, and really come to terms with BEING a woman and not so hung up on whether or not they are 'woman enough'.

Unless our society changes and welcomes trans people rather than classifying them as fake, deceitful and not real women, they will continue to behave insecurely and rely on stereotypes which society perceives womanhood to be. Regardless, I have trans friends who do not fall into the stereotype trap, I even have a few who are trans yet identify as gender neutral - what it all relies on is their ability to be comfortable and confident in who they are and how they feel they can self express. And for that they needed a strong support unit </TEXT>

Chances are you may be reading too much into it, but you can always tell a therapist that you don't like talking about something because it makes you feel uncomfortable. You need to tell them this, they can't read your mind, but only assess you based on what you give them. If you don't want to talk about something - don't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our definition of pedophilia has changed a lot over the past century. A lot of people today would call Edgar Allan Poe a pedophile for marrying a 14 year old, but that was not at all unheard of at the time and relatively common. Hell, they became spinsters at 25 and were approaching old maid territory at 30. Girls married young because they were at their most fertile and were a liability to families. This was not considered to be pedophilia. 

Homosexuality however was criminal in a Victorian times, and was treated as such after the first and Second World War because the population was threatened. Anyone who didn't have more than one child was also looked at with suspicion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Portrait tattoos pretty much never do a person justice. Let him know that over time that tattoo is going to look less like his sister. All of that shading is going blur and the outlines are going to bleed, the tattoo is going to look bloated. Have him take a look at fresh vs healed portrait tattoos. A lot of people who want portraits are only looking at fresh examples, not the healed aftermath they will wear forever. 

Imo her name and dates or something commemorative of her like her hobbies, favourite animal or an inside joke they had would make for a much nicer tattoo that not only has a positive story behind it, but also won't be an expensive mess. Because no one wants to regret a tattoo of a loved one, but chances are you will because it will never live up to expectations  </TEXT>

It honestly wasn't that bad. Lots and lots of silicone lube. It was easiest for me to sit on one guy's dick, and then sort of lay back against him and the other guy push in missionary, but it was uncomfortable to fuck, more comfortable when we all lay on our sides. 

Keep in mind, you won't be able to give a deep fuck most likely. And shallow thrusts worked best. 

In terms of pain etc. Eh. Not really. I didn't bleed after or anything, didn't prolapse either, but I did feel tender for almost a week. I 'prepped' with a really hung guy before them, also using almost an entire bottle of lube helped a shit tonne.   </TEXT>

As a gay man, I find it easier to communicate with others because I'm already getting flack for not being a 'real man', but fuck, telling straight men to just get help for psychological reasons or to tell someone how they feel is like pulling teeth. No wonder the majority of cis men are assholes - society reinforces it and then you get situations like this where a guy just uses a woman rather than breaking it off or having a proper discussion.

	<TEXT> I've only ever had threesomes without my partner and I don't think I have the capacity to have one with my partner. I'll just steal him, lol. 

If you have great communication, then I really don't see the problem. My husband and I occasionally will open up the relationship, but either one of us can close it up whenever we want to and neither of us feel bad or upset if it happens. Of course, when we first did it, it was pretty scary and we were really anxious, but it wasn't too bad. I think in ways it brought us closer as a couple. Just keep in mind, that if it does go not so great for either one of you, to not take it personally - that it was a one time thing and you can both just move away from it. If you both end up liking it, well just keep up with the communication - let each other know your feelings about the other person and about being sexual with another person. Keep both an open mind and an open dialogue whilst also respecting each other by asking for their thoughts on the situation/person.

	<TEXT> There are different kinds of therapists. Counsellors are not adequately trained for managing and overcoming mental illness, they exist to help with day to day struggle, and for lending an ear, but cannot diagnose and treat. Psychiatrists prescribe medications and medicate based on your symptoms and often based on the diagnoses of a psychologist. Whilst they can diagnose mental illness, they are not the point and call for receiving therapy and for weeding out all the issues you have. A psychologist, and even a well trained mental health nurse, works to diagnose and treat mental illness - while they can perform the same tasks as a counsellor, their main job is to put you through some sort of treatment program whether it be IPT, ACT or CBT and work more closely with your illness and less with your personal problems although those will be discussed as factors that could impair. 

I can say from experience, psychologists only ask about your life and opinions to build rapport. They are much more interested in the fact that you have a mental illness and want to talk about overcoming it with strategies etc, whilst also learning what barriers may be in place that prevents the therapy from working so you can try to break those down. In Australia at least, there is shift to move away from information like why you have the mental illness because studies have shown that while talking about why you have the disorder can be cathartic, it doesn't generally improve the efficacy of the therapy. 

Personally, I hated counsellors. But they are the most affordable and easy to get appointments with. However, if you are dealing with a mental illness, you should be seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist, not a counsellor. Counsellors are not adequately trained to deal with mental illness, but to recognise it so they can refer them on or to give advice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. The switch you mentioned is what I tried to explain, but the common explanation is a sliding scale that is used when talking about the interactions of genetics and nurture since we have gone from speaking diagnostically/categorically/absolutively to continuously in psychology - whether or not it's a good idea for certain things like homosexuality is still in debate. But I do agree with you, the evidence you have presented is true. :)  

I can say anecdotally that I have two gay uncles - one on each side. Although the one on my mother's side is only her half brother.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a drag queen called Karen from Finance I got a little too familiar with. 

EDIT: We did not have sex. I was part of a show for an event that she was hosting. After that we got drunk and had some joke heavy petting backstage which I often think back to and cringe. But hey, I wanted money and to leave a lasting impression. 

She did however get me into contact with a contestant on RPDR who I simply adore and hopefully when he comes into town I can give him some road dick. ;)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I wasn't an alcoholic per se, if at a party or a club, I will get absolutely shit-faced wasted. I only ever had fancy drinks so the hangovers weren't bad, just the feeling of tiredness. Still though, while my grades were good, it was hard to keep them that high whilst getting drunk on weekends and sucking dick in bathroom stalls. 

Seriously, any form of cutting back is a great idea. Getting wasted even 3 times a week puts you into the criteria of an alcoholic and even alcohol abuse if it is impacting you negatively in some way. Alcohol is a terrible solution for anxiety - if you're doing it for that reason seriously see a therapist and get put on SSRIs. It saved my life. 

Is your goal reasonable? Yes. It's certainly doable, but I recommend seeing a therapist to help you out with the process, because if you relapse, you always fall further than when you started.  </TEXT>

While my family is far from conservative, what with my grandma visiting from Russia and wanting to go to Mardi Gras with my partner and our friends, babushka did ask me what it was like to be a bottom. While she isn't wrong about me being a bottom, I am a little astounded she knows what it means and that she outright assumed I was one. Oh grandma... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly don't think it matters either way. I believe I was born gay and that people more or less have to come to terms with their sexuality over time which experience helps them find. There is a bulk of evidence to say that we are born gay or straight or bi, but then there is a bulk of evidence counter to that. The most commonly adopted argument in psychology is that it's an interplay of nature and nurture - that our environment can help swing us one way or another, but we are born with a set point on a scale. 

Say for example I was born with a gay score of 8 out of 10, but then experience and enjoying being gay and accepting a disinterest in women pushed me up to a 10. It could also go the other way where if I was more curious, and not okay with being gay, I shift down the sliding scale. This trend is commonly found in IQ - while genetics plays a large part in IQ, it can still be impacted on by experience. 

Do I think people are born gay? Yes. Do I think that we live in a heteronormative society that can make gay people not notice they are gay or incidentally due to norms find women attractive? Yes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a difference between being sexualised and objectified, honey. Desexualisation is the act of emasculating or perpetuating that we are not capable of being sexy like white people are - sexualisation would be the removal of such. Objectification is the act of fetishising someone whilst still denying them the rights to their own sexual performance. So you're wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I don't think it really matters if it was learned behaviour or not. However, we know that we can reverse learned behaviour (a lot of fear conditioning studies and dependence/addiction studies suggest so with pharmacological, neurological and cognitive manipulations) and we know from unfortunately unethical evidence that it doesn't work for homosexuality (with the techniques we have available. 

Now whether or not it's because our science is not sound enough to extinguish certain types of learned behaviour (I doubt it) is really all up in the air. And so is whether because we can't get rid of it means that people are born that way. But if an overwhelming amount of psychologists agree that sexuality is a property akin to skin colour, then that would imply that we are born to have the propensity to be gay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You mean the DSM? 
Homosexuality was thought to be a mental illness because the first diagnostic manual included strongly held Freudian beliefs. It was a shit manual recommending lobotomies for all sorts of illnesses including depression. Psychology, like with any science, follows a zeitgeist - meaning if it is a commonly held belief by the public and by those willing to fund the research, it will be perpetuated. Keep in mind, it wasn't until the 1970's that the US completely abolished eugenics laws for those with an IQ below 70. 

The reason sexual orientation was removed was because psychologists realised that there was no benefit in treating homosexuality, but it instead made people worse off. Also the definition of psychiatry changed - we went away from classification to diagnosing treatable and recognisable pathology. Homosexuality is not a pathology, but due to social constraints it will lead to the pathologies of depression and anxiety - those factors were treatable. In the DSM-II homosexuality was revised as little more than a footnote in something called 'sexual orientation disturbance' - however, it unfortunately legitimised conversion therapy. It wasn't until the DSM-III where it was replaced by something else which again got into hot water because it was not based on the science available at the time. A quote from a good article on the history and scientific legitimacy of the subject:
it was obvious to psychiatrists more than a decade later that the inclusion first of SOD, and later EDH, was the result of earlier political compromises and that neither diagnosis met the definition of a disorder in the new nosology. [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695779/) 

Some people thought it was political, HOWEVER, extensive research by Kinsey who conducted the most prolific research on human sexuality and Evelyn Hooker's research provided substantial evidence to remove homosexuality from the DSM. 

You need to remember, scientific research before the 1940s was often shit, and a lot of research in the 50s and 60s were heavily paid for by anti-gay lobbyists for obvious reasons like a population disparity and anti-gay movements. For Kinsey, the amazing man, to even conduct his research in the 1940s was tremendous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Standards in nursing have dropped dramatically due to funding cuts and a shortage of healthcare professionals. You have a lot of people often working unpaid overtime in the health sector. I'm at least fortunate that I am a perioperative nurse and we have more breaks than other nurses, but working 12 hour days 6 days a week does get to you. Still though, I graduated with a lot of these people and I am often amazed at who actually graduates. I remember one girl who kept asking me to convert litres into millilitres and if 2 grams of ampicillin was less than 800mg. 
With the health sector so desperate, you have people who shouldn't be nurses taking on managerial roles etc further perpetuating bad nursing practice. It's a fucking joke and it honestly pisses me off that some of my colleagues will make fun of the children we performed surgery on. Dark humor is fine and all, but it's getting to a point where I think a lot of nurses are believing what they are saying rather than joking.  </TEXT>
