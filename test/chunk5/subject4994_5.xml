	<TEXT> Those numbers are insane. First - averaging a double double is impressive by itself. Secondly, both PG's averaged double doubles, and third - Stockton's assist numbers are unbelievable. 

Sometimes I don't think people realize how incredible Stockton's assist numbers are.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Facebook stock photos with carousel ads </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am trying to create a carousel ad using the free stock photos that Facebook provides - however the option doesn't even appear to select stock photos when I select "Multiple images in one ad".

Has anybody had this same problem? Facebook's own page says I should be able to use stock photos for the carousel ads: https://www.facebook.com/business/a/carousel-stock-photo. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

What are your tips for improving engagement?

	<TEXT> Yes, it is the McKay Music Library. It is literally right next to a UTA bus stop as well, so it is very convenient if you want to get somewhere quickly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just bought some tickets to the Midway Ice Castles and got them for a really good price so I thought I'd share the link if other people are interested in going. I got them through the Spingo app and they were 50% off, plus $10 off for a first time purchase through it, so two tickets were $1.20.  

Here's the link for anybody who wants to go. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spingo-events/id1001258566?mt=8 </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What's the value of a 2nd round pick? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What is the value of a 2nd round draft pick? I am a Jazz fan and we have collected about 7 second round draft picks over the next few years, and I am not very thrilled about it. 

Originally I was excited that we could use some of them to trade for a player, but it doesn't look like we are going to be doing that. For all the extra contracts we took on to acquire these 2nd round picks, it looks like we will just be sending players over to Europe for the most part - which seems like a waste of a trade to me. 

So what is the value of a second round pick, and is my opinion wrong in this case? </TEXT>
