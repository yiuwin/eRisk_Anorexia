	<TEXT> I learned the phrase as a child.  As an adult, I do not hear it often. I thought it might be interesting to bring something to the sub that non-native speakers might have never heard before.  When I'm learning foreign language, I live for this stuff--just little tidbits showing differences in culture.  Like in German, they have an expression for how to draw a smile, (*punkt punkt komma strich fertig ist das mondgesicht*) trans: Point, point, comma, line (eye eye mouth nose), finished is the moon face.  Another expression, *Komma Klar* approximate trans: all is clear.  One song links the two and says "Punkt, Punkt, Komma Klar," which is such a cool combination in my mind, that I never would have understood had it not been pointed out to me.  Does it matter that I already know how to draw a smiley face?  No.  It's just something cutesy.

Allusions to stupidity seem ill informed. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In English, just to clarify, "Righty Tighty, Lefty Loosey," is used to know which way to turn a screw or open a jar.  

I just learned in German that one of two phrases are used: *Rechts rum geht die Kaffeemhle.* (Meaning: Go right around the coffee grinder.) 

and 

*Seit das Deutsche Reich besteht, wird das Gewinde rechtsgedreht.* (Meaning: Since the German reich exists, turn the thread (screw) right.)

I'd also like clarification on *why* the second German saying exists, does this have something to do with army formation or something? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What the title said.  If I had to make a suggestion for tonight, I'd make it [El Jardn ](http://www.iloveeljardin.com/)up on 73rd and Route 2.  Sure, it's a bit north, but they usually have good marg specials. [Yelp Reviews](http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jardin-commerce-city) for the curious.  I'm determining that my residency in Commerce City makes me the local expert and I can vouch for this place. Cough cough.  (In all seriousness, I've been there a handful of times and there is good food, good drinks, and plenty of space!)

Gauging interest....if we have a steady 3-4 girls confirmed by this afternoon, I'll consider it ON and I will be there.  Feel free to text me at 630.750.5033 for a location once we're there.

Last thing--time.  What would be better...5p? 6p?

A little about me, for those who don't know me.  I'm a 25F who moved here last July (2012) from Chicago.  My interests are sports (playing, not watching), hiking, camping, crafting, marketing, teaching, also tend to be a girly girl with nails/clothes/etc even if my attempt at fashion is usually a fail. </TEXT>

Thank you greatly.  I am sending 8x10s of them to my sister in law's house ASAP.

If anyone has time, I would appreciate the editing of the following pic [here](http://imgur.com/TNlRuJR) of the kid scaling a mountain or doing some kind of intense sport.  I feel like it looks like Nike commercial material!  Or maybe being knighted?

Again, the offer stands as in my last post, any and all artists of edited pics would like decals from [this site here](http://www.ragepaints.etsy.com), please write me and I'd be happy to send some your way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Certain products are designed to be consumed at a faster rate as a result of their packaging.  A few examples I can think of are as follows:

Toothpaste.  Commercials frequently show WAY more than needed on a brush.  You need a pea size.  If you use the full length of the brush, you'll use more, and buy more.

Laundry detergent.  Ever seen the "3x strength" stuff?  This stuff is sold at 1/3 of the quantity in a super-concentrated state at a price that would be comparable to the regular strength *if you used it at the right ratio*.  The marketing ploy behind this is that you use the same amount/scoop/cupful no matter the strength of the product.  So you go through it faster, but paying 3x as much.

Soap.  The straw frequently does not reach the bottom of the container, so you can't get every last bit of the soap, it's designed at x height off the bottom, so you pitch it and buy a new one sooner.

Those are just the ones I can think of now, I'm sure there's tons more!  Also, I'm sure this isn't saving any one person a crazy amount of money by using in regular proportions, but rest assured these companies are making tons of $$$ if they get the entire population to use more than they need of any given product. </TEXT>

After a year of studying German, I picked up French.  Once I was to that point, I was in classes for all three at once, however, I found it best to not take on more than one new language at a time.  Best of luck to you! :) </TEXT>

The younger ones crab if they have a scrape from 2 weeks ago, or someone looked at them at a weird angle.  The older ones want to ditch class.  Naturally, there are exceptions, such as your case, but the overwhelming majority of kids that get in to the nurse's office are not as badly hurt as it would seem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tea, coffee, and low-cal soups (have a can of soup plus a can of water - ends up being about 200 cals, plus whatever veggies you add on top) are a great way to feel full and not consume a ton of calories.  Also, start NOW!  Just because you've binged for 3 days doesn't mean you have to binge for 3.5 days.

Also, the best advice I've read on here in regard to eating less or healthy was from a few months ago and someone summarized it perfectly.  Just do it.  It sucks.  It fucking sucks.  Just do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the one that's across from the high school at Colfax and Detroit.  A good amount of vendors there, last week had 20-30?  I get so much great, fresh produce from there every week.  Would absolutely recommend.

Edit: I've been to the Highland's one--it was in the 'off season,' a little early for summer, but I was not thrilled.  It was a bunch of potato-on-a-stick vendors and roasted/sugared nuts and the like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice!  While I haven't used dry shampoo, in order to preserve clean hair (or appear less filthy) while camping, I shampoo every other day before a trip.  This allows the amount of natural oils/grease in your hair to build-up slower, allowing for a less-greasy look.  That and baby powder for your bangs/roots works wonders on day 2 or 3 without a shower. ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay. So. I don't know what days/times the Joe Fitness things are and which are free and which you pay for, so I'm just planning on going to Red Rocks for a good old fashioned run on the stairs.  Usually I stay about an hour-ish, more or less.  I can meet someone there or we can carpool, I'm coming from Commerce City.  Leaving around 7am.


Not really expecting a response, but it'd be nice to have a running buddy.  I don't mind sprinkling in some walking with the running, either.  Oh, and if I haven't mentioned, and you haven't been, it's fucking beautiful and you should check it out when you have the time. </TEXT>

I figure I'd be way more motivated to go if I had someone to meet with there! </TEXT>
