	<TEXT> I've noticed that when Americans use the exact words "just kidding", they are just trying to cover up their true feelings which were just expressed. I find that similar terms like "just joking around" or "I'm only messing with you" are more honest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My job allows dogs, and we're hiring! We need some software developers, no experience required and we will train you on the job (CS degree preferred but not necessary if you have good problem solving skills). The main downside is that you have to work on "legacy systems" that aren't object-oriented and don't support any real version control. However, the pay is great and the office environment is not too bad. (Orange County, CA) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mini-tips:
1. Use cash whenever possible (like actual dollar bills and coins). This habit will help you "feel" the money leaving your hands, and has been shown to reduce spending. Only carry enough to cover what you expect to need that day/week, with a small buffer.
2. I try to only buy things from places with good return policies, and hang on to the receipts. If something just isn't as "magical" as I expected it to be, I return it.
3. Look over ALL your accounts on a monthly basis. I use mint.com for this, and without it, I might forget that I slowly built up a small balance on my costco/AMEX card. When I see that, I go pay it off and keep it from surprising me.
4. Find free (or nearly-free) hobbies and friends to share them with. Wait for movies to go on Netflix or iTunes rental instead of seeing everything in the theaters.
5. Get practice cooking with people who cook well, like mom, and learn this valuable skill. Eating out is super expensive and should never become a habit to those wanting to keep a budget.
6. Learn a new skill that can become a new career or side income. For me, that was photography, and now has become software development. I also made sure I performed well at my day job and I saw raises as a result. </TEXT>

Glad to hear it's faster on older devices, though! I had an iPhone 3G when iOS 4 came out and it made the phone almost unusably slow. It took at least 3 months for them to come up with an update which improved it. </TEXT>
