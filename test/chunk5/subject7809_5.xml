	<TEXT> I've been wondering since I've been playing the game heavy for the past two months if anyone on this subreddit had ever seen my character online. 

I'm on PC only. I use a regular cleric hat always and I'm a Warrior of Sunlight. I use a Dark Battle Axe and often cast miracles. I am a golden summon more than I invade. 

I did ALOT of summons (10-20) each for Vordt of the Boreal Valley, Dancer of the Boreal Valley, Abyss Watchers, and High Lord Wolnir. The only place where I might have also been seen often is red summon in Irithyll.  </TEXT>
