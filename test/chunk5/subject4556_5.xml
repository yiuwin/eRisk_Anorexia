	<TEXT> If you guys aren't familiar with The Loyal Subjects, they make action vinyls and MMPR is one of their lines.


This is the first look at their 2nd series or wave 2 for the line and you can see in the picture, there is a Mini Red Ranger.

Also it looks like this series with the Zord is based on the first movie versions. 

The ranger is not the same size as their regular figures. 

http://imgur.com/a/oeZdX Here is the sneak peek at the rest!

If anybody is interested or is already collecting them, check us out!

You are still toxic to the team environment so that makes you a toxic person. Doesn't matter if what you said was not horrible to extremely toxic on a scale...

I think they have to produce a movie for a certain time period and if they don't, they revert the rights back to Marvel.

I don't think they have to release the movie to the public as well, I remember they produced a Fantastic Four movie but never released it just to keep the rights.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the games that Kikis and Expect played, Kikis looked better so.

There are different mentality when it comes to running more than 5 men roster. As you can see from Cloud 9's 6 men roster, Smoothie and Bunny both agreed that it would be beneficial for both of them and the **TEAM** to grow together and learn together.

In this case, Kikis's mentality was always about securing his starting spot rather than looking at it from the team dynamic and helping each other grow.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "People are giving us shit because we don't currently have amateurs on our team. I'd like people to think for a quick second before getting their pitchforks out. This is a qualifier to GET IN the NACS meaning there's risk involved using unproven talent to get into the damn league in the first place. Only a moron would use 5 random players to try and get into NACS. Now that we've qualified for NACS, what does that mean? That means we can now try out players and see who is good because we aren't at risking of not being in the damn thing, but we need to keep in mind we need to be good enough to; stay in the NACS in the first place and to be able to win it/qualify for the LCS, since training players COSTS money+time from our end. We have an entire sub challenger team that we've been scrimming and even given an analyst and show them how to use data/teach them pick and bans."

As a long time hard core MOBA player from Dota and League and I also tried Smite as well the biggest turn off for me when I first played this game and tried it was the length of the game and pace of the game.

I played my first ever game and it was around 50mins and we weren't still not at the inhibs..  </TEXT>

I believe 10 players in the LCS can play for challenger team until the cut off date closer to NACS playoffs. 

They would still need 5 people for challenger aside from the 10men roster if they intend to use 10 people for LCS.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From OP's perspective as a former Riot Esports Branch but although I do think this article was a bit biased especially about Monte's bit because he is close friend with Monte. 

tl;dr: Riot wants to franchise LCS in the future so they want good LCS Team Owners so they have to weed out the bad and thinks that Badawi is shady and thinks that Riot's ruling was fair based on previous ruling and evidences. He stated that if Riot were to release the evidences, people would roast Badawi and side with Riot. \

He thinks that Monte was mislead and that accusations against him  was injust without any evidences so he suggest Monte should take it to court so Riot will have to reveal the evidences for the "millions in damages".

	<TEXT> As my title suggest, my RTT ping which is my connection ping communication to the game's server spike up to 300-500 makes the game unplayable FPS drops. 

Remember, this only happens in Quickplay and Brawl where it is 6 players on each team.

I can play smoothly on Players vs AI and Training with no lag no matter what the settings is!

I have been having this issue since Closed Beta weekend tests and have tried all the upgrading to my Nvidia drivers, etc. No issues were solved. 

I already posted it in the Overwatch tech support but also posting here incase somebody has a solution!

	<TEXT> Why?

They are basically Rioters in a sense that they are employed by Riot Games when they play in the LCS.

Pretty much when they first created LCS, there were videos/promos of pro players having to go through sessions of "marketing" yourself and how to behave while in the LCS. 

This is nothing new to be honest, just letting you know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty sure the Blue Lighting indicate his speedforce is at full, overloaded. 

Since he is supercharged with Speed Force, it stays blue.

When that girl took a lot of the speed drug, her lightening went blue and kaput.  </TEXT>
