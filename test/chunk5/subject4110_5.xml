	<TEXT> so true. After everyone started walking away I basically said I'm done talking because I know whatever I say will not change your mind.

	<TITLE> What the average Donald supporter has to go through. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-13 06:01:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all, so tonight is an amazing example of what we as Donald supporters have to go through. It's mind blowing actually. I'm currently on vacation with my girlfriends family all of whom are devout Bernie supporters which blows my mind considering they're all fairly wealthy. She had the the talk with me before the trip. "Don't start the argument, don't say anything, blah blah blah". Tonight however Id had enough. They were all poking and prodding me the entire time for being a trump supporter and today id had enough. I started reacting to their commentary with only facts and figures and was unable to receive a legitimate response from anyone. I was only called a numbskull,
A racist, and an idiot which eventually resulted in everyone leaving the discussion because they couldn't give legitimate answers to the questions that I gave them. Now I am locked out of my room sitting on the deck of the resort writing this because this ultimately goes to show you the basis on which ignorant liberals think. There is no concept of logic it is solely based upon I don't know what. I thought I'd just reach out to you beautiful people because I know that there are people out there that know the truth. Let's not let this movement die. We need to make America fucking great again. Excuse the typos as I'm typing on a cell phone in Honduras right now. I fucking love you all!!! </TEXT>

A friend of mine while we were sleeping awoke to a tall man in the room dressed in vintage attire and he walked in the bathroom. He assumed that it was one of us. He said the figure walked in the bathroom and he heard it pee only to not come out after. We had no idea the hotel was haunted and we asked the front desk in the morning they said it was haunted and even had ghost tours. Crazy how you had a ghost pee experience as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am starting to have a meltdown. I am still in the playoffs but I made the horrible decision of trading lacy for gordon. 

Now I don't know who to start at RB since Gio is a flop and Mathews is hurt. I still have Morris.

Here's where it gets difficult. I am going to bench Gio. Now it's a toss up between injured Mathews against a very legit Denver D or Gerhart against the Ravens brutal run defense. Gerhart is healthy, Mathews is not. I don't know what to do.

Also, Julio is throwing a big wrench in things for me. Here is my Lineup. Please help!!

QB - Luck
RB1 - Morris
RB2 - Mathews? Gerhart?
Flex - Watkins
WR1 - Julio Jones
WR2 - Josh Gordon
TE - Martellus Bennett
D - Eagles D
K - Gostkowski

Bench:
Giovani Bernard
Michael Floyd
Terrance Williams
Tony Romo
Mohammed Sanu
Travis Kelce
Ryan Mathews/Toby Gerhart

This is a standard league with 12 teams.

Need advice please. Losing my mind over here.  </TEXT>
