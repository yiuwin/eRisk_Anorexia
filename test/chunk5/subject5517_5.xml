	<TEXT> I can't remember the URL, but there was this website full of scary stories, the usual ones- The window that was actually a mirror, the baby sitter and the clown statue, the man in the backseat, the "when a stranger calls" type stories, those such things. Over the course of several months my 12 year old self worked through all of the 26 pages of stories with several titles per page. The theme was white with yellow and black accents and you could rate the stories with a star system, but they were shaped like monster heads. The name of the site was a compound word with no spaces ending in stories. ___stories. It started with an S. I have spent so much time looking for this site, just for nostalgia's sake, but I can't find it.  </TEXT>

Because *It is not the job of the clothing manufacturers to cater to your issues.* If you want to be an unhealthy weight, don't bitch about not being able to find clothes! When I was anorexic I wasn't always bitching that I couldn't find jeans to fit my 70 pound frame and matchstick legs. I never once took to the interwebs bitching like "Oh my god, stores not carrying sizes smaller than 00 are soooo mean and it's discrimination! Everyone has to accommodate my unhealthy body!" It is not the obligation of the world to conform to your own lethal ideals. No one is going to help you destroy yourself. If you want clothes that fit, get healthy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They always ignore the real issues.

aversive therapy- This is basically torture/ brain washing. They manipulate and change the mind by blending unpleasant stimuli. It is unethical. It is wrong. 

high unemployment rate among disabled people- Disabled people deserve equal opportunities for what they can handle. They should be able to get jobs if they are capable. 

forced institutionalization- I am so adamantly against this. I know that my personal experience with it influences that (I was forced into a mental hospital where I was sexually assaulted by one of the psychiatrist, and the fact that I was forced to be there turned what should have been a healing experience into a trauma. I entered anorexic and socially anxious and left suicidal, full of hate for myself and the world, and crippling amounts of shame) so obviously part of why I am against it is because if it didn't happen I would have never been violated, but I also feel like being forced there would make it traumatic for anyone, and people in those situation deserve to be treated with compassion, dignity, and respect, not like lesser forms of life.

police brutality- It is not ok to use your authority to abuse people.

filicide- *sigh* how can people who claim to care so much not give a shit about this? 

sexual violence against disabled women- with how much they complain about rape you'd think this would matter to them. But they only care about themselves. 

people with disabilities restricted from getting married- what about marriage equality? 

disabled people stuck in abusive households because they cant live independently- they are such hypocrites. They only care about abuse if it is against women by men. 

SJWs are really just keyboard-warrior supremacists.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But women hurt people too. If it's fear of being harmed, *just* fearing men is pointless. Women do bad shit too.

And also, there is no way to know if more men are rapists then women. The majority of rape is never reported, and it's even more unlikely to report a sexual assault by a woman. Because nobody takes it seriously. Which is wrong. Women can do just as much harm as men. 

I'm a woman and I accept that men are not inherently bad people. I also accept that women are not inherently bad people. In general, neither gender goes out of its way to harm the other. 

I get being afraid of being hurt though. Since I was sexually assault a while ago I haven trusted *anyone* who I didn't already trust (2 people) and I'm absolutely terrified of other woman, because the person who did it was a woman. But I accept that just because there are some woman who commit sexual assault and other crimes, that doesn't mean all of them are bad. I realize the fear is illogical. Just like not all en are bad just because some of them commit sexual assault and other crimes.

	<TEXT> Even he weren't being so bigoted as to refuse to accept that transwomen are women, it's not like segregating gender will prevent sexual assault or whatever in bathrooms. Women abuse other women too. It's not like if they keep men away from women that shit won't happen anymore. But he's not even talking men! He's talking about women who just happen to have been born in a body that doesn't suit them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My reason is really similar, but slightly less because I'm a woman but I was still assaulted by another woman, so they still say that it couldn't have happened, but at least I can just avoid gendered pronouns when referring to the person who hurt me. It's just really painful for it to be *denied* that it even happened or invalidated. I can't stand their idea that women are never abusers or assaulted and I hate that it has actual spread. 

I'm so sorry about what is suspected to have happened to you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always suffered from an anxiety disorder and for a while when I was child it manifested as (minor) hoarding. I couldn't throw away my fruitsnack wrappers or granola bar wrappers or happymeal boxes and I hid them under a cork board leaning against my wall. I felt the way you described, that they were animate and would be sad if I threw them away and they would get killed at the dump and I had to keep them safe. I would even play with them and called them my friends. I was only about 8 at the time though.

Eventually my mother found them and yelled at me and put them in a bag and threw them away. I cried and grieved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like if a person uses abortion as their main means of birth control, like if they do not take measures to prevent pregnancy because they feel they can just rely on abortion, then they are in the wrong. I don't think it is at all something that should taken lightly so that mentality is not right to me. 

But I think if, for example, they are using a pill but come down with a flu that interferes with the effectiveness, or started a medication that interfered with it, that then they have a right to abortion. Or that if a condom breaks they are also entitled to have one. Nobody is perfect, as is so often said, so sometimes they will mess up or something will happen. I don't think that means they should have to suffer. 


I think it should only be done when necessary (which to me means if it would hurt the one carrying it physically, emotionally, or in other ways to continue the pregnancy) and that it is not something that should just be done casually for reasons like not liking the feel of condoms.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also think it is wrong to kill and unborn child. But to me, it isn't an unborn child until around 25 weeks, because that, scientifically, is when it is. I don't believe that life starts at conception. 

I understand that because your mother could have never existed, and therefore yourself, that this is personal issue for you. I'm not trying to convince either, I'm just trying to understand your view. I try to not just accept my opinions as truth. I like to understand the world through other's eyes too. I respect your opinion as well, but likewise disagree with it. I believe that the established like of an unwilling mother matters more than a potential life, but I do see how that potential life could be meaningful. I just don't think others have an obligation to suffer on behalf of others.

It was interesting to hear your side of things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But it seems you're saying it has the right to use her body without her consent and that she doesn't have the right to protect her autonomy. 

And in the timeframe abortion is allowed, it is *not* an "unborn baby" it is a non-living mass of cells that does not experience consciousness, emotions, or anything else that would make it human until *after* the abortion cutoff.

I realize everything is a mass of cells. But some mass of cells are alive in a real way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it is not a baby yet. It has no right to become anything because it doesn't exist yet. 

And yeah, there are alternative that let the mother to *live*, but not always to be happy. Sometime she can settle for adoption, but what if her occupation prevents her from carrying it? Should she lose her job just because you think the could-be-life matters more than she does? Should she have to carry a price of her rapist inside of her for 9 months? Should she have to suffer through putting her life on hold to accommodate the potential of a life? Should she have to suffer permanent changes to her body for the potential of a life? There are cases other than medical issues where carrying a child would be damaging. 

Who are you to say that the mass of cells deserves more rights than she does?

	<TEXT> Two Bodies by Octavio Paz-

"Two bodies face to face

are at times two waves

and night is an ocean.



Two bodies face to face


are at times two stones   

                   
and night is a desert.




Two bodies face to face


are at times two roots


laced into night.




Two bodies face to face         
        
are at times two knives

and night strikes sparks.


Two bodies face to face

are two stars falling

in an empty sky." </TEXT>

We were together for 2 years and had an explosive breakup but after the dust settled realized that just because we're weren't compatible as lovers didn't mean we weren't meant to be in each other's lives. We are still friends (and I still consider him my best friend). It was fairly easy to settle back into our old dynamic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sexual assault cannot AT ALL be compared to music taste. Sexual assault *ruins lives*. Music one personally doesn't enjoy is just a mild to moderate annoyance. I was sexually assault a year ago and it's basically destroyed me. Having to listen to music I don't like playing through a store while shopping or whatever is *nothing* in comparison. 

And the line I like from the song is "there no distance between us, but a million miles". I also enjoy the musical aspects, really more than the lyrics. I think the instruments are much meow powerful than the actual lyrics in that song. </TEXT>
