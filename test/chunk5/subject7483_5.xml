	<TEXT> And of course at that point in the war, with the entrance of the United States into the war, it was lost. Materially speaking at least. What is amazing to me as I continue to study history is how everything is interconnected, if the Germans hadn't succeeded in France than they wouldn't have had the motor transport to even dream of advancing so deep into the Soviet Union, but by advancing so deep they suffered one of the most brutal retreats from Moscow. I agree with you, but had the campaign, and of course the battle, gone differently it would have changed things. A better answer on my part would have probably been Operation Barbarossa itself, because that tipped the scales against Germany so drastically.  </TEXT>
