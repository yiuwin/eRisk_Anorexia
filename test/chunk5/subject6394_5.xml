	<TEXT> I dunno what you want for a response, man. I'm just not needlessly emotional when it doesn't serve a purpose.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The giant red hurricane would be the light drizzle if we somehow evolved in those conditions, but yeah I'm aware that some will argue with me because I'm not joining in the emotionally wonderful circlejerk of it all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  We really won the lottery of the Universe, didn't we?

 A (galactically-speaking) relatively small distance away there are winds made out of gases that would melt us, ripping around at speeds that would tear our flesh from our bones.
 
 Yet my local station can spend ten minutes talking about a light drizzle, clearing later.

If we can evolve in an environment, we evolve to adapt to our surroundings. So I don't really know what point you're trying to make with this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like my first girlfriend I just had this really inexplicable feeling while I was talking to her at one point and a week later we're breaking up.

Take care this doesn't turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think perfection paralysis has prevented me from traveling before. I feel everything I do now is to meet a goal 5+ years in the future, and finding a convergent path to achieve that. 

But it's good to remember I got my foot in this door by living more in the present, and doing instead of planning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've looked into planning a vacation after posting this. I know someone who visits Seoul regularly, and could maybe plan a coordinated trip with him. 

My second-to-final point is you don't have that much time at your current paper. If you do leave to go teach, you should get up to three years at your current paper, and some really good clips. You've still got all the time in the world to travel, but, I'd get up to three years first.

This I'm aware of, and I'd also like experience writing for other beats before I left. I know I still have plenty to learn where I'm at, and could use more time whittling debt down while building a savings account.

I get stories picked up by AP periodically that I'm using to build clips.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's the process like for reporting/shooting under a local East Asian paper while teaching? I pitch the same stories to some editor in Seoul that I'd pitch here? I just stroll out of a hagwon at 5 p.m. and meet my contact for an interview before I meet a deadline? 

Maybe I'm just ignorant in how American I perceive journalism to be. I guess the same premise applies elsewhere. 

Teaching and writing sounds like such an interesting life for a while. It'd probably also be easier to get my student loans paid off.  </TEXT>
