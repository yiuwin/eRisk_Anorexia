	<TEXT>  Watch some ambulance videos from Germany or Austria

As a German I see so many morons in Germany not understanding a "Rettungsgasse", which is a path way on a Autobahn (motorway) for rescue vehicles. I even witnessed  people being t stupid to make space for a fire truck in a smallish one way road. Instead of moving past the intersection and thus allowing the truck to pass, no they stepped on their breaks and stood still.

I think you have idiots in every country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Take the other answers with a grain of salt because they all give casual responses simply from a product point of view without seeing the implications of each side.

First of Take every answer with a grain of salt. Period.

 If you follow Moore's Law, when you leave college after 4 years you can make a gaming computer that is 4x as powerful as the one you would have made for the same amount of money. 

That's not how Moore's Law works. Actually there is no clear way to say how it works. The Law says

 The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year.

It does not say anything about actual power of the components. That means in 2 years you have a machine that costs the same but is twice as complex. That does not always mean it's twice as powerful, because currently the developmeant is more into energy saving than power and from what I can see this trend will continue.

To OP:
I honestly think the PC is the better investment if you like to play games that need more power than the MacBook may be able to provide. Besides that in my opinion the Apple Watch is way overpriced if we are honest for a moment, for the most people a device like it is at the current state a gimmick nothing that gives much value for buck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  He played in junior leagues as an elementary school student, because his parents watched football and had since they were children, moved up through middle school into junior and varsity, got a scholarship to a nice college due to his play...

And that may be the case at somepoint for esports too. I mean American Football is around for more than 150 years, while esports is around for let's say 20 to 30 years so around a fifth of the time. We are at the beginning of Esports and not at the peak I think.

 Our culture simply doesn't have the idea of "There is this thing that takes work but it changes all the time" - other sports have huge histories, groundbreaking players, teams, and coaches. Halls of fame, players from multiple generations of the same families... all of that stuff works to give it more credit.

I see it different. It does not need a hall of fame to get credit. Currently it may be that people don't understand it, but in a few years who knows? In a few years all could be different. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heres the thing when dealing with riot cops: Do as they say and don't argue.  
I was rounded up on a demo against Nazis once, because I stood pretty close to a violent Antifa block. They started throwing stuff and destroying property. Riot police moved in and rounded up everyone in the vicinity, because it's way easier that way. I just did what I was told, gave my statement and was good to go after about 50mins or smth like that.

So yeah as I said, just be calm and do what they say and I think most conflicts while demonstartions heck even football games could be avoided. It always takes two sides to start shit going down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually driving slow without reason and the sole puprose to annoy someone is stupid and creating a dangerous situation on my book. The same as insulting someone who is already raging is not a good idea at all.

The truck has at least some fault to take here. Because if he had let the Camaro pass this situation would not have been there. Sure the Camaro was an douce and was at fault, but it's not the job of the truck to slow him down, he isn't a fucking cop, that's what they are there for.

The allocation of fault is maybe around 90% Camaro 10% truck or even 85% Camaro 15% truck, because yes the truck driver was a dick, nothing else. Move out of the way and save yourself and others the time and such to deal with a crash like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually FO3 and FNV are playable without any unofficial patches. The only "patch" I know of is to be able to do more with mods. The Script Extender, which also is aviable for Skyrim and needed for many mods that do more than simply adding armors or such.

Sure the Fallout games have bugs, but most I have encountered are more on the funny glitchi side like a dead body flying around or something like that. Gamebreaking bugs I have yet to encounter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't give a fuck about you or your job honestly. I was just explaining why some people may find it rude to get communications during of hours. Your life experience and how your company deals with it is irrelevant.

I just gave my experience and such as an example, but I see reading is not your strength. Also if a person feels that way they should communicate that before hand, because in the case of e mails it's not common. There are many ways to not read work related email during off hours.

Also your statement about Germany a bit down was just wrong. As I said the ruling is not that it's not allowed for the company to try to contact you, but you don't have to react and they can't give you shit for it. And there are exemptions for this case also. If you work for example if you have to be on stand-by. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Strike Germany out of it please. The law you are referring to means not that it's not allowed to send work related E-Mails to a work related e-mail account. Actually I as far as I know it has nothing to do with email but with phone calls mostly. And they don't forbid the employer to try to reach you but give you the right to refuse to accept the call.

For instance if my boss would call me right now I don't have any obligation to accept the call. If he sends me an email to my work email account which I have tethered to my phone I have no obligation to read said mail. It does not mean he is only allowed to contact me during business hours.

So to make it short and simple: Don't talk such nonsense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I disagree with you. There are people out there I know I find pretty, but that I wouldn't want to kiss or feel attracted to. For me beauty is a part of attraction but not the only part, there is more to it.  
Pretty for me means "Yeah I can see how people would find him/her attractive" when projected to people that are of an age where sexuallity is the case. For example my sister. I honestly can see how people can find her attractive and I know she is funny and such, but I personally don't find her attractive. Not only because she is my sister but also for a few other factors.

We don't know what it means in this case as OP has not really answered to it. Maybe it's something like the attitudes you are saying maybe it's something different all together. But honestly I think you are overthinking this. </TEXT>

Just because you think someone is pretty does not mean you are attracted to them it just means that you think they look good. Being attracted to someone is more than just pure "Oh yeah (s)he is pretty." . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, what he is describing is more of the [FIFA Club World Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup) than the Champions League. The Champions League is just European (and a few Countries that are on the border to Asia and Isreal). The difference is that in that cup it's clearly stated in the rules that only teams that win certian more regional tournaments can participate.  
You could say the Champions League is the qualifier for the FIFA Club World Cup as the winner of the Champions League get's the chance to participate (and mostly wins it I think [just checked 7 out of 11 winners are Champions League winner]).

So if they clearly stated in their rules that only teams with residence in certain parts of the world are allowed to participate in the tournament I think nobody would object. But being kind of back stabby about it is just wrong and hurts the tournament more than anything else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If I played a game, and announced I was being paid to play it, you know there's a good chance the published saw the video first, or insisted what I could or couldn't show.

You are right there might be, but then again I'm trusting on you as a person to not take such deals. For me that would fall under "backroom deal", because even through you say you have made a deal with the publisher there is still some stuff going on that I don't know about.  
Maybe I should've phrased it different in the first post, if you disclose not only that there was a deal, but what deal it was you took, then it's okay. For example let's say the publisher invites you and others to a tourney to test a multiplayer game and you say so before the video I think it would be okay.

If I say the game's good, do you believe me? I think it undermines trust and generally what ought to be a fairly close and friendly and trusting relationship between viewer and creator.

I don't believe anybody really if they say a game is good, because tastes are different, that's why I watch so many gameplay videos on Youtube or streams, to see the gameplay myself and to be able to decide if I would like the game or not. Granted I may not see the bugs then, but I tend to only get anoyed by really game breaking ones.  
Maybe I'm weird because of it, but the one thing that I find better about Youtube agains traditional games media is that even if you say a game is good and I don't like it the trust bond is not broken, as long as you were not activly lying about it. Who am I to decide you can't think a game is good? There are many people out there who think games are good, where I just shake my head in disbelieve, because I don't think they are good.

I honestly like your standpoint though, it's way better than taking deals and don't disclose them at all and after all it's your decision to make. Just keep up the good work, I enjoy your videos :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me the reason of AdBlock is mostly habit, honestly whenever I don't have AdBlock installed I don't get as many annoying ads as a few years back. However I want to decide whenever or not a page gets money for me visting them.

Youtube among others is unblocked though, for the reasons you stated. The people on there are providing me with free content and they should get something for their work. I know some offer others to support them, but the thing is I only have this much money but would want to support that much creators.

Also I don't see an as bad picture about sponsored content as you do. I think it's completly okay and up to the person if they do it as long as they disclose the information that they got paid for doing the video. So no backroom deal or whatever, but be up front about it. Let your fans and viewers know and they'll decide if they watch or not. </TEXT>

The lighters I have and carry with me I use for the most part to light stuff like candles or sometimes I lend/give them to friends of mine who smoke and either run out of gas or lost their lighter. In my opinion a lighter is a little neat thing that is always good to have at least one of, they don't cost much. </TEXT>

Ohterwise every manufactor of anything that had to do with the production of the video e.g. of the couch, the tv, the video editing program, needs to get a cut from the revenue generated from the video. </TEXT>

Nintendo got money from him for the console, the game(s) and the peripherals, they don't need no friggin money from the video HE makes, the video HE puts the effort in, not Nintendo. The program itself is bullshit and something like that should never be accepted. </TEXT>

Same goes in my opinion for Russia in China. I think it easier to understand the things going around in the countries when you know their history to a degree.  
Also for example we learned a bit about the French Revolution, because it had some influences in Germany too, a few direct but many more indirect which you wouldn't know where influenced by it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude I work at a Webhoster I deal with registrars everyday and while some offer it many do not and as far as I know the ICANN is shifting away from allowing it because they want a centralized whois database and for that they don't want any private whois.

Also private whois can take many formes. For example in the DeNIC whois you won't find the telefon number or email of the owner or tech-c . For eu-Domains if you are a natrual person only the e-mail is shown.

And even for the ones that offer private whois they still take you personal data and if they get a cease and desists letter or someother form of legal threat against them. The ones that don't are currently at the stake of loosing their service because it could be argued that they violate the domain registration requirement of the ICANN, which after all is the highes NIC there is.

So to make it clear: If the owner of the domain uses a normal whois privacy service they will give the info away after they recieve legal letters. If not than they are shady in my eyes. I can understand and support the first version, but the second is just clearly aimed at a certain type of people and I don't think that those types should be allowed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The acting is sometimes needed to make the ref see the foul. There are in total 4 refs while one is not on the field and can't make calls. At any given moment there are 2 refs who are able to see a foul and only one to decide if it was a foul. There are normally 20 people around the ref all doing stuff so it's hard for a ref to see everything. Also there are smallish fouls which the refs can't really see and they happen so often.  
Another thing is that some players are fouled so often and don't always get the free kick that they see the acting as their only way of getting their "right". Players like C. Ronaldo, Robben and even Messi are always a target for numerous fouls because the defenders can't always stop them clean. 
While I agree the acting is getting out of hand I also see the point of the players to a degree. But "soccer is a fucking joke" yeah sure it's a joke, that's why it's the most popular and revenue giving sport in world. Because it's a fucking joke like the "sport" Wrestling or the stop and go American Football. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that there are labels which are needed and it's okay to have them, but one should not let them guide yourself. Social groups are after all a true thing and do exists, but nobody is only his/her social group, there is always more and when you keep that in the back of your head it's always easier to not be openly biased because of stuff like that.  
So labels are not always a bad thing only if you let them dictate how you treat others. But the labels "good guy" and "bad guy" are just as bad as the labels "bitch" and "good girl", they don't say anything about the person really. They are not something to identify a social group, but only a label to either lower others or higher ourselfs. Funnily enough both labels are used for both, depending on the person you are talking to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  No they are wise. More good was brought by uniting the people of the west than Gandalf going ham on Sauron.

So they say, but wouldn't a wise being prevent it all from happening? Why would all the Elves, Drawves and Humans have to suffer so much, just because on of the Valar wanted more than was given to him. How does it show Wisdom if they don't prevent it?

 efore the war of the ring the elves and dwarves were at each other throat

Even after LotR the drawves and elves are still on each other throats, but now most of the elves left or are leaving Middle Earth and with them all Magic fades from it. Soon afterwards the Realm of Men will be with out Magic and the tales of the Elves will be long forgotten. 

 gondor was rule by a tyrant and there was building tension between gondor and Rohan.

True, but that was also just because the Valar did not help the heroes of old getting rid of the evil at its root. They did nearly nothing to help them against Morgoth and many tragedies are to be found in the history of Middle Earth, most of which could've been prevented.

In my opinion the Valar are either not as mighty as one is made to believe or they have long lost interest in the fate of Men and Middle Earth.

But I think a discussion about it would be as fruitless as a discussion about if God (the christian one) is merciful or not. As far as I know there are no sources from Tolkien about what the Valar made from the thing happening in LotR </TEXT>

They even eat less most of the time than me, but they only seem to get down to a certain weight.

	<TEXT> I don't think it has to be with "fat bastards" as you say. All what /u/MattieShoes said is that through time your priorities change. He did not condem people who are not attracted to fat people, he just explained why it seemes that more young people feel that way and why there are often out cries when somebody says that he is not attracted to a certain type of body.  
Honestly what he says makes sense. The superficial stuff is what gets your attention but it's the inner stuff that keeps you at a person for a longer period of time. After a while it may not even matter as much if they are super in form or if they have let them go, because you are with them because of their personality not because of their body.  
Alas (s)he never said anything in the regard that it's wrong to not be attracted to something only that from his point of view this may change.

/u/dietbroccoli get's downvoted because he is an ass and nothing else. He insults someone who answers in a calm matter to his post. Not because there are thounds upon thounds of "fat bastards" swarming his post and angrily downvoting it. Yeah there maybe a few of those, but I don't think that's the majority. </TEXT>

That always bugged me as hell. I mean after all Sauron was a servant of the Valar he is not a Men, nor Dwarf nor Elv he is more like a demi god. And he is only there because the Valar did not remove him after defeating Morgoth. As much as I like the Universe the Valar are dicks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because if you are not an excellent player in the game you will still be in the average. The average is not a small margin, the average is where most of the players are and a few excell the average and a few are under it, but I'm pretty sure you are still average in Counterstrike . And as I said before: Skill is not determined by the time you spent on a game, there are way more factors to consider and the time played is just one of them. You can know all you want about the game if you lack in the technical skill to execute what is needed you won't be one of the best players.  
And no it's not a waste of time to spent hours in anything even if you are average. It's a waste of time if you are not enjoying yourself, but one does not have to be above average to have fun. If you've put it in the context of saying "if I don't enjoy a game" yeah then it's a waste of time, but then every hour more than needed to find out you don't enjoy is "wasted" eventhrough I still thing time wasting is in general an conecpt that does not make sense, but that has nothing to do with this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying that you don't liking it is stupid, but your saying "If you spend 1000hrs in it and are just average it's a waste of time" that is what I call stupid. Nothing else. So please read the stuff I wrote with that in mind. If I didn't make that clear in the first comment sorry, English is not my first language and thus I may have used wrong words or phrased it wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You seem to get hanged on the point that I think that opinion is stupid because it's regarding MOBA, which is not the case. I would find an opinion like that always stupid, because for me it shows that a person is very narrowminded. I accept that you have another opinion that does however not change the fact that I think that the opinion is stupid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not calling you out for not liking MOBAs I am calling you out on a stupid opinion. You are saying spending thousand hours in a game and being average is a waste of time, which is just stupid in my eyes. There is nothing wrong with being average in a game. If one does not a like a game for whatever reason it's okay, but saying it's a waste of time that's not okay.  
Also with your CS:GO if you are above average than there is reason beyond the knowledge of the game and that's what I wanted to make clear. The time you spend on something does not determine alone how good you are, if you are inept at something you can spend millions of hours on it but still wouldn't be as good as a talented person.  
That goes for art, games, sports, whatever. It's not alone the time factor that is deciding if you are above average and only because you are still average after so many hours it is not a waste of time, if you are enjoying it. If you are not enjoying it then yeah it maybe a waste of time, but than again I don't think anyone would spend thounds hours on something that they don't enjoy, well except work maybe, but that is not part of this discussion.  
The thing with most MOBAs is that they need many hours to know the game and you need to be talented in it otherwise you'll reach a cap from which you can't improve anymore. But that's the point with every game I have encountered so far, that has somekind of competitive scene. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That's exactly my point. One thousand hours in a game and you're still average? That is an enormous waste of time in my eyes, especially when it's a game that is more frustrating than enjoyable for me.

Sorry but that is kind of a stupid stance. How many hours do you think hobby football players or soccer player or whatever sport player put into it? And still most of them are average.  
To be part of the top percentile of any sports or game you not only have to know the game inside and out, but also have technical skillset for it. That means in case of a MOBA you must have the reaction times to do clutch plays, you must have the "eye" to see what the enemy is doing without seeing it directly. Just as successfull athletes have to know the sport but also have have a certain talent in the sport.  
You can play thounds upon thounds hours of any sport but never get to the point where you are one of the best, just because you don't bring the right talents for the sport. That's nothing bad. </TEXT>
