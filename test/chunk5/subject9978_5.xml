	<TEXT> It's likely a kids water play area.  You see similar ones in parks sometimes around here.  Water sprays straight up, kids run around, fun is had. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be interesting to enhance the plot by color coding by type of set.  It could highlight if things like licensed brand sets tend to cost higher than average.  Of course, there are better plots to highlight that type of information.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure - then only prep a good cover letter for those special jobs you're really excited about.  Just don't expect to get a call back on the other hundreds of jobs.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't speak to other fields like design, but if a cover letter is ever listed as "optional", still write a good one and include it.  The worst that happens is you spent an extra hour and it didn't help.  In the best case, it made the difference between getting to an interview or not.  Whether a manager reads them largely depends on two things: how many applicants are there (is it dozens or hundreds) and the personality of the manager (you can't predict that unless you know someone in the company).  Large companies may also have a first-pass performed by the HR department and if you don't meet the minimum qualifications, then you may be cut without someone reading it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are still in a good position to do things to make yourself stand out.  Competing for a job right out of school can be hard, so your cover letter can talk about a capstone project at school, experience you gathered with an internship or a personal IT project.  Come up with something interesting, unique and challenging - don't just do the minimum to complete your degree.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is a fair question and there are a couple of aspects to my view:

First, I don't just want the person with the best stats, I want someone who is motivated, interested in the job and excited at the opportunity.  None of these things come across in a resume.  Unless you're doing Amazon Turk tasks, your personality will be a key aspect to how successful you are at a job and thus an important factor in hiring.  

Second, while you might read your resume and the job description and see the connection about how your time in X job is applicable to this job, it might not be obvious to others.  A cover letter is the linkage between the job description and your experience.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been reviewing job applications and have been disappointed in the cover letters that applicants have been attaching, so I thought I'd put in some tips from the perspective of someone hiring.  Note that I'm in the technology space and some norms may differ in other professions.  I also choose review all applications, whereas some organizations/managers might have the HR department pre-screen.  There are some good articles out there as well - I think this Forbes one (particularly the video) covers some good basics: http://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2012/08/29/6-secrets-to-writing-a-great-cover-letter 

Why is a cover letter important?  It is your first opportunity to convince a hiring manager that you are the best candidate for this job and the best addition to their team.  A good one won't guarantee you the job, but a bad one will ensure you don't get an interview.

An important side note - **the less qualified you are for the position, the more important your cover letter**.  You need to convince the hiring manager that your motivation, energy, skills, etc. will make you a stronger addition to the team than someone who might have more experience, but failed to be interesting in their cover letter.  However, don't make stuff up - hiring managers read a lot of these and we can tell when it's BS.

First and foremost: **attach a cover letter** if the application process requests one.  If you are asked for one and don't include it, odds are you'll be cut in the first pass.  You'd be surprised how many people miss a chance because of this simple mistake.  If you aren't sure you should include one, attach one anyway - better safe than sorry.  

**Make the cover letter specific to that job**.  This differentiates you from the mass of folks submitting generic cover letters.  Most folks want to hire someone interested in *this job* not just *any job*.  We want people who are interested and excited about the opportunity.  Mention something in the job description that peaked your interest.  Mention something you've done/learned that aligns to the job description. Generic cover letters are so common that these first two items can at least put you in the upper half (or higher) of the stack.  

Show some personality, but don't lose your focus.  It can be good to mention how how your volunteer work or travels taught you a professional lesson, but don't spend a paragraph talking about your cat.

Proofread and then have another person proofread.  There is always someone who has a typo or grammar error in the sentence about their writing skills.  

Double and triple check that you are attaching/uploading the correct cover letter.  Name each file with the company name to help you keep track (something like "Jane Doe Cover Letter Acme Corp.pdf").  It seems like there is always at least one person who attaches a cover letter that references a different job.   </TEXT>
