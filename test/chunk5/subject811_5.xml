	<TEXT> For the 2 Toronto shows, VIP was gone within seconds, General Admission took about 15-20 minutes to sell out.  

This Chicago show is an All Ages event so they might sell out even faster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't really thought about the Tup-Tups but that's an interesting inquiry!  

 I know some people are really into making TWRPsonas of themselves. Like, what kind of character they would be if they existed in that universe. Kind of similar?

I still find "Tup-Tup" equally embarrassingly as it is awesome. </TEXT>
