	<DATE> 2017-04-09 02:53:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm having trouble wrapping my head around this, my understanding is that Littlefinger murdered Jon Arryn so Ned could become hand of the king and when Ned is in King's Landing a rivalry between the Starks and Lannisters will develop.

How does this benefit Littlefinger, was it just so he could take control of The Vale or is there something that I'm missing? </TEXT>
