	<TEXT> Sorry, I guess that wasn't exactly clear.  

Most distillers of (good) whisky age their wares before selling it to the public.  In Canada, for example, the law dictates that any whisky sold to the public must have been aged in small wood for at least three years; your basic bottle of cheap Canadian Club, for example, boasts only of having "exceeded" this limit, though they're understandably vague on the rest.  Canadian Club Reserve is aged for 9 years, and CC Select for 12.  Other (and frankly much better) distilleries have other options available, with things starting to get more pricey around the 12- to 15-year-old range.  Lagavulin 16 is a personal favourite, but that will cost you $120 Canadian a bottle.  This is "a lot" where just getting drunk is concerned, but in terms of expensive spirits of this sort it's still almost nothing; Glenlivet has an exceptionally rare line of 50-year-old scotch that will set you back roughly $25,000 (American) a bottle.

All of this is to say that a) age matters, a lot, and b) because of this, distilleries have to make decisions quite a long while in advance if they want to have aged spirits of this sort to bring to market.  Sometimes these decisions have to be made so far in advance that a literal generation of people will be born and come to adulthood in the time between starting the process and putting the whisky up for sale.  Which, let's face it, is amazing.  These distillers were certainly in the market for things like this before, but I was curious about how those functioning at the outward limit of the /r/AskHistorians 20-year-rule coped with trying to predict the markets of 2015.  Certainly any well-established distiller could have laid down some reserves in 1965 and been basically assured of reaching a very wealthy market fifty years later, but middle-ground stuff is more interesting to me because it comes to market more regularly and is more broadly accessible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like cauliflower a lot.  That being said, the only two ways I've yet seen it really shine as a "substitution" were these:

- As "wings' -- seasoned, roasted in the oven, and then drizzled with whatever sauce.  They have a crunch, sweetness, and modes thickness of texture to them that makes them pretty good.  Not actually chicken wings, but they kind of have the same shape?  And, again, very tasty.

- As an addition to the "crust" of a shepherd's pie -- turned into a puree and then deployed like mashed potatoes.  It was a vegetarian shepherd's pie to begin with, so it ended up working very nicely.

I will be clear that I put "substitution" in scare quotes above because these aren't *really* fooling anyone -- but they do taste pretty good all the same.  That's all I'm really looking for in the end, I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello Dr. McNeur!  Thank you for coming out today.

I'd like to start off with four questions, if I may -- but please don't feel compelled to answer all of them!

1. Given the rising popularity (and, arguably, necessity) of modern urban agriculture, what lessons might we learn for today from how this matter was addressed in New York's past?

2. How did New York's experience in this direction compare with that of other "rising cities" of the era?

3. How did the fact that so much of the city was on an island impact the sort of decisions that were made where these issues are concerned?

4. What (if any) are your thoughts on Will Eisner's various New York stories?  Many of them take place, or at least begin, around the time that you've described in your post above -- and often depict the struggles involved in seeing small farms and country homes gradually giving way to urban sprawl and tenement culture.

Thanks again for being here, in any event.  Your book sounds terrific, and I hope to check it out once the current teaching term is over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They were discussing a contract for 15000 tanks. you can argue all you want but somebody with the information on hand at the time thought tanks were a solution in 1918.

Right -- and Churchill wanted 10000, and J.F.C. Fuller wanted 2500, and each imagined that his grandiose plan would spell victory at some distant point.  The reality is that these orders were based on the projected achievement of tank models that mostly existed on paper, and which in no possible sense could be "a solution in 1918."  There was no manufacturing centre on earth that could have produced that many tanks for the Allies in so short a time, especially given the corresponding material/materiel demands of the various Allied navies.

You're certainly right that the "tank revolution" was stalled by their relative lack of civilian utility during the inter-war period, but we have to accept the fact that they did not win the first war or come anywhere close to doing so, no matter what certain visionaries at the time might have hoped.  Fuller, in particular, seemed almost upset that the infantry were able to win the war at last without his imagined waves of tanks coming to fruition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The initial idea for the tanks seems to have come from Major-General Sir Ernest Swinton, who in October of 1914 first proposed:

 a power-driven, bullet-proof, armed engine, capable of destroying machine guns, of crossing country and trenches, of breaking through entanglements, and of climbing earthworks.

This amazing weapon was duly designed, and the first "tanks" (so-named to convince any unscrupulous observers watching their parts being shipped that they were merely new water tanks) made their limited debut at Flers on September 15, 1916, where they met with mixed success. 

Their "influence" is somewhat difficult to measure given the limitations involved in producing and deploying them in the first place.  On the one hand we are confronted with the tremendous enthusiasm of pretty much everyone involved, with certain notable theorists, statesmen and generals of the time almost convinced that the tank could win the war alone; on the other hand we are confronted with the construction problems, design flaws and environmental factors that plagued them from the first moment of their existence, and in the end must acknowledge that they were very far from living up to what had been expected of them.

We hear a lot about how "the generals" (that monolith!) resisted new technology out of some hidebound lack of imagination or fear that it wasn't somehow "proper."  This is a greatly exaggerated thing to begin with, but in terms of tanks it's very far from the truth indeed. There was less reluctance about introducing the new weapon than there was regret that they could not introduce more of them and confusion over how to introduce them at all.  They were damnably expensive to produce, slow to build, difficult to transport, and dramatically diminished in their power once the initial shock at their appearance had worn off.  Still, many of their early proponents were almost fanatics on the subject; Winston Churchill, for example, in his capacity as Minister of Munitions in 1918, drafted a wildly hypothetical plan of attack that called for 10,000 tanks backed by an additional 8,000 to 10,000 tracked support vehicles (precursors to the APCs of the second war).  This is a fantastic idea, or to be more precise fantastical; it ignores (as Churchill should have known then, but as he continued to ignore in his memoirs of the war published in the 1920s and 30s) the fact that no such manufacturing capacity existed, anywhere, to produce this number of tanks on the kind of timeframe that was envisioned.  

We might look also to the ideas of Major General J.F.C. Fuller, who in the Spring of 1918 was inspired by the sight of British troops retreating near Peronne to imagine a future in which the tank made such a thing unnecessary.  His idea ultimately became known as "Plan 1919", and we can find a fine description of its potential in A.J. Trythall's biography of Fuller:

 [The basic concept] was derived from the question, 'Why were our troops retreating?' and the answer 'Because our command was paralysed.'  The concept was 'strategic paralysis', to be brought about by attacking and cutting off the enemy's brains, in other words his field headquarters, from his fighting troops.  'Plan 1919' was originally called 'The Tactics of the Medium D Tank', but before becoming 'Plan 1919' became 'Strategical Paralysis as the Object of the Attack'.  According to Fuller himself the idea was 'a psycho-tactical one', but he used 'strategical' rather than 'tactical' in conjunction with 'paralysis' because 'the primary aim of the attack was to paralyse the enemy's command and not his fighting forces... that is his strategical brain and not his fighting body.'

Fuller had based this plan on the imminent production of a then-still-hypothetical piece of weaponry, the Medium D tank.  A single experimental model had been built in 1918 -- that was it.  *On paper* it was absolutely wonderful by comparison to the rest of the tanks then available, but it only really existed on paper to begin with.  This didn't stop Fuller from drafting a plan that would require 1,600 of the things, however, and an additional 400 smaller support tanks -- a plan that the course of events rendered moot, anyway, given that the war ended without it.

Those commanders who were able to make use of the tanks while the war was still in progress sent in similarly enormous purchase orders; Sir Douglas Haig, for example, had been absolutely convinced of the tank's importance even five months before any of them even arrived for his inspection, and only four days after their first action would place an order for another 1,000, to be delivered as quickly as possible.

The realities were almost dismal by comparison.  There were *49* tanks available for their initial debut at Flers; only 32 of these actually reached the Front, with the rest being sidelined by a variety of mechanical and environmental problems.  Further problems at the Front itself prevented all but 25 of the new vehicles from being deployed, and only 9 actually even made it to the German lines -- not an explosive start.

Still, they were an arguable success in their debut -- if we may call demonstrating dramatic potential without achieving much of it a success -- and one would think that Haig's enthusiastic request for a thousand of them would lead to increased production... but one would be wrong.  By the opening of the Arras offensive six months later, only 60 were actually on hand, most of them actually having been refurbished from the action at Flers!  By the height of Third Ypres this had only increased to 136.  The opening of 1917 had seen the office initially in charge of tank production (the Heavy Branch of the Machine Gun Corps) make plans to produce 1,460 new tanks in the first nine months, including 1,000 of the Mark IVs and even, later in the year, some of the new Mark Vs.  None of the latter ever did get produced that year, and of the former only 378 ever made it to the Battle of Cambrai in November -- where they were admittedly used to great effect.  

None of this was made any easier by inter-departmental competition and basic design oversights, either.  The Admiralty had been keeping a stranglehold on the supply of steel plate necessary for mass production of the tanks, and it was discovered belatedly that highly anticipated Mark IVs were being defeated in the field by the simple expedient of the Germans widening their trenches by two or three feet.  This had been anticipated by the officers staffing the Tank HQ near the front lines, but none of the early recommendations they had made about improving the Mark IV's design had actually been accepted by its manufacturers, who felt they knew better.

The war's closing stages during the Battle of Amiens saw the deployment of a comparatively large number of tanks -- 342 Mark Vs and 72 Whippets.  While they proved a potent force indeed, it would be worth considering their casualty rates:

- August 8th, 1918: 414 deployed
- August 9th, 1918: 145 still fit for action
- August 10th, 1918: 85 still fit for action
- August 11th, 1918: 38 still fit for action
- August 12th, 1918: 6 still fit for action

Clearly there were still problems to be solved.

The main one was speed.  Considerably behind the cavalry, armored cars and motorcycles of the time, the top speed of the 1918 Mark V on a smooth, open road was only 4.6 miles per hour.  The same speed for the Medium Mark A Whippet was a more promising 8.3 miles per hour -- but, again, on a clear open road.  Across the sort of crater-strewn, uneven terrain in which they would *actually* be deployed their usual speed was closer to 1-1.5 miles per hour -- hardly a replacement for cavalry when it came to swift maneuvers and immediate exploitation.  They were also very poor as troop carriers; the great lumbering machines had serious ventilation problems that routinely left those riding in them in a state of near collapse after any sustained amount of time -- certainly in no condition for quick and dynamic action.

Worse still was the fact that, in spite of having been designed to repel small arms fire with impunity and traverse a variety of difficult terrains, there were still so many things that could just turn them into expensive wrecks at the drop of a hat.  The things basically destroyed themselves; they were forever getting stuck in shell craters, or falling into trenches, or getting flipped over coming up or down hills, or simply breaking down in the middle of No Man's Land, stranding their crew in a very dangerous position indeed. Their armor was only barely "bullet-proof", and was in most cases wholly incapable of stopping the armor-piercing rounds developed to deal with them. Artillery was even worse; the gigantic, ponderous objects made amazing targets for gunners, and it was rare that more than a single well-aimed shell was needed to destroy one.

Sometimes this was taken to absurd extremes: the only German officer to have received the distinction of being mentioned in dispatches by Field Marshal Haig was the one who managed, while serving his gun single-handedly, to destroy sixteen British tanks one after another, each with a single shot. Haig notes this with a tone of frank admiration that was shared even by those on the scene, and it was a matter of some regret that the dedicated officer was finally killed at his gun.

I have no doubt that /u/elos_ may be along to add to all of this in his typically excellent manner, but this is what I've got for now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman, according to his delightful memoirs (*Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman*), was a great fan of working while he ate.  This was fine when he was on his own, but he grew annoyed at the interruptions from servers when he happened to be out at a restaurant.  This became especially frustrating to him when the server would ask him what he wanted for dessert -- by this time he had been working on whatever problem was in his head for the whole of the meal, and he hated to be drawn away from it for even a second.  This played in to his already well-developed frustration with the problem of choice -- of having to waste time deciding on the right course of action when that course would be just as rewarding no matter how quickly it might be arrived at (so long as it actually WAS right).

As a consequence, he made the early and somewhat astounding decision to never eat any dessert other than chocolate ice cream again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah!  Sorry -- I shouldn't have assumed unfamiliarity with the work on your part, though the comment was intended to explain it to other readers as well.

And I agree entirely about Hochschild's introductory piece -- good grief.  Why can't these things be done in a more precise and less histrionic fashion?  The recent anthology reprints of *Charley's War* are a positive god-send by comparison.

I also have to wonder why Sacco's work has since been immortalized as a gigantic mural in a metro station in Paris.  Surely the French passers-by will be perplexed to see not a single one of their countrymen represented in this depiction of one of their most important battles of the war...? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Germans are faceless, nameless foes, the French are barely even mentioned at all! 

If you want to see this abstract problem immanentized pretty powerfully, check out Joe Sacco's recent and rather over-praised comic tableau, *The Great War*.  It's a fourteen-foot image depicting the whole of the first day on the Somme at a variety of moments, and nowhere in it will you see a single French or German figure.  I guess they just didn't bother to show up that day? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For what it's worth, the passage you've quoted is yet another example of Bloom's tendency to make sloppy and inaccurate claims about books he deems to be beneath his notice.  He is simply lying about the recurrence of "stretch/stretched [his/her] legs" in *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*; having just searched through a digital version of the book for every conceivable permutation of this phrase, I have found that it occurs exactly **once** -- and nothing remotely like it again thereafter.

Bloom's criticisms of modern writing long ago ceased to fill me with confidence, and this kind of thing is one of the reasons why. </TEXT>

Many different pieces of Vietnam-focused media include the song in some fashion, from movies to television shows to video games.  Given the tremendous proliferation of popular and now-classic music during the Vietnam era, how did "Fortunate Son" seemingly become the one that has really stuck?  Perhaps it's a lack of imagination on my part, but I can think of no other single piece of music that has become so permanently associated with that conflict. </TEXT>

I do recommend Saki most heartily, in any event.  If you haven't read this piece, "[The Background](http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/Bac.shtml)", or "[The Toys of Peace](http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/ToysPeac.shtml)", all would make good places to start.

	<TITLE> In early 20th-century England, was "having a headache" ever used as a sexual euphemism? Details within... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-21 18:11:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I tend to focus on the literary and military dimensions of this particular period, for obvious reasons, so there are still some gaps to fill in other respects.  

In reading one of Saki's marvelous stories (["The Unrest Cure"](http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/UnrCur.shtml)), I've come across a female character who has specific times of the week in which she retires to her bedroom to "have a headache."  At one point during the story, she is paid some excessive compliments by a handsome young man who seems to be a prince--at which point she immediately runs up to her bedroom "to have as much headache as possible before the Bishop's arrival."

Now, all of this could just be intended to be read straight: the characters are meant to be a pair of dull and unexciting people whom a prankster has determined to shake up with a series of hoaxes.  Nevertheless, it seems sort of provocative all the same.

I know we have at least one poster here who has a lot to say on Edwardian sexuality (paging /u/zeroable), but I'm curious if anyone else can also provide some insight into this. </TEXT>

I highly recommend next year's sessions to anyone who is interested in learning more about a variety of aspects of DH.  They have courses on everything here, from beginners' XML to digital approaches to indigenous histories to sound archiving and more.  There are lots (LOTS) of scholarships and travel grants available through the Institute itself, and they host a corresponding conference to both encourage research sharing and provide a conference destination for students seeking funding from their own departments and unions.

This entertaining, accessible, and nevertheless rigorous book examines the contours of the war's popular memory and how it came to exist, taking a great deal of care along the way to puncture certain myths and smooth over certain inconsistencies.  It is less combative and militarily-oriented than Gordon Corrigan's *Mud, Blood and Poppycock* or Gary Sheffield's *Forgotten Victory*, both of which have similar debunking missions in mind, and so far more likely to win over skeptical readers to its central thesis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're very welcome!  If you're interested in the various campaigns that achieved such amazing things during the First World War, additionally, I'd recommend David Monger's excellent [*Patriotism and Propaganda in First World War Britain*](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/patriotism-and-propaganda-in-first-world-war-britain-9781781380130?cc=ca lang=en ) (2013) or Troy Paddock (ed.)'s *World War I and Propaganda* (2014), both of which offer excellent recent overviews of their particular subjects.  Monger's in particular offers a great history of the National War Aims Committee and its various poster campaigns aimed at civilians.

For a broader view, the long-awaited second edition of Randal Marlin's *Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion* finally came out in 2013, and offers a solid book-length overview at the history and theory of propaganda in all its forms.  It tends to lean very hard on the ideas of Jacques Ellul, another propaganda theorist of whom Marlin was once a student, but it's a decent and highly-accessible introduction to the subject. </TEXT>

My God.  Kitchener was the Secretary of State for War, not "the leader of the British army."  He made broad policy decisions, not minute tactical ones.  It's like saying that Donald Rumsfeld led the American Army in Iraq, or that he determined platoon-level combat doctrine.

They also have a production of *King Lear* featuring Ian McKellen and one of *Hamlet* featuring Patrick Stewart and David Tennant, but I haven't had the chance to check them out.  Still -- they're free, they're not outdated old BBC productions, and they're there. </TEXT>

His friend and executor, Walter Hooper, continued putting out material after Lewis' death, much of it seemingly gleaned from his archives and notes.

	<TEXT>  He was, but did he write any fiction in English? I'm not aware of any that wasn't translated from Spanish. While I may of course be missing something, I suspect that anything that an undergraduate is likely to encounter will be in translation.

Well, that's a good question.  I had been given to understand that many of his later works (whether fiction, poetry, or critical) had been written first in his own English and then "cleaned up" a bit, but I'm at a bit of a loss to name specific names just at the moment.  Certainly the major "classroom" stories like Garden, Lottery, Library, etc. are all in translation.

I recall that the Hurley translations have not been universally well-received; the "Collected Fictions" volume in the recent Penguin reprint trilogy attracted some criticism for working only with Hurley's translations, for example, where the "Selected Non-Fictions" and "Selected Poems" drew from a variety of translatory voices.

I will admit that my first encounter with Borges was through the pieces contained in *Labyrinths*, and so I have a sort of quiet bias towards those particular versions of each work.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's my contention that the whole sub-genre of "magical realism" exists so literary critics can read fantasy without having to admit that they're reading fantasy.

With respect, I think your contention is wrong, and I think that a lot of the reason why it's wrong has to do with what "magical realism" has putatively *become* rather than with what it *was*.  

When the painter Franz Roh popularized the term in 1925 (in *Nach Expressionismus: Magischer Realismus*) he was not covering for literary critics or fantasy writers or anybody; he was trying to describe something that he and the members of his artistic school were doing, especially to distinguish it from the work of the Surrealists even as it was firmly situated within many of the same contexts.  When Alejo Carpentier penned his famous preface to *El reino de este mundo* (1949), announcing the critical importance of *lo real maravilloso* to the proper understanding of Latin American literature and cultural identity, "fantasy novels" as we might now describe them were very, very far from his mind.  

If you could read Carpentier, or Miguel ngel Asturias' *Men of Maize* (1949) or Wilson Harris' *Palace of the Peacock* (1960), and call them "fantasy novels" for which "literary critics" have just invented a fake sub-genre to preserve themselves from embarrassment, well... sir, I cannot agree.  The magic-realist text, in these terms, hinges upon the livid oppression of humidity, the fever dream, the inappropriate juxtaposition of dislocated objects, the still-potent vitality of a mythology in the making rather than the sterile exhumation of myths already dead.  It hinges upon the full embrace of Todorov's conception of "the fantastic" without ever necessarily trying to resolve it in either the uncanny or the marvelous; we are obliged instead to embrace the centrality of the mystery and also the irrelevance of the mystery.

I urge you to check out this selection from Carpentier, ["On the Marvelous Real in America"](http://www.graduateschools.uni-wuerzburg.de/fileadmin/43030300/Heise-Materialien/carpentier-marvelous_real.pdf) -- it has much to say about the roots of this particular critical sub-category, and says more eloquently than I can what its progenitors were actually hoping to achieve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't speak for the American side of this, but in the case of Great Britain, at least, this option was not actually given to the bereaved.  A massive scheme of universal interment was devised by the Imperial War Graves Commission under the guidance of Sir Fabian Ware; the scheme ensured that the British fallen would be buried in (more or less) the same earth upon which they died rather than being sent back across the Channel either piecemeal or en masse.  I am sure there are individual cases that slipped through the cracks, but in the main this was established as policy.

	<TEXT>  What could we learn about Shakespeare from a single play that we didn't learn from 37 others (with different editions) and a large assortment of sonnets? 

I have to take exception to this evaluation, at least in part.  

The answer is "*probably* not much, but *possibly* quite a lot."   In this particular case the play is already a known quantity that isn't held in very high esteem even by those who have read it, but it's still an addition to the corpus of an author who exists to us primarily through his work (given the scanty biographical details left for us).  That is not insignificant.

I feel as though a lot of this dismissal is coming from the fact that *Double Falsehood* is just not especially good or interesting.  I doubt very much that we'd be saying the same thing if it had always been accepted as a Shakespeare work but suddenly we found a 38th in the form of, say, *Hamlet*.  That "single play" would be a pretty important addition indeed.

Still, I do agree that this isn't likely to change much.  The kind of titanic revision that some people seem to hope for would probably have to come with something like the discovery of a totally unknown collection of verifiable Shakespeare plays with titles like *Henry II Pt. I*, *Love's Labours Forfeit*, *The Tragedy of Tarquin*, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, one interesting example of this is the name of the show itself.  

There is no "Downton Abbey" -- but there *is* Highclere Castle, where the thing is filmed, and which has now become far more famous as a setting for a fictional program than it ever was as an actual place where real people lived.  Even the recent publication of [a memoir](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/lady-catherine-the-earl-and-the-real-downton-abbey-the-countess-of-carnarvon/1115886892?ean=9780385344968) of Lady Catherine, wife of the 6th Earl of Carnarvon, had to be festooned with "Downton" branding (even in its actual title) instead of just focusing on the actual real person who actually really lived in this real place.

In any event, I'm mainly looking at the way in which the program echoes modern ideas and anxieties about the 1910s-30s (and about today, too) by the emphasis it places on a narrative of historical rupture -- whether with the sinking of the *Titanic* or the onset of the First World War -- and on the increasing corruption of a once idyllic world.  This latter is most often exemplified by the dizzying number of financial scandals in which the characters become embroiled (including the Marconi Scandal, Teapot Dome, AND the original Ponzi scheme) and the increasingly fractious comingling of the classes that occurs as the seasons roll on.  By the time we've reached the current season, which has included references to the early triumph of Labour, the continuing collapse of the Raj in India, and the disastrous impact of the Beer Hall Putsch, the overarching narrative of decline and dissolution seems more pronounced than ever.  I'm told the sixth and final season will only go up to 1925, but I don't know how seriously to take that -- this seems like a story that needs to end in 1945 if it is to have any sort of "happy" ending, but I guess we'll see what Julian Fellowes has in mind.

All of which is to say, the talk is less about Downton itself than it is about the ways in which artists choose pieces of the past when crafting their art and what it does to the process of trying to understand the past (and art, at that).  Given that so many people seem to "learn" about history by reading fiction or watching television dramas, it would seem to be a perennial topic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Five points of insight into his method, if you're interested:

1. Not asking for money: he deflects the most common objection to street merchants by stating up front and loudly that he's not going to demand any money, and that is about to follow is simply a demonstration for interested parties.  This is what's known as a disarming tactic, and it helps ensure the crucial one or two initial observers who will make a crowd begin to form as the natural interest of the passer-by is piqued.  An additional help in his case is his age and (apparent) refinement; he says that he's offering the demonstration as "a courtesy" and so he does not have to yell.  This tugs jointly at nostalgia for more civilized times and at a sense of helpfulness due to the elderly.

2. The everyman: He immediately and consistently creates sympathy and fellow-feeling throughout the presentation by hitting the usual talking points, whether in disparaging politicians, denouncing cheap Chinese goods that don't deliver, or appealing to the widespread American interest in durable quality over cheap replaceability.  Certainly there are lots of Americans who don't have that value, but I feel confident in saying that you've probably seen it aggressively emphasized in lots of other sales pitches during your life.  An additional note that intrigued me: his emphasis on being able to make french fries in the (putatively) authentic French fashion is perfectly, **perfectly** ambiguous.  Someone well-disposed toward the French could hear it and be impressed; someone with anti-French feelings would find it a coded insult and be delighted that the salesman felt the same way.  There is nothing in what he says about this that demands one position or another -- it's left open for the buyer to fill.

3. "You can all do that": Taking the everyman appeal further, he frequently emphasizes that his product begins by enabling the inborn skills of everyone watching but concludes by elevating them beyond what they could previously do with the peelers they own.  This may seem like a small thing, but it creates a huge difference: "I *could* do that" gradually turns into "but I could also do *that*", and if that transition is an attractive one the audience-member wants to find a way to make that happen.  That's where the purchase of a peeler comes in.

4. "Pull the handle": In a yet further development of his everyman approach, at various points throughout the presentation he either calls on the audience to remember their own experiences or to participate in the one he is placing before them.  When the time comes for a demonstration, he deliberately chooses a hesitant-seeming woman to give it a try.  If she succeeds with the peeling immediately, perfect -- his patter has been vindicated.  If she has trouble, that also works -- he can say something fun ("I said it had to be hard, give it another go love") and then get the desired success anyway.  By getting people to identify with the process early on, they don't have to make any imaginative leap in buying the thing -- they're already "users."

5. The endgame: He begins by offering no discounts whatsoever.  The price is $5 for a stainless-steel peeler, but you're paying for quality so that's only to be expected.  He jokingly says you can get two for ten, and then four for twenty, and you can hear the ripple of laughter in the background -- this kind of joking wins people over.  The surprise of there actually being a discount at the purchase of four peelers is not meant to be his main price point, obviously -- any unit given away for free is a loss in pure monetary terms.  Nevertheless, it can create magnanimous faux-rich-people in the audience who really DO want to buy five, and this serves as an example for everyone else.

TL;DR: Here was a man who knew his business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yesterday saw me submit a proposal for a panel at the biggest conference in my field.  I presented a paper at it last year, when it was in Vancouver, and that was relatively easy to propose (even if it was a total surprise to me that THAT proposal got accepted); this time around, though, I've had to curate the proposals of several other people, and write what amounts to a 2500-word document to justify the whole thing.

I am hopeful that it gets accepted, but I and the rest of the panelists won't know until June, probably.  In the meantime, all thumbs are a-twiddle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a bit late on posting about this, but I'm still glad to see it: /r/WWI has risen from its initial obscurity to crack the 5000-subscriber mark.  I'm not completely sure, but I believe this may be the most-subscribed existing subreddit dedicated to a single war.  If there are any that are more popular, I have yet to find them (but would still be glad to learn of them!).

This is not the most active community on Reddit by a long shot, and I'd love to have more people here commenting and submitting and discussing things, but I am happy to speak for the rest of the mod team in saying that we are grateful to every one of you for being here, for reading, and for contributing when and what you can.

I'll admit there's been a bit of burn-out on my end when it comes to doing much of anything online, but I'd like to start contributing more here in the near future.  With that in mind, what sort of features or other things would you like to see in /r/WWI that don't already exist?  We used to have open discussion threads once a week -- we could do so again.  But what else?

In any event, thank you once again for being here.  These rolling centenary years have provided an unprecedented wealth of material and debate where the war is concerned, and I'm very grateful to all of you for being here with us to consider it. </TEXT>

We learn from this account that the Devil "was in a bind because he was way behind, and willing to make a deal."  It has not come down to us exactly why the Prince of Lies could ever have fallen behind his own schedule, or what schedule that even was in the first place, but certainly this willingness to gamble the souls of men on trivial events is totally in keeping with the character of Old Nick.

	<TEXT> I'm sorry I missed this!  

It's a remarkable strip, and very well-liked by many in the world of First World War studies.  I assume you're looking at [this recent Titan Books reprint](http://www.amazon.ca/Charleys-War-Boy-Soldier-Great/dp/1781169144/ref=sr_1_2) that's been made widely available (but do correct me if I'm wrong!).  It's a great starting point for the series as a whole, which currently runs to some ten hardcover volumes; this one collects most of volumes 1 through 4.

The series is very "realistic" in its depictions of how appalling conditions in the trenches and how chaotic such combat could be, and it is very much focused on the experience of the regular fighting man rather than the wider geopolitical ramifications of everything.  It's one of the very few comic strips I've ever heard of to have been given an official research budget, in any event, so I hope that gives you some impression of how seriously Mills and Colquhoun took their business.  Still, it's very much a part of the long-established "mud, blood, and futility" school of First World War works, so take that for whatever it may mean to your father.

In short, I would very happily recommend it, and also very happily own it.  Another such work that might be very much looking into is Jacques Tardi's *It Was the War of the Trenches* and *Goddamn This War!*, both of which are amazing and both of which have recently been republished (and translated into English) in a handsome two-volume hardcover.

I do not really recommend Joe Sacco's *The Great War*, but it's still an impressive work for all its flaws. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see you're skeptical.  The other people you've asked to explain this to you in this way have all failed, and I have to admit to feeling a certain strong impulse not to end up as a pile of ashes on the ground like they have.

There's a problem with Shakespeare: everyone seems to have at least heard of *some* of the plays, but those plays are all the same.  You've gone through four people so far and all they could do was try to give you fake impressions of the same old stuff:  *Romeo   Juliet*, *Hamlet*, *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, and so on.  Everyone knows about them, but they don't help *you*.  I think I can, though, and if you'll hold off with that blaster for a few minutes I'll tell you why.

Let me tell you about a man named Caius Martius.

He may not have been an actual historical figure, though the play I'm talking about is often grouped with Shakespeare's "history plays."  He seems to have been a pious Roman myth designed to show some important problem of statecraft being encountered and then, arguably, solved.  The solution isn't the most elegant, but that in itself is a lesson.  Not everything can be as tidy as fiction would have it, and this play -- like the story on which it is based -- does not pretend anything to the contrary.

If you read Shakespeare's *Tragedy of Coriolanus*, you will see an expansive treatise on what it means to rule.  How is society to be ordered?  What place should each individual have in that process, and should any regard be paid to how influential they are, how intelligent they are, how accomplished they are, how wealthy they are?  Does the inheritance of blood matter?  Or can a man make himself into something important by the pure force of his will?  Must the few bow to the many?  Must the many be dominated by the few?  Or is it possible to strike some nobler balance between these interests, that we might have cage next to cage without crows and eagles forever trying to peck at one another?

There is sex and violence both in the play, but not in the ways you might think.  Caius Martius scarcely cares about his wife, and seems dead to any of the temptations of the flesh; he and his men also kill, and are killed, but all of this is done in service of a higher ideal and with an expectation of responsibility.  All wantonness of flesh and blood is overthrown, and we are left, in the end, with a protagonist who shows the best that humanity has to offer: a brain, and a will, that have been given a body to move them around -- and not the reverse.

**"Any race that could produce such a work is too dangerous to live."**

Well, it's a fair cop.  You know I had to try, tho-- </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "You need to be careful with that one," said the chief ninja.  He set a manilla folder on the desk in front of him and folded his hands.  The encounter was already going differently than Steve had anticipated when the trio of black-clad warriors had first burst through the window.  He put down the curtain rod and pulled out a chair across from the leader.

"Who do you mean?" Steve asked.

"Cindy Horton.  You were just speaking to her on the telephone, Steve."

"But how could you know..."

"We are ninjas, Steve," he said with a curt gesture; "we know everything."  He tapped the folder in front of him.  "Sometimes we share what we know."

"What's this about Cindy, then?"

"She is trouble, Steve.  Trouble you do not need.  I have the relevant documents here" -- he gestured vaguely at the folder -- "but let it suffice to say that your plan to ask her out to a movie tomorrow night should not be carried out."

"How--"

"Ninjas, Steve."

"What do you mean, she's trouble?  She's just a pretty, sweet, funny, normal girl."

The chief ninja cleared his throat.

"*Generally* normal," he said, darkly.

"What do you mean?"

"I have affidavits here from the last three men she has dated that all point to a pattern of emotional manipulation, a hair-trigger sense of self-importance, and" -- he flipped through some pages -- "a terrible taste in films."

"How... right, ninjas."  Steve rubbed his eyes resignedly.  "Why are you telling me all of this?"

"We do not choose to share every detail at this time," said the chief ninja.  "But I will say that we are motivated by a spirit of public improvement."

Steve glanced at the other ninjas, who were examining his family photographs with an air of detached boredom.

"What you say about Cindy doesn't seem all that bad, though," said Steve.  "We all have our problems, and I'm not worried about the movie thing very much."

The chief ninja sighed.

"There is more, Steve."  He opened the folder again.  "In the third grade she stole the class guinea pig to take home, and was subsequently so embarrassed that she 'set it free' in the field behind her house.  It was killed within minutes.  In the sixth grade she was caught with a jar of nasal mucus that she had been collecting for years.  She still has not gotten rid of the jar.  Since February of 2010 there has been another jar, in which she collects her used tampons.  We have photographs, if..."

Steve turned pale.

"We also have transcripts of the conversations she has online under the name candygrrltrap6969.  Would you like to see them?"

Steve shook his head.  He stared downward at his hands.

"No, that's... that's enough."

The chief ninja returned the folder to his briefcase and flicked a piece of lint from his shozoku.  His colleagues made their way to the broken window.

"Then our business is concluded.  If you have any further questions, here is my calling card."  He withdrew a short length of silk rope from the briefcase, entwined around a single water-lily.  Steve accepted it hesitantly.

"What, uh--"

"When you have need of it, Steve," said the chief ninja, "you will know."

The three black-clad public servants slipped silently through the window. 

"Thanks, ninjas!" Shouted Steve as he raced to watch them go; "I'll never forget you!"  He thought he caught the faintest hint of a wave as the last of them vanished across the roof of Mrs. Podeski's garage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I've tried it at least a hundred times.

Nothing fucking worked.

Do you know how little time three minutes actually is?  Maybe it sounds like a lot, I don't know.  It's the length of a typical song, for starters, and just a bit longer than a typical movie trailer.  It's longer than almost anyone can hold his breath.  It's also about the length of time that someone can engage in an otherwise un-stimulating task without his mind wondering irrevocably.

Three minutes, in short, is not a lot of time.

The first time I tried it, it was basically like having a bad case of *deja vu*.  Everything was the same, everything was expected, everything was totally non-consequential.  I was still in my bedroom, still listening to Sufjan Stevens, still sitting across from the dumb-looking hourglass.  I had been there before.  Nothing was surprising.  I waited for something interesting to happen, but it never did.

And then, after maybe two minutes and fifty-five seconds, there was this weird pulsing flash and I was right back where I started -- holding the hourglass in my hand, just listening to the end of "Chicago" while trying to decide if I should turn the damned thing over.

Several more attempts confirmed it: unless my actions in the "new past" (I have to call it that, or something; this is all fucking new) led to me turning the hourglass in the last few seconds of those three minutes, it would spring me back to where I was and erase everything that happened.  Time does not like to be fucked with, and the hourglass seems to be a bad lay to begin with.

It's very hard to do anything meaningful in three minutes.  Believe me, I've tried.  You can maybe win an eBay auction with a slightly lower bid.  You can not get hit by a car.  You can revise and revise your conversations so that you're brilliant rather than a damned fool.  The problem is that you have to be doing all of these things already when you turn the goddamn hourglass (three-minute-glass?), and it can take a lot of doing to get you to those points.  I sure managed to make *some* stuff happen, but three minutes is *not a lot of time*.  None of it ended up being all that helpful, and the requirement that the last few seconds involve turning the hourglass anyway have created a really pressing obstacle.

The most disconcerting part of the whole experiment was where I tried to turn the thing after driving to a convenience store to buy a lottery ticket.  I turned the glass and was then suddenly driving again without expecting it.  I went off the road, crashed into a ravine, and started to burn alive.  It hurts, in case you're wondering -- but it took more than three minutes to kill me, so I just ended up back where I started again.  I'm never going to forget that feeling, though.  I don't know how anyone could.

Anyway, to cut a long story short, *fuck this hourglass*.  Thirty minutes would have been workable; even ten would have given me *something*.  As it is, I just want to chuck the thing into the nearest lake and be done with it.

In case you were counting, all of this took me exactly two minutes and fifty seconds to speak into the recorder.  Time will only tell if </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The library was easy.  

So much has been automated now that I managed to get in and out without interacting with anything more sentient than a computer.  I typed in what I was after, found it on the appropriate shelf, and then checked it out using the automated kiosk.  I swear, that machine printing the return-by slip was louder than anything I did while I was there.  It was worth it, though; I could never memorize a quote as long as the one James had requested, so I needed to read it from the source.

Dinner was... interesting.  Have you ever pretended to be a mute?  I never had, before tonight, and I can't even imagine how offended people must have been by the grotesque parody I offered.  The waiters were just irritated, but mom and dad looked like they were ready to put me in the ground next to James.  When I thanked the waiter with a mimed gesture of prayer, I think I heard my mother choke down some vomit.  Just like me to pull a ridiculous joke at a time like this, right?  Well, I can't blame them for thinking that; I wasn't talking.

The funeral begins in fifteen minutes, and I hope whoever ends up reading this will say a prayer for me.  I'll be dead.  There's no other possibility once this shit hits the fan.  

I'll be fine for the first half, but the eulogy is going to be a *bitch*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a great post, and I applaud its appearance here.

I will say, though, that in spite of Edmonds' biases, his omnipresence in works of this sort is somewhat unavoidable.  As the guiding editor and frequent author of the volumes comprising the British *Official History*, he had a hand in many of the sources that are now considered indispensable, and it is not at all surprising to see him cited so frequently.  This likely stands as a data point in the dispute over the advisability of citing "official histories" in the first place, but that's a whole other argument.

Anyway, this is good stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As /u/DuxBelisarius below has noted, I've had cause to cover a similar question before -- [you may find it useful](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1z7sc1/why_did_the_great_war_produce_so_many/cfriz7e).

In the meantime, Dux's timeframe is fairly accurate.  While Owen and Rosenberg remained fairly obscure for decades, poets like Sassoon and Graves were well known even during the war itself and capitalized on this fame in its aftermath.  1922 saw the publication of C.E. Montague's *Disenchantment*, a novel-essay that paved the way for the great "War Books Boom" of 1927-33.  It was during that period that the kind of viewpoints that have become so dominant about the war were given their most exuberant voices; the period saw the publication of Hemingway's *Farewell to Arms*, Remarque's *All Quiet*, Graves' *Good-Bye to All That*, Sassoon's *Memoirs of an Infantry Officer*, Blunden's *Undertones of War*, Brittain's *Testament of Youth*, etc., and such works -- along with the "disillusioned" poetry that so echoed their sentiments -- swept the field.

Owen and Rosenberg's rise to popularity in the 1960s was due as much to rediscovery as to repopularization -- on Owen's part, at least -- by Sir Benjamin Britten.  His *War Requiem* took Owen's poetry as the substantive basis of its text, and the young poet's songs of protest found many willing ears in the ferment of the rising 1960s counter-culture.  They've attained a supremacy rare in any field, and only slightly eroded in recent years by attempts to examine other areas of the canon (women's poetry, civilian poetry generally, "patriotic" poetry, etc.).

Anyway, more details on all of that are available at the link above! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excellent!  I'm very glad to hear that.  Sad as it is to say, my work schedule has made it hard for me to spare time for much reading beyond fairly slim volumes, so this one's congenial slenderness called out to me as much as the imprint did.  I'll make sure it gets a place in the imminent rotation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. In the last 48 hours I've received the proofs for my latest article and also news that a conference I attended last summer will be developed into not one but two volumes in Palgrave Macmillan's *Languages at War* series.  It's a good thing I enjoy writing, because it seems like I'll never get to do anything else __

2. A **question for scholars of the early Americas and/or the Columbian Exchange**: What is the reputation of J.H. Elliott's *The Old World and the New* (1970)?  I picked up a copy for a dollar at a library sale the other day, purely on the strength of it being in Cambridge's *Canto* series. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thankful to /u/elos_ for alerting me to this thread!  I'd be happy to delve into this matter a bit further, but I'd like to ask you to expand a bit on what it is you're after with this question.  How best might I answer it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That it is, at least at the post-doctoral level.  The day has ended here with no mail, too, so it looks like I get to sit tight until Monday :/

As one wag on the academic jobs wiki noted, "wine with lunch helps." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So no, they didn't just 'tip the first domino' over; they set it on fire and launched it over the Belgian border.

And then papered Belgium with posters assuring the Belgian people that the flaming dominos were only being aimed to intercept secret French dominos who had been illegally crossing the southern Belgian border in disguise via motor-car, and that the Belgian people need not put out the flaming dominos if they happened to land on their property since they had been fired in the spirit of genial friendship.  And any attempt to put them out would be viewed as an act of unprovoked hostility and would result in the just and total wrath of a vengeful Germany, with not one Belgian stone left atop another. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The results of one of the larger research grant competitions in Canada were apparently sent out today, so there are hundreds of us eagerly awaiting the sound of the mailman -- if only to have our hopes dashed for another year, or to have to suddenly start planning to move to a different city or something in the fall.

The granting agency's office is only a five-minute walk from my apartment, but I still have to wait on the mail.  This is going to be a rough weekend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would be interested in seeing your take on those errors in detail, if you have some time to outline them.  His work is often recommended to those who are interested in approaching the bunking/debunking dispute in First World War studies for the first time, and I've been having qualms with its popularity even as I've groped around for a similarly accessible volume. </TEXT>
