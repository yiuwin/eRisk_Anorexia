If it's lower, I may as well have snorted some coke because I am HIGH ON LIFE if I weigh less.

	<TEXT> Yeah my mom's food is the one thing I'll never throw away. Because one day I *might* eat it (no plans in the near future tbh) and her food is sentimental more than anything. She puts so much time and love into her food. She cooked it all for me while she was visiting me, when she could have been out doing things with her boyfriend instead!

I wish I could somehow fit it into my calorie budget, even if it's only a few spoonfuls. But I literally have no idea what the calorie count would be. She doesn't use measuring tools really (her idea of a tablespoon is a large soup spoon lol). The basmati rice is the only thing I'd be able to measure out and calculate the calories. I mean I guess I could weigh the total amount of potato curry and figure out how many calories come from the potato, but for oil, garlic, ginger, etc I'd have *no* idea. She used coconut oil **and** vegetable oil to make it!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's triggering your binges? Do your restrict too low to start with? When I used to binge it would be because I'd restrict myself way too much during the day, come home from school and be ravenous. I'd eat whatever was binge-able. My mentality was always "I'll try again tomorrow." Then I'd restrict myself the next day, become absolutely ravenous and eat everything all over again. It was a horrible cycle and I ended up gaining *so much* weight. Just try to remind yourself the next time you want to binge, how it'll read on the scale in the future.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, it's all about the scale. I discussed this in someone's else thread. I woke up feeling relatively slim today. I had 390 calories yesterday so I hoped the scale would reflect that. But the scale read .4 *higher* yesterday. It's quite literally impossible for me to have gained almost half a pound overnight, especially considering I only ate 390 calories the day before. But after that scale reading, I felt huge. That scale reading means nothing in the grand scheme of things. But the number itself indicates how I feel throughout the day. I feel fat and disgusting today. On the flip side, if the scale read .4 pounds *lighter*, I would feel beautiful and thin. I look in the mirror and see fat everywhere. But if the scale reading was lower, I would probably think I look slimmer whenever I look in the mirror. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I just want to be underweight. When I was diagnosed with anorexia as a teenager, my BMI (based on the "old" formula) was between 17.4 and 16.4 (my mom took my scale away at 17.4 and I lost ~5 pounds after she took it away making it 16.4). So my lowest was ~87. My goal weight is 85 just because I want a new low weight. Of course I'd love to go even lower but I doubt I'd be able to continue riding if I got lower. But we'll see how I feel once I reach my goal! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can gain up to 5% of your body weight during your period so don't worry about it! Your BMR is different from your TDEE so as long as you eat less than you TDEE, you will lose weight. Based on your stats I'd imagine 1400 is way below your TDEE. Your body is probably not used to the 1400 calories you had so it'll take time for that 1400 calories of water weight to die down. Once your period ends you should be going back to losing steadily. Try not to worry too much about it! Trust me, I know it's easier said than done. I had 390 calories yesterday and I'm up .4 pounds this morning! Just remind yourself it'll all even out eventually.  </TEXT>

We were 3 months into dating and he said something about my weight followed by, "You don't want to be a size 8 forever" (I was 15-20 pounds heavier back then). It triggered the fuck out of me and prompted me to break up with him. Funny how something weight related made me break up with him but not the fact he fucking raped me.

	<TEXT> And by *you* I mean *me*. 

I had 1 cup of soup for dinner on Sunday and 1 cup last night. Yesterday morning I was down .8 pounds but this morning I'm UP .4 pounds! I drank a ton of water last night (64 oz to be exact) and took a diuretic and peed like a dozen times before I went to bed to balance the sodium from the soup but it failed. Gahhh I feel like shit. I had a feeling this would happen which is why I put off having soup for so long, but I'm not grocery shopping until all my safe foods are gone and soup ~~is~~ was one of my safe foods. I'm never having soup again...despite how delicious and low cal it is. 

Overused Seinfeld quotes aside, I'm really upset about my weight being up today! I know it's water weight because there's literally no way I gained almost half a pound by eating 390 calories yesterday. But still. I was so motivated after seeing the scale read 116.6 yesterday and I really want to hit 115 by Monday! I think I might fast one or two days this week to make it happen. 500 calories seems too high for me to eat, but if I can hit that calorie goal, I might try to workout a little bit today as well. It was rainy and windy yesterday so I couldn't go on a run but today seems pretty okay. Oh, and I'm riding today so that'll help.  </TEXT>

If you don't have bulking goals but are an athlete, I'd imagine you'd need more protein than that though, right? Because you're constantly straining your muscles and would need a bit more protein to repair your muscles after participating in the sport? </TEXT>

IDK in the past whenever I'd talk to my therapist about even just going vegetarian (for moral purposes, not to restrict my diet) she would say things like "I think you need to be a little more recovered to do that" etc. But then there was this one girl in my eating disorder recovery group who (no judgement) was still emaciated from anorexia raving about HCLF raw veganism...Call me crazy but I feel like weight restoration is something that should be done *before* someone changes their diet to something extreme and super restrictive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you're experiencing is bradycardia (low heart rate). I experience the other extreme, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), when I've been restricting/fasting. Either of these things are very common with restrictive type eating disorders. Since you are not getting the nourishment your body needs, your heart needs to work harder to keep you alive, therefore the irregular heartbeat. In your case, I'd say your heart is not functioning properly and is having a very very difficult time maintaining a normal heart rate. In theory, yes, you should be concerned. Irregular heartbeats should not be taken lightly. But, truthfully and unfortunately, with eating disorders come the stupid ability to ignore signals your body gives you that something is wrong. Really, the only fix for this (as far as I know) is to stop restricting/fasting. </TEXT>

I mean I feel like it's counter productive and also it's basically trading one food-related obsession for another?

	<TEXT> Oh my goodness I thought I was one of the few people on this sub who felt this way. I've recently reached a grey area in my eating disorder where on one hand, my ED has gotten *so* bad. In the past when I'd restrict, I'd still go out with friends and eat normally and have a "fuck it" mentality, then go back to restricting the next day. But I'm at a point where I refuse to see my friends all together because, food. On the other hand, I can finally see how badly I need help and how this will literally kill me if I don't stop. But I'm so stuck between the two. 

Before I relapsed, I tried to lose weight the healthy way. But it triggered me to go back to ED behaviors and here I am. It's a lose lose situation all around. Maybe seeing a therapist will help you? Even if you're not committed to recovery, it might still be helpful to have 1 hour a week where you can totally speak your mind to another person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was thinking about something similar to this last night. Specifically, I was thinking about all the times people would tell me "just eat!" or "why don't you just eat healthy if you want to lose weight?" My response in my head is, well, if I *could* just eat healthy, don't you think I would? It's not like I enjoy isolating myself and being hungry and starved and emotionally fucked, just to see the number on the scale go down. If I could just eat, then I absolutely would. But I can't! I want to eat. I want to be normal. But my ED brain won't let me and it's really fucking awful. Plus, before my relapse, I *did* try to lose weight the healthy way and it just triggered me to go back to eating disordered behaviors. So clearly it's a much more complex problem than simply refusing to eat healthily.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So as some of you may know based on my previous posts and comments, my mom and her boyfriend visited me 2 weekends ago (April 7-10) then the following weekend (April 15-17) I went out of town with them. I definitely gained weight between April 7 and 10 so I fasted and restricted until my trip with them on the 15th. I weighed myself the day I departed for my trip and I was around 120 or 121, meaning 1-2 pounds heavier than I was before they visited. I didn't weigh myself after my trip because I knew I'd cry at the number (I figured it would be around 125 with water weight and possible real weight gain) and have just been fasting and restricting since Monday. 

I wasn't going to weigh myself until Friday since I'm on my period, but this morning I bit the bullet and stepped on the scale. I thought I'd be 120 at the *least* but the scale read 117.4! Holy crap! I'm so happy! And this is considering I'm still slightly on my period! That means I'm ~6 pounds away from my lowest adult weight. Now I really wish I had weighed myself after my trip to see the progress and how much I actually lost in 6 days. Oh well. I'm just so happy! I still have a *loooooong* way to go until I reach my lowest weight ever (which was between 87 and 92 when I was 14 years old) but this is so motivating. 

Knowing this, I'm going to set myself a very conservative goal of reaching 115 by Monday May 2nd, however I reckon I'll be in the 114's. This also means, if my calculations are correct, I'll be under 100 pounds by the time of this wedding I've been invited to. Wow. 

On the downside, I hate how much my mom's visit and going out of town stalled my weight loss. I was 119 on April 6 and I'm 117.4 on April 24. I could be like 110 by now had that visit and trip not happened.  </TEXT>

Unless you have a major medical issue (which you should see your doctor for asap to get checked out) I don't see how it's possible for you to not be loosing even on 600 calories a day. Are you eating foods high in sodium? That may not cause weight gain/maintenance but it definitely causes water retention. </TEXT>

When I started riding I flopped around on a horse once a week, then a year and a half later I bought my own horse and we go to big shows. It's incredible. Seriously. Start the archery!!!

I like white wines which I think are 120 calories per 5 oz? I could be wrong. 

Aw I'm sorry your mom is leaving you!! But on the bright side, think of all the amazing wine she can make if she does move to a vineyard in Napa. Holy crap. But you are seriously so lucky that you have your mom living with you, making you all the wine you could ever want.  </TEXT>

You know what, I may not go to the gym anymore but I still ride my horse 4 times a week. That burns anywhere between 200 and 400 calories. Meaning, I could *probably* get away with a glass or two of wine on days I ride!

	<TEXT> Regarding reading, I actually started reading a book on my plane ride and I've totally forgotten about it! I'll definitely revisit it. It might be hard to focus on the text with so little food but maybe I'll make myself a cup of tea while I read. 

Your idea of knitting sparked my memory of when I used to make those string friendship bracelets. I'll try to stop by the store this weekend and buy some string. Actually I might have some already...

My friends are so stressful. I really only have 2 friends and both of them know about my ED and my relapse, so it'll be hard to see them without food being involved. Plus one of them is out of the country for the next month so that really limits socializing for me.

Thank you so much for all of the suggestions!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I quoted myself because you kept asking the same question when I've already answered it. 

Think of it this way. Many people with eating disorders have a fascination with thinness. We see hip bones, collar bones, rib cages, etc. to be really, really beautiful, when the general population probably doesn't think a skeletal person looks beautiful. We want to share our fascination with a skeletal physique with others since most people in our lives would be disgusted if we told them "bones are beautiful". And that's what this sub can be used for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We all struggle with eating disorders and this is our only outlet, our own way to cope.

In addition, get support from others when it comes to the unhealthy behaviors we engage in. We ask others if they've experienced things similar to what we're going through. Eating disorders, as you must know, are very lonely disorders. We are not ready to recover and it kind of gives us hope and allows to feel less lonely knowing there are others going through what we're going through.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've found myself in a predicament where I have...nothing to do. I'm in school Monday-Thursday and I get home from campus at around 4:30pm. I don't have homework or studying to do every night so 3 out of 4 school nights leave me with at least 5 hours of nothingness. Mostly I just browse Reddit with the TV on as background noise and shower at some point. On the weekends it's even worse. I have maybe 2 hours max of homework for the *whole* weekend and I ride my horse. I ride earlier in the day meaning I'm back home no later than 1pm. That leaves me with at least 9 hours of nothing to do. 

Lately I've been fasting a lot and restricting to under 300 calories a day, so it doesn't leave me with much energy to workout, especially if I've ridden earlier in the day. I have TV shows I'm behind on but my depression has gotten the worst of me and I have no interest in those shows anymore. Seeing friends is out of the question because I refuse to be around unsafe foods. I kind of wish my house was messy right now because it's a big house and it would take all day to clean, but it's really organized and spotless. 

To top it off, the semester ends in a few weeks so I'll have periods of days where I'm doing absolutely nothing. There's this movie theatre nearby that sells tickets to all movies for $5 on Tuesdays. I've been thinking about adding that once a week but even smelling popcorn is so terrifying. I feel like I'm inhaling calories (so stupid, I know). Any ideas for me? I'm totally out of ideas.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yo, I was literally just thinking about this yesterday. I haven't weighed myself since *last* Thursday because I went out of town Friday-Sunday and put on water weight and probably some real weight. I decided I'd fast and restrict all week to get rid of the weight I gained over that weekend trip and weigh myself on Friday. But then on Wednesday I got my period! So I knew my scheduled Friday weigh-in would be an inaccurate/water weight ridden reading. So I've decided I'm going to put my weigh-in off for another week. 

I've been restricting and fasting consistently since Monday and I have no intention to stop. I know logically I've lost weight, but not knowing the number makes me feel fat, despite being able to feel and see my ribs better than I've been able to in over a year. By the time I weigh myself next Friday, I'll have lost even more weight. So up until the second I step on the scale, I'm going to feel fat. But once I get the reading and see it's way lower, I'll feel skinny. Like, flip of a switch my body perception will change. It's such a mindfuck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I'm this way when I'm fasting. The first 24 hours are the worst, then my mood stabilizes the following day. The only fix to this I have is trying to limit my social interactions. Even getting texts and Facebook notifications really irritates me during the first 24 hours of a fast. I don't know why, I guess it's just because I don't have the energy to deal with people and I'd rather be left totally alone to endure my fast.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 800 calories per day is less than the recommended 1000-1200 minimum for women so I'm sure those 200 calories you're missing has had an effect. Especially if long-term you've been doing this. If you are really concerned and think it may be non-diet related, maybe ask your doctor. 

I find that coffee makes fasting so much easier. However, I've abused coffee a bit too much so I'm trying to stay away from it for a while haha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't experienced that exactly with my period, but any relatively long term restricting and fasting (malnourishment really) can definitely cause period issues. But are you sure it was a period and not just spotting? In the past, even before I got to my lowest weight/underweight, I had been restricting for several months and I got my period as scheduled, but then 2 weeks later I got a full period again.

Have you tried fasting to help your weight pudge? There will be days where I'm stuck at the same exact weight (down the the fraction of a pound) for 3 days. I fast for 24-36 hours then weight loss resumes. Lately I've been getting plateaus a lot, despite eating under 500 calories, so I have to fast 2-3 times a week to get the scale moving. </TEXT>
