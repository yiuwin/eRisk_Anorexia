	<TEXT> You're welcome! Keep your head up and stay strong. One day you'll look back and realize how far you've come and then realize how strong and awesome you truly are. That is *totally* worth fighting for. 

Keep on keepin' on! Good internet vibes and happy thoughts and stuff!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stay strong. It's okay to realize things are fucking hard right now instead of pretending everything is okay. Itty bitty baby steps at first. When you feel comfortable with that take a good step outside your comfort zone again. Eventually you'll realize that you're running and taking the world by storm and nothing can hold you down. 

Don't give up on yourself. No matter what you are feeling right now, you have no idea how great you can be, and you owe it to yourself and the world to see how bad ass that truly is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have one of those in Mom form. I'm in the process of moving out, but I almost never see her anymore because I'm always staying with a friend or working in another city. The best thing ever is not having to see or talk to that person every single day. I've decided that I get to choose my family rather than being born into one. My family consists of My awesome Father, my bad ass sister, and my two best friends. My mom only birthed me, and that's about the only significance she has to me. It sounds cold and calloused but an unhealthy influence deserves to be cut out of your life no matter who they are/were to you. 

Keep your head up. This is one situation where "It gets better" applies. You are better than the abuse that you receive never *ever* forget that. You don't deserve it no matter who you are or what you've done. You won't have to deal with that shit forever and you'll be a better person because of it. Sending lots of happy thoughts and good vibes and stuff!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **1.** Figure out your *"lifeline"*. It doesn't have to be huge or grandiose, just important to you. When I was depressed the only thing that kept me alive was knowing that there were 3 people that loved me even though I completely ignored them and was a total asshole to them for 6+ months -- they still loved me. I knew that no matter what, there will always be 3 things in my life that are still good and that was enough for me to hold on to in my darkest moments.

**2.** Set goals. I'm not talking "save the planet and make a fortune goals" I'm talking:

* Take a shower.

* Try to my best eat to breakfast.

* Take a 10 minute walk outside.

These are the things that will give your day to day life *purpose*. Write them down if you have to! The point of this is so that you don't lay around chain smoking cigarettes and weed and playing video games for 15+hours a day for 6 months straight. For the longest time I never set any goals and the only reason why I got up in the morning was to load another bowl -- not a healthy goal.

**3.** Volunteer. It doesn't matter if it is for 30 minutes or for a few hours. Bonus points if it is something that you care about. I'm really passionate about education and youth empowerment so I volunteered to read 1:1 with some Kindergarten-2nd grade kids at the local elementary schools. I hated myself and everything about my shitty and meaningless life, but seeing those kids faces light up when they saw me walk in to read with them *actually* made me smile. Giving your time away is the *best* thing that you could possibly ever do for yourself. If you can't find anything to volunteer for there is always need at your local Homeless Shelter. Those people can give 40+ hours of volunteer work if ask for it, and you are making a huge difference in other peoples lives too.

**4.** Do the small things. When you walk past a mirror try to smile at yourself. When you eat breakfast who gives a fuck if it is unhealthy waffles and nutella slathered in syrup is my goddamn favorite food. Have a favorite outfit that makes you feel awesome? Wear that son of a bitch, who cares if you aren't going out today! Time to suit up mother fuckers!

These are the four major things that helped me the most. **1.) Figure out your lifeline. 2.) Set small daily goals. The more the better. 3.) Volunteer. Giving your time away is the best thing that you can do for yourself and other people. 4.) Do the small things that used to make you happy.** 

People say "one day at a time" but that was too much for me. Take it one step at a time. Try your best to stay sober. Shoot a text to someone that loves you and compliment them -- no need for a conversation, that's enough. Take care of yourself: shower, brush your teeth, clean your face, etc.. 

This post ended up being a lot longer than I intended, so I'm sorry for writing a novel. If you or anyone ever needs to talk feel free to PM me. It can feel cathartic to just have someone listen to you. 

The last thing that I can't stress enough is that you aren't alone. What you are feeling lots of other people feel for no good reason. You aren't pathetic, you're awesome. One more time because it is so incredibly important:

**YOU ARE NOT ALONE.**

Edit: Holy crap! My first gold ever!! Thank you kind stranger! You totally made my night!! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alrighty, *here's the deal.*

Sexuality needs to stop fitting in a single rigid box. Sexuality can be all kinds of fluid and you are only oppressing yourself by making yourself stick into one itty-bitty box. Don't give a *fuck* what people will think about your Sexual Orientation and Sexual Preference. I identify as "Gay" and *definitely* not Bisexual, but sometimes having sex with women can be a good time even though for the most part I prefer other men. I'm not lying to other people because they don't get to dictate or hold me accountable for what I want to do with my body and who I'm attracted to at any single point and time. If people have a problem that I identify as gay but occasionally have coitus related activities with a woman they can go fuck themselves -- oppressive bastards.

Most of my posts are about how people should love themselves no matter what because I truly believe the human experience is all kinds of crazy and beautiful and we limit ourselves too much by societal constraints. Overall I just want to convey a message of **There is NOTHING wrong with the way you feel. Just roll with it and be the happiest that you can be. Relationships and crap like that will fall in line when you love yourself for who you really are and not because of a stupid meaningless title that we try to put on ourselves and other people.**

Feel free to PM or whatever if you ever want to talk about it with someone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a day late to the thread and no one will read this, so I might as well piggy back off the top comment. First.) I agree with a lot in this thread: A class is *definitely* not the way to go about it.. especially in an institution like Harvard. No matter who you are you are probably close to someone that went to Harvard and more than likely have shit tons of money. And this comment is right, this just spotlights people that aren't traditionally privileged. A classroom isn't how you do this, probably like an open forum discussion where people can choose to attend or not. I'm not sure of an alternative, but a classroom setting is a bad way to do it.

But, Second.) This thread *really* frustrates me because it takes one extreme presented in this article and swings it in the opposite extreme. Checking your privilege is something that's important to do (and I am a white, middle class, male to be clear). I'm also gay, so I can talk about the ever present subtle homophobia in popular culture that you really only impacts someone if that are gay (I have no place to talk about race because I got the good end of the stick with my skin color). 

Third.) Here are my experiences with subtle homophobia in popular culture:

 **1.)** Remember in school when you had to fill out a family tree and there was a designated place for a Mom and a Dad? Very small things like this is ever-present in education and it taught me that the way that I feel isn't "normal". I learned about heterosexual couples in school from science to English to History to small projects like this in elementary school. There is no *explicit* "Being gay is bad" but rather by extreme omission it is very easy to internalize those feelings. I never learned about gay activists and the names like *Harvey Milk* or *Doris Fish* or *The Mattachine Society*. LGBTQ+ rights are completely ignored in school. :(

 **2.)** The majority of Disney movies antagonist (bad guy) is nearly always some sort of gender-bender? Think about it. Aladdin, you get Jaffar (sp? w/e), Little Mermaid, you get the evil butch scary octopus lady (while all other women are very small, petite, and feminine). In Pocahontas, you get that weird short fat dude that always caries around a pug (which even the invading white men turn on.. so he is portrayed remarkably evil). I will admit that it has gotten *better* but instances like this still exist even in cartoons prevalent today. Breaking traditional gender performance is *evil*. 

**3.** This part is the iffy-est due to consumer demographics. There are very few movies, books, and popular songs that really ever touch on Gay issues. Sure you have pop icons like Lady Gaga but she is a phenomenon. Most of the time if gay issues are mentioned it is made fun of, like:*"I Kissed a Girl*. Once again, this is the omission part. The firs time I ever heard a song (by an all gay punk band, no less) that was a dude singing about being attracted to other dudes it threw me into a little bit of an existential crisis because I've *never* heard same sex attraction sang about the same way normal love songs sing about heterosexual relationships.

I can keep going but my point is: **Prolonged silence and omission can be just as oppressive as someone yelling "Faggot!" down the street.** This is what "Checking your privilege" is about to me: Realizing that sometimes racism, sexism, homophobia is presented in nearly subconscious and subtle ways that it is hard to notice if it doesn't directly impact you (Hence why I have no right to talk about Race, Patriarchy, Classism, etc.. because I got the good end of the stick.. ) I'm just sometimes not aware of the implications of my actions even though I *never ever* intend it to be negative or oppressive -- it doesn't mean that it *can't* be negative or oppressive. 

So.. uhh... Check your privilege you racists, homophobic, patriarchal bigots, you! #r/SRS!! (/sarcasm if no one got that...) (but seriously, it is important to critically examine your actions and sometimes just to sit down and listen to what someone has to say about something that doesn't always pertain to you. Don't be offended, it's not your fault. Just take it in stride as a potential learning opportunity.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I'm most interested in is the point where you realized that a non-binary system wasn't for you. I want to write about that initial "Oh shit.. I don't have to be like everyone else" moment.

 I can feel comfortable identifying with the gender assigned to me at birth (male) about 70% of the time, but I've never been comfortable *performing* as a traditionally masculine male. My "oh shit" moment was when I read Alan Downs "Velvet Rage" and realized that I've internalized a lot of hate towards other feminine gay men because I was really uncomfortable with that part of myself. Since then I've used mostly academic literature to self actualize and become comfortable performing my identity the was I see fit (however difficult and arduous that journey has been for me).

So: What prompted you to begin the conscious sustained working-at-it part? And what has (if anything) been your main inspiration (for lack of a better word) to find and be comfortable with your own identity? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as general thesis of what I'm using from Foucault is where he talks about sexuality not being a natural phenomenon, but rather one that is a social construction. Sexuality isn't an intrinsic part of the human identity, it is more of a piece of personal property that we hold inside of us rather than it originating from within us. Much like how he describes gender, it isn't something that is tangible and discernible it's just -- *there*.

Mostly he talks about the societal implications of sexual power rather than the production of sexuality which I'm very interested in, but for the reasons of this paper I probably won't be getting into much. 

I just read through Jasbir Puar's wikipedia and the referenced articles (however paltry that is for an introduction of her), I'm really really interested in that. The same way that I'm more interested in the implications of sexuality that Foucault talks about rather than the production of sexuality, I can't really include her in what I'm writing this for, but I'm really excited to begin looking at her.

Since I posted this I've realized how vastly under read I am so I'm going to push back my schedule a few weeks to try and gather more literature. Once I get to the point where I'm ready to start looking at Butler I'll definitely shoot you a PM to talk about Butler.

Thanks!!! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is awesome. So very awesome. This is exactly what I'm wanting. Thank you for sharing your story, I really really appreciate it. Once I get all of the resources that I'm wanting together and start writing, how would you like me to cite your story, if at all? Reddit name, an alias, nickname, first name, etc..  ? The paper is very informal so I'd be okay with any citation or lack of citation that you feel comfortable with. This paper is just for me to begin exploring non-binary systems in a way that I feel most comfortable and won't be published anywhere besides a blog I'll make to archive it in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason I'm writing this is because nearly all of the literature that is produced revolving around non-binary gender/sexuality systems tend to be very reductionist (I.E the Judith Butler model, or the Foucaudian model) and I feel like that isn't representative of the Queer+ community. So I want to start writing a paper that highlights specific stories rather than an overlapping narrative of "This is how people aren't normative". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I guess it was really dumb of me to ask this without giving my story as an example of what I'm asking for:

I am mostly comfortable identifying with the gender assigned to me at birth (male), but preformatively I'm not a traditionally masculine way. Most of the time I'm pretty okay being called a male, but sometimes when I get grouped in with the "Guy group" it feels icky and uncomfortable and I'd much prefer be with the female group. 

I have nearly always identified as homosexual but was quite phobic towards feminine guys (especially gay men. I wanted to punch the living crap out of "overtly flaming gays" as I very homophobically referred to them). The most significant moment when I realized I'm much more comfortable preforming in a feminine way was when I read Alan Downs "Velvet Rage" and he talked about the internalization of hatred. It clicked.. "Oh.. these feminine guys made me really uncomfortable because I hated that about myself." Since then it's been a self discovery and self actualization process mostly through academic literature. 

So, what I'm asking for is: How did you realize that the traditional gender binary system wasn't for you, and a brief description of how you self-actualized and processed that into your identity. I did it in a very academic/literature based way.
