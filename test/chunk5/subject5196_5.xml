I started today and I actually had a really good time.  Let's do this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely respect Aldo as a fighter, and everything, but as someone who got into the sport right before 189 (not due to Conor, just a coincidence), and has only been exposed to him in the last year, I gotta say, he's REALLY turning me off with this shit talking lately.  

I get he wants the fight, but this comes across so strangely, at least to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, seriously, long term, what do you want the UFC to be? An entity that makes a ton of money based on entertaining matchups, or an organization that pits the best of weight classes against each other as they attempt to be king of the hill/belt holder?  

If Conor wants to abdicate his belt, and continue to fight money fights, then I don't care what he does.  But if you think it really is in the best, long-term interest of a sport that is still trying to get over the hump of being truly mainstream to hold up talent for the bottom dollar, I can't agree with you.  

There's a fine line, and the UFC needs to be careful with the way they're toeing it, that's all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mentioned in a comment section a few days back that I was thinking of attempting a size 6 pair of jeans.  

I tried them on today.  

They didn't fit. 




Had to try on the 4s instead _. 

They were definitely vanity sized, though, but I'll accept this super awesome small victory.  I'm down from almost a size 16 at my heaviest to now comfortably a 6.  I can handle that.  More importantly, I fit into juniors pants easily again, which means I can buy clothes that actually fit me (short a f over here).  This weight loss journey is almost at its end and I can hardly believe it.  

And you know how I did it? 

Counted calories.  

I went to the gym as well, definitely, but I saw the most obvious losses when I stuck to my calorie deficit.   

I want to thank you all here for getting me over the hump.  I was at a plateau for nearly 7 months.  Then I gained weight back over the holidays.  Since I started reading this sub about two months ago, I'm back down ten pounds, and one pound away from a healthy weight on the new BMI calculator (I'm already below 25 on the old one).  So, again, a HUGE thank you to everyone for the motivation!  

EDIT: Oh, I should mention, getting a Fitbit was also a HUGE help.  MFP is great, but the Fitbit was more brutally honest with me about how many calories I needed to be consuming, based on my activity for the day.  Once I got the Fitbit, things got a lot harder, but the weight loss got a lot easier. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone, 

So, I've had my Charge HR for about two months now.  About two weeks ago I started to notice some serious lag in connectivity between it and my phone.  

A few days ago, a firmware update was released.  My Charge HR updated about halfway and then suddenly stopped connecting with my phone at all.  I made several attempts to restart the update to no avail.  

I uninstalled the app, reinstalled it, restarted my phone, restarted the fitbit, etc.  Finally I deleted the device from the app and factory reset the fitbit.  The app says, "We've Found your Charge HR" but then it says to either Try Again, or restart my bluetooth, none of which fixes anything. 

So what's the deal?  It can see the Charge HR, but it won't sync? 

Also, two days ago, when things started going haywire, the fitbit started logging HUGE numbers of calories burned and steps taken, then the clock got off by about 5 minutes. 

I don't know what else to do, I can't find my wireless sync dongle, but I'm pretty frustrated and will try just about anything.  I'm hoping there's another option besides buying a new dongle.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, thank you.  I really put a lot of effort into it and it's good to know that it's been appreciated ;).  

But no, seriously, it just kinda crept up on me for about 20 or 30 pages or so, this feeling where it was like, 'something's wrong here.' And then I finally realized, the problem was I'd started seriously disliking the book.  Rolling my eyes at dialogue, sighing over plot points, being generally disappointed by stereotypical behaviors or actions.  Parts of the book going almost nowhere, etc.  

Plus, it was pitched as a comedy, and honestly, it got a lot darker than I was mentally prepared for rather quickly.  So, I don't know, maybe in a different frame of mind I'd have liked it more, but when you see things like this before ever even reading the plot:

Hugh Laurie concocts an uproarious cocktail of comic zingers and over-the-top action in this "ripping spoof of the spy genre"

you don't exactly go into it expecting a lot of melodrama and introspection, I guess.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. And honestly, I don't see him ever losing at featherweight at this point. For the sake of his health, I only want to see him fight at FW one more time, preferably against Frankie. After that, let Aldo come to lightweight if he wants a rematch.  Plus, remember what the move did for AJ. 

I think Conor at LW us going to be a ton of fun. He needs to shore up the ground game, sure, but I think you're going to see more interesting *fights* from him there. Wars, instead of one round massacres. 

All last night did was re-endear me to Conor, who I'd gone very cold to, and got me SUPER hyped to see what he does next. 

I hope this isn't a Rousey. I hope his post fight presence has proved to people that's obviously not who he is. I hope to see him at UFC 200 in a title fight at FW and then the next chapter begin.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My review of this from Goodreads is brief. I wish I could take all of the things I've had to say about this book in person and really get it down in to good writing, but I just can't.  

 A beautiful melancholy to this I want expecting. I really feel like the film doesn't do the story justice. Enjoyed it far more than I expected to. 

That brief synopisis of my opinion will have to do, I guess.  

Mainly there was just such a feeling of false bravado throughout the book, that I think the filmmakers truly missed.  I never thought I'd read this book. I couldn't be happier that I did. </TEXT>

Ive never been able to find a good time line of books to read for him to get into his story. If you or anyone else can recommend one, please do. 

Oddly, I was surprised to see the one Batman series not on the list of recommendations, the one the movies are based on, I believe? Because I've owned those for a while, but have never read them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I saw someone recommend it in the comedy round. I'm super excited to see what she's come up with. 

And glad to see her doing things. Her depression story has always left me really anxious when I think about her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only one off of what I wanted the top 4 to be, and the fourth book (Persepolis) is in the top ten. Nice! I'm really excited by this. I've owned Hyperbole and a Half for well over a year, but haven't read it (old fan of the blog, though, so I've read a lot of the stories before). And.... I've never read Watchmen... :o!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a non-smoker I found myself amused by how often I'd be like, "Yeah Nick! Great maneuver." Honestly, I felt pity for most of the people involved in the story, more than anything else.  It's true that the country was practically founded on tobacco and an end to the industry is detrimental to a large part of the agricultural country. 

But it's also true that smoking is bad for you, and no amount of spin tactics can change that. So I had fun reading it, from a sense of relief that in this day and age, we're moving further and further away from the practice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ironically, I think this was the first book of the batch that I only read a physical copy of.  I never read eBooks, but for this little challenge, I've had to rely on my libraries digital media, so that's meant lots and lots of phone screen squinting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You liked the ending?  I thought it completely undermined the rest of the book, to be honest.  

Being born around the same time as you (87), I did LOVE reading something written from the time of my early memories.  I'd honestly forgotten about Old Joe, and really cigarette ads in general.  It's crazy to see how much has changed since then, and it felt like being in a fun little time machine reading it.  Maybe I should find more stuff from the early 90s to check out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went home sick from work yesterday and spent the evening finishing this. 

I was definitely surprised I enjoyed it. I'd always assumed the book would look down its nose too much, instead of what it was, 
which was a teardown of both sides of the battle. 

While I liked the book a great deal for the majority, the final chapter really almost ruined everything. 

Still, solid 7.5/10 gave it a 4 on goodreads, giving it a 7 here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disagree with you, but that's OK.  I've seen interviews with Cormier where he seems to suggest that he's just hyping the fight, where I feel like I've more than once seen Jones say he just straight up hates the guy, outside of them being in a fight camp against one another.

Though, with that said, it WAS Cormier who put hands on Jones at Media Day, so who knows. 

It's still my absolute favorite rivalry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was my first live Silva fight.  I loved it.  I haven't seen the fight against Diaz.  With all the bitching about it, I assumed it was a boring fight.  Was it actually more similar to this fight? I get that Anderson wasn't as serious as he could have been, but I'm kinda taking him seriously in the fact that he's just not interested in pursuing the belt again, and just wants to be out there having a good fight.  Didn't he say something like he only wants superfights now?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I voted for Tangles as well.  Alzheimer's is a topic that brings me to tears almost immediately.  I really don't handle the topic well, but I care about it so much.  I'd love to see how it's presented in such a way. 

I admit that I am not a fan of non-fiction when I read. I couldn't tell you why. I was a history major in college and I love documentaries.  I don't know what it is about the act of reading for pleasure that turns me off of non-fiction, but I like this book club for challenging me to read things I wouldn't.  Even the comedy books deal with topics I'd never read about normally, so this is a great experience for me, and I hope others will follow suit in their voting to try and expand horizons a bit.  

I'll check out the other selections you mentioned, and I will look into Joe Sacco as well, even if it's not for this particular book challenge.  I'm very curious to see how that's presented.  I don't know why I don't read more graphic novels, they can be so interesting. Such a new way to look at topics. </TEXT>
