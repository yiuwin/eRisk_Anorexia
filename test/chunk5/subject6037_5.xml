To me it looks rather like the tool used to get people to exercise their lungs after respiratory/cardiac surgery, or a form of peak flow meter.

The full term is "incentive spirometer".

Quoted from article I linked above in my post, "Following surgery, patients are asked to use an incentive spirometer and encouraged to take deep breaths and cough (if necessary). This helps remove any extra mucous or fluid in the lungs. So you know, if the airsacs stay closed and mucous builds up, pneumonia can develop" </TEXT>

Sandra did an interview in Sept. stating she won't return...

Do you have a link to this interview? Pretty sure Sandra will return if Shonda asks her to but I don't think it will be until the final season. Unless they need it for the ratings.

Interview quote from Hollywood Reporter article:

"Did you already speak with Shonda about potentially coming back for the eventual series finale?

We talked about that when I told her I was going to leave but we haven't talked about it again. There are certain things that Shonda and I talk about once and then we leave it because we want things to happen without pressure. I told her, "If you guys want to finish it out however you want to finish it out, I'd be more than happy to come back. And if it doesn't fit in that way, I totally understand. I just want you to know that I'm available." Who knows! I might be doing something fabulous and it might not work out but I did say, "Yes, of course I would.""

	<TEXT> Sandra Oh picked the last name of Yang for Cristina:

""I grew up with the Yangs in Ottawa, in Canada," the 42-year-old elaborated. "And it was Mr. and Mrs. Yang and their four daughters" 

Source: http://www.wetpaint.com/sandra-oh-last-name-yang-827985/

Also picking the last name of a character to represent an aspect of their personality or a symbol of their arc as a character is common. For example, Dorothy Gale in "The Wizard of Oz" starts her journey because of a tornado. Luke Skywalker in "Star Wars" leaves his home planet to travel through space on his journey. </TEXT>

I just assume that first year resident = 2nd year? Because 1st year = intern, then he took his intern test, passed and become 1st year resident? 

The first year of a residency is called an internship. You generally rotate through a variety of specialities including the one you were hired for. In the second year you are a year 2 resident or R2.

	<TEXT> Unfortunately in this tight housing market many potential renters may be left behind if they don't provide the information as requested by landlords. It's just an all too easy way for the landlord to eliminate a rental application, especially when they have so many to chose from.

Some of what has apparently been requested on these forms does seem a bit invasive and I'm not sure how it would indicate whether someone would make a good tenant or not.

	<TEXT> I think Shonda really, really likes Isaiah Washington and didn't want to kick him off the show. She and the network gave him a chance after the initial incident when what he said while filming was revealed but when he did it again I don't think she had any choice.

As for Katherine Heigl I don't really know how Shonda feels (I'm guessing there's no love lost there) but Katherine left of her own volition. I would think Shonda feels she has no obligation or desire to bring her back but never say never. After all Sherry Stringfield came back to ER years after quitting abruptly. The producers were so upset she had to agree she wouldn't act in any other production for the remaining time on her contract.  </TEXT>

Having someone throw a rock through your windshield isn't really a SVA then, is it?

It's a single vehicle if the person throwing the rock is not in a car.

Have you ever run over a smashed bottle?  They rarely do anything.

I wrote "a bunch of smashed bottles" not singular.

http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-11/news/vw-66_1_broken-glass

Another poin, tire blow outs never have to lead to an accident.  I don't know how to stress that any more.

Single vehicle accidents are always the fault of the driver.  This *young woman* has no one to blame but herself.

Um no. 

What about the cases when some idiot throws a rock off a bridge on a busy highway below shattering the windshield of a car and causing a single car accident? Or a tire blow out because someone drove over a bunch of smashed bottles thrown out the window by someone else in another car? I could go on. Accidents have many causes. To make a blanket statement about single vehicles crashes is shortsighted and limiting to say the least.

Is this an external hard drive for an iPad?? 

Yes. There are 3 that I know of: Seagate, Western Digital and SanDisk:

http://www.seagate.com/ca/en/consumer/stream/wireless-plus/
https://www.wdc.com/products/portable-storage/my-passport-wireless.html
http://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/HFSQ2ZM/B/sandisk-connect-64gb-wireless-media-drive

I have tried all of these. There are newer versions made by Western Digital and SanDisk than what I've linked above.

The first one I owned was the Seagate. It has a clunky, large hardware design but the software (an app you download) worked ok. The second one was the Western Digital. It was also large and has a removable media disk for use in a camera.  The SanDisk I linked to is very small, lightweight, has an app and also has an external SD slot. So if you take a lot of pictures with a device that uses an SD card these latter two are a good option.

In my opinion the SanDisk is best overall but by the time I got that one you could no longer play videos from the iTunes library using Safari on the iPad (as stated above this feature has been disabled). Apple deliberately made some changes so this would no longer work. I read online SanDisk was trying to create a workaround but I'm not sure if they succeeded as I stopped using it for that purpose. You can stream videos in other formats from the device to your iPad for viewing on all three devices as far as I know.

	<TEXT> NDAs are about intellectual property not hardware. 

If the company gave him old iPads containing confidential information it's at least partially their responsibility if they didn't wipe them. 

If they didn't then Lip could be in trouble for passing those iPads along to Fiona's diner if they contained proprietary information. However, someone would have to find and use it in a way that the company would be become informed and subsequently take action. 

But I'm sure Lip was smart enough to wipe them if they weren't already before turning them into point of sale devices for the wait staff to use. </TEXT>

Is that the GTA from above rotated? Trying to figure out where this viewpoint is

Yes. The orientation is west/east rather than north/south we're used to seeing images/maps of the Great Lakes region. So the top of the image is west. 

The GTA is the greyish area to the right of Lake Ontario (the main body of water in the image). It shows how built up this area is in comparison to the surrounding regions.

The dark blob at the top (furthest west) is near the Hamilton Harbour. If you zoom in you can see the Skyway Bridge. I believe the black line (which includes the black blob) that runs from the left to right across the land mass is the Niagara Escarpment.

Also if you zoom to in the area left of the GTA on Lake Ontario you can see the Toronto Islands. </TEXT>

Why is she such a slut? 

Why are the other characters "sluts"? 

Has't Lip had his fair share of partners? Wasn't Ian a rent boy? Didn't Frank prostitute himself with another man in the bathroom of The Alibi? Also wasn't Carl performing oral sex on girls for an entire summer? I think Debbie has been pretty opportunistic about who she's slept with (almost with a woman so she could keep her housing). Heck even Kevin and V are no longer monogamous.

Start a tenants group.

A fair number of people who live in this building are the source of the problem. They have their heat cranked up as soon as it's available mid-September and keep it on until mid-June when we switch to air conditioning.

As someone else noted above the heat from other units is on to such a degree that they don't even turn the heat on in their unit. Same goes for me. I have not even turned the thermostat to the heat option in over 10 years. 

TL;DR Other people in my building do not care about the heat because their unit is the source of the heat. </TEXT>

this, exactly. we get AC on in june, which by then we're buckling in the heat and then off in sept, while october's still roasting. 

Same here.

We rarely have to turn the heat on, save for one week in jan-feb. airflow only does so much. It doesn't help that on overcast days, people flip the heat on and go to work and the building just gets hotter and hotter. ( heat's included in rent)

Open a window.  

This doesn't work unless there's another window/door open to create a draft and cause the air to circulate. I only have windows on one wall and it's illegal to prop your door open (fire regulations).

Talk with your landlord.  

I have. They don't care. I was told there's nothing they can do about it.

Mine turned on the heat, but keeps it low enough during the day so it doesn't overheat the place.

The units have individually controlled heat in my building.

The second question on body cams he started by saying that choices around turning them on/off were determined in collaboration with other organizations (e.g., Privacy Commission). But then he said it was at the discretion of each officer when to do so. Will the officers be trained on when they should use the body cam?

I don't think he answered the third question about officers breaking the law. He did say they press criminal charges when warranted as they always have in the past. I don't think this was the point though... </TEXT>

Are Joe, Cameron   Gordon essentially building the first business model for an ISP?

The depends on whether you think the "door" is a browser or an ISP. My bet is on the former. Some of the walled gardens mentioned in the presentation (AOL, CompuServe, Genie, etc.) are already a form of an ISP. They represent a step between a BBS and an ISP. They already developed Mutiny, a closed garden so they know how that works. And they know that's not how it's going to work in the future. 

Joe, Gordon and Tom all had a run at using the whiteboard to describe the model they think they're seeing. But It's really only Joe that seeing the big picture. It's not about using dial-up to access a BBS ('one to many'). It's about the Internet, which is 'many to many'.

This may be true, idk of all the research,  but in my experience with true alcoholics this doesn't go well. I think if they are in intense therapy too it may, but idk. I think the cards are stacked against him.

That's basically what I wrote. There are people who can control it and people who can't. Agreed Lip is likely to fall into the latter category given his genetic background. 

It was interesting to see (to me as a scientist) an example of controlled drinking depicted in television even it wasn't explicitly stated as such. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a whole field of research (and controversy) about controlled drinking vs. abstinence (the AA philosophy). AA believes "once a drunk, always a drunk". Advocates of controlled drinking believe an individual can moderate their intake by setting limits much in the way Lip did when he first returned to the Alibi. I think it depends on a person's physiology.

I don't know why but I always get the feeling Jessica Capshaw and Sara Ramirez weren't close at all in real life. 

I get the sense they are very different people. I think Jessica is into her family and home life when she's not working. Sara's a bit more of an extrovert IMHO and is involved in a lot of activism.  </TEXT>

A good thing? Maybe Lip starts working the AA steps and reaches out to her to make amends?

Can you legally ask for a donation back? I thought "gifts" were something you could never get back in court...but I may have watched too much judge Judy.

It would depend on any stipulations for the dispersion of funds made by the granting organization. As a scientist when you apply for funding as the principle investigator (PI) from a funding source such as the federal government a detailed, line by line budget is required amongst other documentation. As work on the grant progresses you may need to file update reports including evidence of how the money is being spent depending on the length of the grant. I'm not sure what happens if the grant holder is the institution rather than the PI on the grant. 

For private donations in which there was no real competition for the funding it's up to the grantee as to what stipulations are put into place. So they may have learned a valuable lesson regarding donations if this is the case.

As for CAMH if they did in fact do what was alleged they should know better as they've had a lot of experience holding funds from government regulated funding agencies, which require accountability and transparency. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As explained in the linked article there are many takes done to complete a scene. This may cause an actor to be repeatedly eating the food. Sometimes they have a spit bucket where the actor can get rid of the food in their mouth between takes. But I'm guessing that unless it's integral to the plot most actors are just pushing the food around on their plate until the scene is over. In some cases they may exchange a full plate for an empty one as the scene progresses to make it look more realistic. </TEXT>

I didn't say "wear a garbage bag", I said "don't wear uncomfortable shoes."

Show me a pair of comfortable high heels that would be "fashionably acceptable" at an awards ceremony such as the Emmys where all the women are basically under a microscope that examines what they're wearing?

The reporter/interviewer can wear what she wants, at least shoe-wise because that  likely won't appear on camera and she's not a celebrity that's going to be critiqued by the fashion police. </TEXT>
