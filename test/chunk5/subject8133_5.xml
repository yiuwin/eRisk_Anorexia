	<TEXT> Just watercolour. I started in watercolour many years ago, then found acrylic then oil, then pencil. I kinda dropped off using watercolour because I enjoyed the other mediums more.
Now I've found a renewed interest in it, it is just such a different experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm no expert on watercolour but for finer details use a finer brush with very little water, don't paint wet on wet and work from light to dark. I worked very delicately on the girl because like you said, it can go bad very quickly. Its also becoming my favourite medium. Happy painting!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right, it definitely didn't turn out the way I intended. It got to a point though, where I realised exactly what you were saying, that the  head was much darker almost sinister but being watercolor you have to work quickly and don't have the luxury of sitting back and observing and making changes. I should have started lighter on the head rather than strong darker blues and purples. All a good learning experience :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, this definitely didn't turn out how I imagined in my head I wanted it to be much lighter and floaty (if that makes sense) All a learning experience :) </TEXT>
