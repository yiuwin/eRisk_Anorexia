	<TEXT> I was reading an article about warner not releasing another patch for Akrham Origins and it said: Montreal has indicated it will not release another patch for the game - a decision that has upset many players who have complained about game-breaking bugs since last year. And someone said "I can't even finish the freaking game and you think it has no problems worth patching?" 
Is this true? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have played Batman arkham City and I thought it was an amazing game. I want to play Arkham Origins but I am getting mixed reviews, some are saying its better than arkham city and others are saying it was worse. I heard Origins was longer than Arkham city, the city was bigger, the story was better and the combat is the same. I would just like to know if it is worth buying and playing or should I just purchase another game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes that was the one I was refering to, I like The Curse 2, and both the grudges as well. I don't know how they make everything so creepy and come up with the visuals they do. i still think The Original grudge films are pretty scary aswell. The part where the news anchors face distorts was pretty disturbing and when a guys in a copy room and the machine starts copying out the same picture and then it shows a giant translucent face on the wall or ceiling behind him, cant really remember but it was something like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dawn of the dead, night of the living dead, resident evil, 28 days later, Rec, Pontypool and the walking dead are the only zombie movies I will ever watch. I find zombie movies these days are overrated, boring, not scary and pretty much the same everytime I see one besides the special effects makeup. I just think the whole zombie things stupid and they should stop making zombie movies, but thats just me.
