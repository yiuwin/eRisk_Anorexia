Hello guys, I'm posting this here because I am trying to grow my audience a bit, and just share my music to see what people think. If you could have a listen, that would be really cool, repost, if you liked it. Thanks so much!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really sure, I went to sleep at around 10pm and was woken at about 4am so I don't think I was in REM, I just felt quite drowsy, I didn't think FILD was going to work, but to my surprise, I went into the dream quite quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, so a few days ago I just found out about FILD, and the following night I was woken up by my dog, so I thought it was the ideal time to try out FILD. I have wanted to try it again, but using my alarm. The problem with this is that I move too much and I can't FILD, I have been looking for an app that either has a huge dismiss button or that turns off automatically after 20 seconds or something, basically something that allows for minimal movement. I would be interested to know how other people wake themselves up without moving too much. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I once lucid dreamt without even doing an rc or anything, I just suddenly bursted out saying "IM HAVING A LUCID DREAM!!!" I basically told everyone that I was dreaming, and most people replied with "yes... yes you are" as they were smiling, it was like I was the idiot who didn't realise what was happening. That was pretty cool. </TEXT>

Please take a moment to listen to this, it's my first time using Ableton, as Iv'e just switched from Garageband(don't laugh), it's unfinished, as you will see, but if you have an idea for a drop, just message me on Soundcloud, that would be appreciated!  </TEXT>
