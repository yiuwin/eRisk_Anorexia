I will say though, and this probably sounds crazy, but I've always thought still-big WRs like Julio and Dez are better natural physical profiles for the WR position. Calvin's sheer size and leg/stride length made it tough on him at times -- running routes, evading players in the open field, avoiding hard hits.

Of course, relative to that size and crazy length he was more of a freak athlete than Julio or Dez, so he made up for any hardships, but to me it was almost like Calvin was too much of a freak. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, race is a factor intertwined everywhere; there are racially-prejudiced (racist) actions, thoughts, utterances happening all the time. I've been guilty of those things, you have, most people have. It's a giant issue today as it ever was (albeit less so).

The real problem is not the acknowledgment of those things by calling out peoples' actions or collective actions as racist, or others in general as racist as a result of their actions (you are what you do, right?). Exaggerated judgements are only natural in an Obama-years environment of an exponentially-increased bar of awareness (i.e. there's a lot of racist shit going on, and more people are aware of that). On the spectrum you're going to get stuff that's ignored and some that's exaggerated.

The real issue IMO is people shutting down at the word. They don't like the idea that they can, if only relatively unconsciously, succumb to a dynamic they know is so rightfully fraught and damaging. 99% of people know racism is bad. They just don't like the idea that they're guilty of racially prejudicial things. It doesn't have to be malicious to be hurtful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk about *good* rookie season, but Stanley is definitely progressing, and has looked quite good over the past three weeks or so. The sustained flashes are certainly there, the progression is there (he has clearly improved over last season as well as the beginning of this season). Calling him a bust at this point -- a 20-year-old with 114 NBA games under his belt -- is simply asinine.

And that's just offensively btw; he can already defend 2-4 effectively at the NBA level. That alone has a lot of value. If his offense -- and his shot especially (he does have over a 60% true shooting in January, fwiw -- he could be a really useful player. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It definitely got better as it went, and thus started relatively slowly -- at least compared to what it became by the end of the season -- but calling the first half of the season 'routine sitcom stuff' doesn't ring true to me. I don't think it ever had enough of those elements to make pointing it out mean much. From the get-go it was different, unique; it's what kept me as engaged as I was.

	<TEXT> Here's Dan Fienberg [on the subject](http://uproxx.com/hitfix/tv-s-best-of-the-decade-no-31-veronica-mars/):

 But in that first season, again using his literary background as a foundation, Thomas unspooled a complicated and involving 22-episode mystery around Lilly Kanes murder, while also working in regular Encyclopedia Blonde-style weekly puzzles. The conclusion of the Lilly Kane arc may not have been flawless, but it was as good as it gets when it comes to that sort of thing.

Then, in the next season, Thomas decided (was told) to tone down the serialization, to make the series more accessible to new viewers. The dumbing down of the show did nothing to improve ratings and many things to mute what was so unique about the show. The mysteries became duller, the relationships became more strainer and forced. The second season had the genius of Steve Guttenberg, which salvaged it at least somewhat, but the third season had almost nothing to recommend it, unless you happened to be a big fan of Chris Lowells Piz. </TEXT>

Many of the teams don't even turn much of a profit. Lately valuations have been increasing due to TV deals, but that hasn't always been the case. They are toys; they are tools to gain fame and notoriety (see: Mark Cuban), etc... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Lowe's [Pelicans column](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18496598/zach-lowe-anthony-davis-jrue-holiday-new-orleans-pelicans-nba) yesterday, writing on the issue of Jrue Holiday's impending free agency:

 They could also get ahead of the problem and sniff out trades for veteran point guards under contract beyond this season. Two obvious names: Reggie Jackson and Goran Dragic. Let's just say there is a disagreement between the Pistons and every team they've talked to about the level of Jackson's availability. </TEXT>

He missed 2016 OTAs and started camp on PUP, possibly after an offseason surgery. Soon after returning he got injured again and had to miss multiple preseason games (ankle). Mid-season this year after seeing the field he got hurt again (ankle) and had to miss time. Then he played again late in the year and once again got injured (foot) and had to go on IR. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mayhew was pretty good at free agency, believe it or not; Quinn just had a bad first try with that avenue. Quinn's first draft looks solid-average-ish right now, which admittedly would be better than the average Mayhew one, but one year in is too early to judge a draft class with any significant level of certainty. Mr. Quinn just produced a roster that finished with the Lions' worst defensive DVOA since 2008 and second-worst offensive DVOA since 2009. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those combine stats matter a *lot* for defensive lineman.

If you want some rankings, BR's NFL1000 ranked Robinson [84th](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2685170-nfl1000-final-regular-season-breakdown-of-the-leagues-top-players/page/15) out of 99 DTs this season.

There are very few stats that are useful for lineman, but pressure rate (ranked 110/123 interior DL, per PFF) and run stop percentage are 2 good ones. Tackles are bad ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His athleticism really worries me projection-wise. He's a genuinely [terrible athlete](https://3sigmaathlete.com/rankings/dl/). Especially in an attack-oriented DL scheme. And for a guy who's calling card was the run game, he looked really bad in that area this season, even considering he was a rookie. I don't think it's a stretch to say he was worse vs. the run than the pass, and he was baddd vs. the pass. I'll believe it when I see it with him; I'm not optimistic.

P.S. Don't give me those bad stats. Show me run stop percentage. </TEXT>
