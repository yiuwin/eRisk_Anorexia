	<TEXT> I thoroughly agree with you. But what would that look like? That I believe is something that we are having an issue with. 

We have had this system for so long that no one can imagine a different future.

I recently checked out Flux. A new party where you basically vote yourself on the issues that matter to you. More direct democracy than anything I have seen before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looking to join a team for some casual battles.

I have a fair few 6s and a couple of 7s.

Not really a serious player but do enjoy the competitive environment and coordinated playing.

Hit me up on the NA server.

	<TITLE> Good Martial Arts dojos for a returning martial artist and student? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all, looking for a good sensei or a good bunch of people to train with.

I used to do martial arts back in the day, but am all unfit and flabby now.

So I am looking for somewhere around the ryde area or on the Rhodes train line as I won't mind traveling if it's a nice dojo.

If you go somewhere or know someone who currently practices let me know.

Thanks all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I have noticed this in several games, on different computers with different IP addresses.

It must be a bug they didn't  find when testing. Everyone gets it in the match. It makes the game unplayable. </TEXT>
