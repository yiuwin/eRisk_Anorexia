	<TEXT>  Horrible editing, click bait headlines with unsourced material, outright lies and irrelevant opinions make MSM entertainment not news.

I agree with all of that, although I would point out that the most nuanced, carefully researched journalism comes from MSM journalists and institutions: Christopher Hitchens-Vanity Fair, Chris Hedges-The New York Times, Glenn Greenwald-The Guardian *and* TMZ, Buzzfeed and all the rest of that "infotainment" stuff as well as Fox News, RT and Al-Jazeera (all three being propoganda outlets, Fox News for private corporations, RT for Putin's regime, Al-Jazeera for the Qatari royal families regime) all come under the umbrella of MSM don't they? 

I would like to see someone or something create an organization where the true journalists can do the job that needs to be done

So would I, and I think David Simon should be in charge of it! (seriously he really should be), the problem i'm interested in is: What could such an organization do to avoid being discredited, undermined, smeared or simply dismissed out of hand by conspiracy theorists? </TEXT>
