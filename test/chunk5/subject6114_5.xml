	<TEXT> Provide evidence that it was specifically the "Ariel thing" that changed people's minds. That's all I ask. I am more than willing to hear the people out who say this, but I also need some kind of evidence for a casual relationship rather than just assuming it because that was the chronology of events. There's far more plausible explanations for why the response changed the way it did, when it did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> STOP THIS NARRATIVE. You have absolutely no proof that's what happened. You are using pieces of the story, filling in motivation, and re-writing it into your own narrative. How do you know what motivated people? Do you know for a fact that this didn't happen: a large group of people didn't think they were good, but enough people were posting nice things, including ROBIN HIMSELF, to make those people uncomfortable about posting a negative opinion. All you need is an excited and motivated group to make it seem like that's what the sub thinks. What's more, any negative opinions would have been downvoted and hidden. It's not like those breakdowns were getting 13.5k responses. Once he went negative, the climate changed and allowed the group of people who thought they sucked to say so. When other people say dumb stuff, we don't automatically say they suck at their craft. You act like this sub is a monolithic mindset. Human-beings aren't brilliant, but they are a lot more complex and varied than what you guys are giving them credit for. Not everyone is motivated by the same thing. Unless you can provide evidence of a lot of people saying they liked the breakdowns and then after his comments saying the opposite, stop telling us what motivated us. 

Edit: What's more, people upvote people who are criticizing this forum for their negative opinion of Robin Black. If that doesn't destroy the narrative that everyone turned on him based on a tweet, I don't know what does. It's pretty much confirming the rainbow of opinions and motivations I've been talking about...but it's ok, keep saying chronology implies causation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter what you say, the narrative of Robin Black supporters on this sub is going to be, "Y'all loved his breakdowns, and after the comment y'all decided they were no good." They expected people like you or I to actively shit on the guy while he was posting on this forum and say his breakdowns suck ( though you would have never seen it because it would have been down-voted into the ground...shitting on a guy who posts on this forum and who was yet to be a douche to anyone else is usually not a good look).  </TEXT>

"It would have to be an interesting fighter, but not a top fighter", Belfort said. "I've been fighting good guys before: Dan Henderson, [Chris] Weidman, Dan Henderson, 'Jacar' [Souza], [Gegard] Mousasi and now Kelvin [Gastelum]. These are all hard fights, so if you can book a smoother fight... What's the name of that guy from WWE? CM Punk would be a good fight", Belfort laughed. "CM Punk, let's get it on.

	<TEXT>  I don't really have an opinion, I haven't seen his analysis enough. I do find it weird how opinion of his analysis changed with a tweet, classless or not, as they're unrelated things. But that's people I guess.

I don't have an opinion, but here's my opinion in the very next sentence. Honestly, just about everything you said was your opinion, even in the way you recounted the narrative. The issue isn't monolithic, as you seem to believe. A vocal section of this sub was certainly excited about Robin Black, but you are not telling the full story. Let's start with this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/3quphn/check_out_robin_blacks_first_official_ufc_piece/

Aside from the general excitement and leading tone of the title, Robin Black himself is the number one up vote. Now, I was here at the time. I didn't think too much of the video when I saw it. Should I have voiced that here, on this sub, at that time? How is that going to be received? It's simple, people feel more comfortable voicing their opinion when it's going to be well received and not rude--at least that's how I feel. I'm not going to shit on the guy when he's getting an opportunity and actually posting on this sub. I'm going to give him more of a chance than I would someone else. If you're going to tell the story, tell the story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dwight is not better than Bill Walton when he was healthy...it's not even close. Here is a list of people I think are better than Dwight:

Hakeem

Shaq

Wilt

Rusell

Ewing

Admiral

Robert Parish

Moses Malone

Dave Cowens

Willis Reed

Tim Duncan (played center for a decade)

Alonzo Mourning

Artis Gilmore

Bob McAdoo

Pau Gasol (played center a lot of his career)

Thats 15, and I can come up with more. I mean top 10? No way do I have him in the top 10. To be fair, he is kind of hurt by the era in which he plays/played.  I probably have him at 15-18 range. 

To be honest, it wasn't too long ago that people on here agreed with me, and I don't think Dwight has done much to change that in the last 2 years and some change. The evolution of the circle jerk is kind of interesting.

2 years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/286la6/where_doeswill_dwight_howard_rank_all_time_among/

Opinions that received at least 10 upvotes: 

Eh I think he's on the same tier as Zo. Shit, Zo was probably better at his peak, pre-kidney problems.



This is how I have it shaking out.
Definitely better: Kareem, Wilt, Shaq, Robinson, Hakeem, Russell, Moses, Ewing, Walton
Comparable/slightly better: Willis Reed, Zo, Bob McAdoo
Then you have the historical guys like Unseld, Mikan, Cowens, Artis Gilmore. Dwight is almost certainly the better player strictly from an ability perspective, but in terms of historical greatness I would put all those guys over Dwight. That would put Dwight at #17, which I think is a pretty fair spot for him.

1 year ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3152w6/is_dwight_howard_a_top_10_center_of_all_time/

Then around this time he starts edging out Ewing: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/44uovu/where_does_prime_dwight_howard_rank_among_the/

It's weird how these things work. Some how over the last year Dwight Howard has gone from "hell no" he's not a top ten center to what we got here.

	<TEXT> Ok, what ever he did has nothing to do with how I feel about his breakdowns. I've watched two of his videos in my life. In the second one I watched he talked about how he was dumbing his style down to reach mass audiences. It was clear to me that it wasn't for me, yet I stayed silent. I didn't understand what everyone was raving about, yet they were very vocal. Perhaps it had everything to do with the fact that he was posting on here. Once he made that comment and people started turning on him, the collective perception of the sub changed. To me, it's not so much that what he said changed how people felt, it was that people like me could say that they didn't care for his crummy run downs without getting downvoted and silenced after that happened. The people who were ecstatic about his breakdowns had less to defend him with after that. What's more, the breakdowns didn't have much quality themselves to use as a defense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The difference between the financial benefits of me performing really well at my job (zero) and an NBA caliber player working on their skills is huge. A lot of us have a job with virtually no upward economic mobility. The same is not even remotely true in the NBA, especially when it comes to the potential prospects for a 18 or 19 year old kid with skills. What's more, most of our jobs have little to nothing to do with our natural talents and cultivating those talents. Generally speaking, people get on anyone's case when they waste talent, and that's what we are talking about: wasting talent. Wasting talent is not what's occurring when someone doesn't put much effort into their walmart job. Not really sure where everyone is finding the irony or hypocrisy in these situations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't a criticism, because I've enjoyed your writing in the past, but writing a book to reach casuals seems a bit weird to me. Casuals don't invest much of their time watching the sport on TV and are significantly less likely to be reading a 280-page book on it. People spend more of their time reading than ever before; the difference is in the quality of what they are reading (facebook, reddit, the tv screen, steet signs, and so on). Half the adults in the world do not read more than 5 books a year, so your target audience has to be people passionate about what ever subject you are writing about. I also think that your writing style and expertise is better suited for people who's fandom exceeds the casual limits. With that being said, it is quite laudable to want to reach those people, and I hope you are able to accomplish that goal. Good luck with the book!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's kind of cute that we now just say, "Vitor was on TRT, but so was a lot of people." It's revisionist history. Everyone who was on this sub back then knew Vitor was abusing the shit out of TRT between tests and cycling down to normal levels closer to the fight. The guy was cheating under the old rules. It's weird, we all seemed to have forgotten that. 

Also, I'd take Vitor's special sauce over speed any day in athletic competition. </TEXT>

It's clear that Vitor was abusing the system that was in place. What he was doing was illegal at the time, they just were not test regularly enough. It's pretty clear to anyone with a pair of eyes that he would abusing trt outside of testing and then cycled down to normal levels close to the fight. He was cheating under the old system, he just wasn't being caught. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You mean to tell me when he let a guy who was almost 15 years older than him, in a contested game, run all around him and score while he was just standing there he way trying? Start it from the beginning. He was getting away with offense fouls, but he was busting ass on the offensive end. As soon as things weren't going his way the intensity when down dramatically, especially on the defense end. What about here: https://youtu.be/3YsIisb9vhU?t=27 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saying he is well on his way, like it's inevitable, is silly. Sure, he'll probably be in the discussion, but he's only 23 years old. You are jumping the gun. At that point in his career, the greatest power forward of all time had already won a championship and was an all around better player. AD is the better scorer, but he's still got a long ways to go before he's mentioned with Timmy as the greatest power forward of all time. Even if you base it on stats, Timmy was better in statistical categories at the same age, and he's never been a guy who's value was based on the stat sheet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not just a stamina issue, it's mental. When they are losing, when someone scores on him, etc., he sometimes quits on defense. What's worse, after he quits on defense, if he doesn't get a call, if he doesn't score, he sometimes quits of offense. He's been doing it his whole career. Here is an example of Boogie quitting for the rest of the game (4 minutes left in a 4 point game) after Timmy blocks his shot and steals the ball: https://youtu.be/rVVaMEHmvAE?t=208 </TEXT>

I believe they gave Vitor a chance to retire and talk to the fans, he didn't do that, talked for a little, and they wrapped it up. They are on cable tv time. Joe is on ppv time, and he's as much a corporate shill as Stann, really no difference there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really think Pop knows his role and wants to fill it. Anything else that comes with success (fame) really doesn't interest him. He's an old school coach and a good person, period. The only time I met him and asked him for his autograph he said, "you don't want my autograph" and walked away from me. That's Pop. Pop knows it's about the players and the team, and I know he meant that comment (it wasn't just an excuse). He's not going to advertise about all the great things he does, you've just heard more about it as the media has decided to cover it. Pop has never changed.  </TEXT>

Not really and off-hand statement. An off-hand statement is something said without preparation. Grabbing your phone or computer, typing the message to shit on a guy while he's down, and then pressing enter is the definition of preparation. The statement couldn't have been released without him doing some preparation. To be sure, I am only disagreeing with the "off-hand statement" comment. </TEXT>
