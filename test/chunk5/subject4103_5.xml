	<TEXT> The harm is only readily apparent based on a particular worldview. If you hold a materialist reductionist worldview, you only focus on physical symptoms when concluding there is "harm". This is what secular humanists do. Catholics, with a properly disposed Catholic worldview, see the harm in extramarital fornication, sodomy, and masturbation as easily as the harm in bashing an innocent person's brains in. Because we aren't utilitarians nor consequentialists, but we recognize that harm involves being closer to or further from God, as evidenced by obeying His Commandments. The physical, mental, emotional, etc. "harm" as thought of by secular humanists is almost incidental to actual right and wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, and we did protest things like divorce when they were starting to be popularized. And we're still against it because it's still morally evil. It's just that nobody asks us about it anymore because they assume it's been settled by "progress" and that we'll just "catch up" eventually. Like with contraception. I imagine after popular culture has settled the issue of same-sex "marriage" in their own minds, they'll ignore Church teaching on the subject the same way they ignore Church teaching on the other issues. And marriage takes yet another blow to its true meaning and becomes more unrecognizable from its true purpose. And the Catholic Church will continue to be right, no matter what bizarre morphings the secular world tries to pass off as "marriage" in the future. </TEXT>

He basically said that if a gay prostitute has AIDS, using a condom to protect his clients may be a moral step in the right direction because he is taking the well-being of others into consideration and the act isn't inherently procreative regardless of contraceptive use. The media took the football for a pick-six and declared that the pope was fine with contraceptive use in some cases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The capability to receive the indelible mark of priesthood as conferred during the Sacrament of Holy Orders. If a woman were to have a bishop hold the same ceremony, no change would take place, and the Sacrament will not have occurred. As for reasons, since God (and angels) perceive the nature of things directly, rather than muddled through sensory input, I'd imagine they would know why this takes place only with males and not females, the same way it would be obvious to them that the Eucharist is the Body and Blood of Jesus. Jesus being a man was a fundamental part of Himself, and a person must share that aspect in order to share His priesthood. The exact mechanics behind this necessity are likely spiritual and not perceptible to us. If anyone in this thread knows the reasons better, feel free to elaborate. </TEXT>

Edit: Actually, let me amend this a bit. We did have armed guards outside of our schools for the next year or so, and I know at least one school (the Catholic one) still does. We also have armed and trained volunteers who guard religious ed classes and big parish events. I don't think arming the administrators would fly - they want to keep the two spheres separate - and they definitely don't want people armed anywhere near the place until they've been properly vetted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, there is something called a "Josephite" marriage, where the partners intend to abstain. A canon lawyer would know the specifics, but I'm pretty sure that the marriage could be given a decree of nullity still if it's never consummated if the husband and wife so choose. Obviously Joseph and Mary never took that route. I was referring to people intending on having sex and not ever having children, in my original comment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it boils down to the following:

1) Any sexual act done while not being open to life is sinful

2) If at the time of the wedding one or both of the partners is not planning to be open to life and accept all children that come as the fruit of the union, then no sacrament is ever conferred and the marriage is invalid. It never actually happened, so it could be given a declaration of nullity at any time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I was referring more in general. But my point was that every person is called to chastity, whether homosexual or heterosexual. If the integration of chastity is done correctly so that sexual desire is properly ordered in a person, then it shouldn't matter if that person is married or not, or homosexual or heterosexual.

I also don't think you intended it this way, but be aware that this same line of thinking was used during the clerical abuse scandals to discredit priestly celibacy, as though if child molesters had an outlet for their sexual frustrations they would have not committed their crimes. As the evidence shows, this is patently false.

Sexuality is a struggle for all people (except I suppose for those "sex-positive" people who see it as simply a pleasure exercise with no deeper meaning than a game of badminton), so we must continually master it, no matter our station in life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not homosexual here, but discerning priesthood and a life of celibacy. To begin I think that you're seeing a wife too much as a cure-all for your troubles. Disordered, lustful desires don't stop being harmful or sinful simply because they are directed toward the person to whom you are married. It is fully possible to use a spouse as an object to fulfill your lust rather than an image of God. Not all sexual desire is lustful, but all lust is sin. Marriage doesn't suddenly make sex a free-for-all. 

Also, there will still be temptations in this regard, and even moreso if you allow them to grow. Pornography, cheating, and the like will still be available, and the notion of having an "outlet" in a spouse to release pent-up sexual frustration is not only disordered but also doesn't fulfill its intended purpose. Feeding the beast only makes it stronger. We are all called to chastity, which is the integration of sexuality properly into the self. This is what the goal is. People who go into marriage expecting their spouse to serve as a release, in my experience, often wind up cheating, still using pornography, etc. A conversion of heart must take place in order to fully love one's spouse as a child of God.

TL;DR Everyone is called to holiness and chastity. Everyone. No exceptions, and it isn't impossible for anyone by the Grace of God. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One reason why I think Catholicism is true, or at the very least the people who came up with it believed it. I mean, if you're going to invent a religion to appeal to the masses, why not make it easier to understand? They already were working with a monotheistic God in Judaism, and many of the heresies are more intuitive explanations of how Jesus can also be God. The fact that we wound up with such a complex and mysterious Trinity is a point in favor of it actually reflecting a non-intuitive spiritual reality, I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the other hand, I do think a "package deal" of sorts should be available for things like visitation rights, power of attorney, and other legal benefits that are usually associated with marriage but don't imply conjugal union. As I understand it, these are often expensive and difficult to get on their own. It wouldn't quiet the majority of opponents, since I think ideological recognition and false equivalence between marriage and other relationships is the goal, but I think there could be legal benefit to having these contracts packaged in a civil unit that had nothing to do with marriage. Certain things would remain extended only to actual married couples, since, as you said, the state has a vested interest in stable families and production of children. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tend to think the difference is more attributable to culture than anything. When women are given free rein to be licentious with no negative social consequences, they seem to display the same proclivity to sin that men do in the sexual realm. Men may be more visual in this regard, but Magic Mike apparently got enough box office support for a third movie in the franchise, and I don't think it was anyone's intellect that was being stimulated by Channing Tatum's abs. I definitely think both men and women need to come to terms with this in order to help each other in our struggle for chastity. </TEXT>

Oh, and also she apparently thought that suffering had a redemptive quality and brought us closer to Christ. What a horrible (i.e. Catholic) ideology! And she spent a lot of the money given to her on churches and religious things instead of medicine, which is apparently strange for a religious sister. I guess she also accepted money from questionable sources like dictators, but I don't know much about that.

	<TEXT> I'm not sure I can really add much that others haven't already said, but I'll throw my hat in. Yes, it's completely normal. I bet if you talked to your friends all of them would also be questioning something or other in the faith. Those who aren't either will in a few years or are lying out of insecurity.

I started questioning at about your age, and started trying to justify the Church's beliefs with my own reasoning which was, unbeknownst to me at the time, largely based on secular humanism with little actual theology to back it up. If I couldn't reconcile a part of the faith with my own system, I threw it out and figured the Church just hadn't caught up to the world yet.

For whatever reason, it never really occurred to me that a 2000 year old institution might have just thought these things through a time or two in the past. I was working under the false narrative given by the world that religious people were just operating on blind faith with no reasoning behind it, and you were better off figuring things out yourself and making your own morality. But you wouldn't try to invent your own math or physics from scratch - it's best to look at what's come before and see the solutions to problems that have already been discovered and worked out. 

Once I did that, it all changed. I saw how much sense the Church's doctrines made when reasoned out, and how little foundation secular views had. They couldn't base their beliefs on anything objective, whereas the Church had God and His Word. Not to mention reason from Natural Law. That all made everything fall into place. I was a grad student in AI at a top Computer Science University, and when I started learning about the faith, I saw how reductionist all the assumptions were in the scientific community. You can still have science as a Catholic, but so many people want to make empirical evidence all that there is, when there's a far richer world we inhabit. Reducing it to simple particle and wave interactions takes away the beauty and meaning. You need to look at the world in a totally different light, which is very difficult for people born in an age where a materialist, empiricist outlook is basically assumed. Right now I'm a seminarian studying to be a priest, and I'm still fascinated by all the philosophy and theology I'm learning. It's really given me a much more complete outlook on the world.

TL;DR Questioning is healthy. Just make sure you're actually looking for answers instead of doubting for the sake of doubt. They're out there and easily accessible (though not always easy to understand). </TEXT>

"Obviously a suicide is the opposite of a martyr. A martyr is a man who cares so much for something outside him, that he forgets his own personal life. A suicide is a man who cares so little for anything outside him, that he wants to see the last of everything. One wants something to begin: the other wants everything to end. In other words, the martyr is noble, exactly because (however he renounces the world or execrates all humanity) he confesses this ultimate link with life; he sets his heart outside himself: he dies that something may live. The suicide is ignoble because he has not this link with being: he is a mere destroyer; spiritually, he destroys the universe." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello fellow CS masochist! I was originally going for my PhD as well, but I decided to get a Master's and get out of Dodge. Turns out I'm good at academia but hate research. Just couldn't get motivated for it. Maybe it was the lab I joined, maybe it was my disposition.But that's neither here nor there. My biggest recommendations are 

1) Choose by professor/research topic, not how big-name the school is. Read research journals and also focus on conferences. CS is different from many other areas in that the conferences can be almost as big a deal as the journals. 

2) Only keep going if it's something you know you love. If you would follow the field anyway, even if you had to do something else in your life - if you would read the material on your own and get excited about minor advances in obscure fields, you're probably a good fit. The best researchers are like that. I wasn't, and I had to force myself to do anything, and I realized it wasn't for me. I was one of the top performers in the classes at a top-level school (particularly in AI, which was my area), but it didn't mean squat for whether I should get the PhD. The best researcher I knew was a labmate of mine. The guy was a research machine. Published from his second year, and was on at least 4 or 5 papers every year after, usually as first or second author. He was always carrying around a different advanced math book every time I saw him on the off-chance some obscure area could apply to his research methods. Looking at him made me realize that it wasn't my calling, despite my smarts. Also I was coming back into full practice of the Catholic faith again, and was embracing the concept of vocation. I decided to go into teaching after and loved it (with some caveats), but still felt like I might be called to something else. Now I'm in seminary figuring out if that's what I need to be doing. So I guess keep an open mind along the way and figure out if a PhD is your calling. And keep in mind that nobody can make you stay on one path if you don't like it. </TEXT>
