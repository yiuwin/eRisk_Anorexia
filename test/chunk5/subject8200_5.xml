	<TEXT> I also think that the biggest contributing factor in life expectancy is "dental care". With good teeth, you can eat anything. It wasn't until the mid twenties that it really became a must to brush your teeth and go to a dentist. You will not see smiling people in pictures before the 1920's. </TEXT>

So, I went to Loblaws to get some stuff for tonight's dinner and noticed this lady was staring at me on the same aisle I was on. No biggie. I moved to the next aisle and here she comes again... STARING! So now I'm like, "WTF?!", but finish up my shopping and head to the check out line. Of course this same lady was ahead of me... and starts staring again. Awkward!!! So I start checking my cart so I don't have to look at her. Finally she says "I want to apologize for staring at you, but you look just like my daughter who just passed away." I felt really bad after that and gave her my condolences. She says "thank you but I have a favour to ask. I understand if you don't want to but can you give me a hug and say 'bye mama' to me?" Inside I was like "Whack job", but me being the softie that I am, I went ahead and did it. She smiles, thanks me, and leaves. The cashier rings up my stuff and the total comes out to $100.85. I knew something wasn't right, because it should have been like $40 or so. The girl tells me that my total was included with my mom's. I'm like, "What?!!!" she said, "Your mom said you were paying for her last few items along with your things. I told her that the woman was most definitely NOT my mom!!!! She said, well I saw you hug her and heard you call her mama. I flew out of the store looking for this witch, ready to beat her a@*. I see her loading up her car! She saw me and jumped in her car, I got to her as she was putting her leg in, and I started pulling her leg... JUST LIKE I'M PULLING YOURS!!!! Hope you all are having a wonderful day </TEXT>
