	<TEXT> Episode 1: Literally everything about it except for Liam Neeson and The Score. But I'll focus on the plot that is simultaneously thin while having too much detail and hingeing too much on a child actor.  
Episode 2: Lack of Chemistry between the leads, we get them talking at each other, not with each other. Plot is still thin.  
Episode 3: A romance that doesn't work, starring two people who lack any kind of chemistry, tied with dialogue that is extraordinarily clunky has to be the emotional heart of the film.  
Episode 4: Occasionally clunky dialogue with resulting stiff delivery EG "I recognized your foul stench when I came on board", Vader's first line when meeting Obi Wan again, etc   
Episode 5: Wasted potential on having a flying city and doing practically nothing with it.  
Episode 6: An almost audible disconnect between the first and act and the rest of the film. This result is moderate pacing issues especially around the middle act. The Ewoks felt out of place, these were supposed to be the empire's elite ground forces and they get taken out by furry midgets with rocks.    
Episode 7: Lacks of original plot or sufficient modification to the formula, the space battle climax also felt done.  
Rogue One: Chemistry was lacking between the main leads though no where near as bad as eps 1-3, too many characters with not enough insight into their motivations, Electronic Talking Tarkin </TEXT>

These days the only buffer state between China and the West is California, because all that made in China stuff has to land somewhere. Nevermind all the movies and consumer goods going in both directions.  
Korea being unified means that Samsung phones start showing up in Beijing by train instead of ship, nothing more.  
A few divisions of tanks being a few miles closer doesn't concern Beijing more than the bombers and ICBMs already pointed their direction. As is North Korea is only acting as a minor road block if a conventional shooting war breaks out. </TEXT>

This resulted in the smooshed irregular shape you see.  
The Ancient Chinese prefered to melt down the metal and pour it into a die, so their coins were a little more regular shaped. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Modern computers are all digital, meaning at the end of the day everything is a whole number, it's a sequence of definite ones and zeroes. Even things that seem like they are continuous smooth lines on a computer are just tiny jagged lines. This is because computers have to do things step by step and without infinite amounts of space and time available.  
Life has many continuous smooth lines. Numerical analysis is how you turn a continuous smooth line into a tiny jagged one. So Numerical Analysis is how you get computers to be close enough to real life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nature doesn't "know" anything.  
However some species can respond to sudden changes in gender ratios.    
Some produce pheromones based on what gender they are and that can change behaviors.    
For example, in all female populations of [Common Reed Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_reed_frog) certain individuals have been known to spontaneously change sex. You may remember that from Jurassic Park. Clownfish demonstrate the opposite effect, changing from male to female.    
But I'd hazard a guess and say that for most species gender birth ratios won't change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As elements get heavier they get harder to fuse into new elements.  
Eventually stars start building up these elements that are too heavy to fuse.  
However if something were to start fusing these elements, the heavier the element the faster it fuses.  
So if something starts fusing these heavy elements, it will happen quickly.  

For example another star might get sucked into the star, this new material increases the temperature in the core so that it high enough to kick start the fusion of heavier elements. So it's like crashing a truck full of gasoline into a nitroglycerin factory, boom.  

Now the energy of the continuous nuclear explosion of a star is actually pretty spread out. Each volume of a star is probably generating roughly the same amount of heat as a similarly sized human body, there's just a lot of star to generate heat.
However if it all stops, if for example the star runs out of fuel, the whole thing collapses. It keeps "falling" in on itself until it hits a physical law, quantum mechanics doesn't like neutrons being too close to each other, so it's like the atoms get slammed into a wall, and they get slammed by the ones outside potentially starting more fusion.  
So this would be like going to a nitroglycerin factory and knocking out all the load bearing columns.

	<TEXT> [Binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient)  
Used in combinatorics to among other things, count unordered sets.  
Usually read out loud as "n choose k"   
EG you have numbers 1-5, how many ways can you pick out 3 numbers, if 1 2 3 is the same as 3 2 1 and 3 1 2 etc, in other words the order doesn't matter just which numbers got picked.  
So you can use that to figure out how big your probability space is. </TEXT>

There are 48 possible sequences from the 50.  
So out of the 110^3 probability space only 48 are valid.

World War II happened because of World War I.    
We see the world in a transition from medieval to modern resulting in utterly bizarre mashups of the two, like [a German cavalry man with a lance, modern helmet and gas mask.](http://angloboerwarmuseum.com/images/boer/photos_bw/lancer_german].jpg) 
  
Almost all of the modern world's political conflicts come from World War I.  
For example: The Arab-Israeli conflict. That's what happens when you promise the same land to two different peoples in order to get them both to resist the Turks.

	<TEXT> Modern armor doesn't do very much against spears. Look up a "stab vest".  
The Marines still win though, because the Spartans kinda sucked in reality.  
No tactical flexibility. They were the Rock to the light archer Scissors, but flank em with anything remotely approaching shock and they're done.  
They won mainly because they were the only ones doing war as a day job, and still lost to Athenians and Thebans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 300 Marines, they have guns, the Spartans don't. 5.5645mm NATO goes straight through bronze armor.  
Restricted to bronze weapons, probably still the Marines. The Spartans are probably the most overrated fighting force on the planet, semi-frequently lost to Thebans and Athenians who, I might remind you, actually had real jobs and were just fighting during the off season.   
Thermopylae was also one of the most overrated battles, in an era where armies walked, a 3 day delay with minimal casualties is a rounding error compared to weather, terrain and disease.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually it's quite the opposite a handwritten signature is trivial to forge with a scanner,  and you can sign any name you want as well. A digital signature on the other hand does alot of things.  
But the biggest problem with a hand signature is that it doesn't do anything to safeguard the document. Say you sent the digital copy with just your hand signature and some hacker intercepted it. He could modify it to say you were a pedophile with a criminal record of terrorism and bank fraud, leave your signature alone and send it on it's way. The agency sees this modification thinks it's the information you wanted to sent, sees your 100% authentic signature  and you are in trouble.  
This can't happen with a digital signature, it's constructed in part with information on the document, so if the hacker changed a single letter on your information the signature is no longer valid. Because it's requires math and your secret information, he can't forge a new signature that matches the document.  
So the agency can be sure that someone claiming the name and email you gave actually did send that specific information. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't travel at the speed of light, according to our understanding of physics.  
But you can get close.  
You will see the bullet travelling forward at whatever muzzle velocity it had.  
Even if the gun had saaaay a 50% of light speed muzzle velocity, and you were travelling at 90% of the speed of light relative to another observer, you  still see the bullet travelling at 50% the speed of light away from you.  
The observer however, sees the bullet traveling faster than you, but slower than the speed of light.   
You'll also disagree on how far it traveled and how long it flew. 
This is because of time dilation and length contraction as you approach the speed of light. </TEXT>
