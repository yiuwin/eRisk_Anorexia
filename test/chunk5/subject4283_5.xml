	<TEXT> I'm trying to find one of those Pokemon RPG Maker software for a short comedy video on youtube. I'm looking for one where you can create a custom world from the original black and white games. Can anyone point me in the right direction (if this makes any sense at all) </TEXT>

Thanks for the response and that's not a bad idea, I forgot about skooma. I'll give that series a watch as well thanks.

	<TITLE> Oblivion Live Action Video Ideas? (Comedy) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm a filmmaker that loves the elder scrolls series and wanted to make a very short comedy video about oblivion specifically. 

I have access to a big forest and a couple actors but not a lot of great ideas. I have a guard outfit and was thinking of an idea revolving around criminal scum. 

Do any of you guys have any ideas that could utilise a forest? 

(I'll be sure to give you 100% credit if we end up using it. I also don't do this for profit, it's just good fun) </TEXT>
