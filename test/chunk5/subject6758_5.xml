	<TEXT> Yes it does. I know very well that humanity is one race with many ethnic groups however, the term is racism and race does exist. In what way doesn't race exist?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, it's not. Racism is when a person receives benefits/penalties solely because of their race. Racism is purely about race. That's why it's called racism and is pronounced as "racesism".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To answer your third question. If you are talking about fantasy then it's essentially different nations from our history that are "mashed" into one fantasy universe with magic, monsters e.t.c.

The overwhelming majority of Fantasy factions are inspired by their irl counterparts , The Empire of Man is inspired by the Holy Roman Empire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire), Bretonnia is inspired by medieval France, Estalia is inspired by Spain, Tilea is inspired by Italy/Portugal, Norsca tribes are vikings e.t.c. If you were asking about 40k, it's supposed to be our current universe/timeline but 20 000 years in the future.

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm a 40k player who is considering to start playing Age of Sigmar and I have a few questions about the Free Guilds/Free Peoples, the faction I'm considering to play.

1. What's their place in the AoS meta and how well do they stack up against other armies on the battlefield?

2. I was looking at some of their models like the Handgunners and Crossbowmen, and found them to have lackluster details so I was wondering if there are easy ways to give them more details, (upgrade packs, green stuff etc).

	<TEXT> It isn't really racist since muslims aren't a race. It might be ignorance,  but not racism. </TEXT>
