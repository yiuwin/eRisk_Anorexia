	<TEXT> I think he's trying to say the decisions characters make in Community make sense within the world the show takes place in whereas that is not true for TSCD

Couldn't have said it better myself. People are thrown into crazy situations all the time, of course, not as crazy as these situations, but it's how characters react to said situations that make them believable and relatable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the world does work that way, at least in the circle I find myself in. I try to surround myself with positive, happy people. I know that sounds like some hippy bullshit, but I just mean I cut off or avoid cynics. 

Life is so fucking short, we have to appreciate. One of my favorite episodes of Community is *The Psychology of Letting Go*. Like Jeff, I've deprived myself of sweets and carbs...I'm pre-diabetic! 

Community examines life in a happy way. It finds the good in people. Some people aren't like that. They embrace the nasty or the mundane, that's fine too. I guess I was projecting my own opinion as objective fact, and that's wrong. I apologize for that. 

Fuck, I want that movie... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, I don't think I explained myself well. The entire plot of TSCD revolves around this zombie disease where people act in the most irrational way possible for the sake of plot. 

For example, after everyone ate the *taco meat* and the outbreak broke out, Jeff wanted to escape (rational, true to his character) and Abed wanted to save everyone (rational, true to his character). 

In TSCD, Sheila doesn't have a fucking pulse and they don't go to the doctor after they notice it! Having been to the ER, nobody noticed it there either. First thing they do is check your vitals. 

Yes, Joel does go to meet the professor, but it's all executed so irrationally. One of crazy plots I can live with, but when the stakes are high and people just keep acting like idiots, nope.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I feel escapism works well in drama, but comedy should be somewhat grounded. Obviously, colleges don't have multi-day pillow fights, but I can believe almost everything that happens on Community would happen in real life. Shows like Community and The Office nail this concept. 

The Santa Clarita Diet...well, I mean...what the fuck? There is nothing funny about murder. If there was an actual zombie, this is not how any of it would go down. This is not how people would act. When the stakes are so high, when it's a matter of life and death, people don't do whatever the fuck they want!

Just my two cents. There are plenty of other reasons why Community is a superior show to TSCD but that fundamental inconceivability is the main one.  </TEXT>

Thank you all for your vigilance and dedication to the subreddit, though. We really appreciate it and it would be impossible to keep this sub clean without your help.

If you want to report a repost, please link the original post in the "Other" section of the report or shoot us a modmail. 

Thanks!
