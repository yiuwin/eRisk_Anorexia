	<TEXT> How come according to CNN it says 

"Santiago flew into Florida on a flight from Alaska via Minnesota on a Delta flight, officials said. He had declared his handgun in a firearms carrying case, law enforcement sources told CNN"

But Air Canada who flew him have no knowledge of a registered gun being on the flight or have no knowledge of him! Very strange.. 

Anyone care to expand? I'm confused.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first time I tried LSD was when I was in Germany. We went to a nightclub that was open for three days straight during new years eve, new years day, and the day after. 

I took 1/4 of a tab as the gent we purchased them from said they were very very strong so we decided to ease ourselves in. 

It was a good job, we dosed ourselves up ready for the night we was about to experience prior to going into the club. When I walked in I was in a totally new surrounding so I was a bit on edge but I was perfectly safe. 

This is when the drugs kicked in...

I walked in the club and I started to notice little unusual things.. I thought people were wearing make-up and that we were at a themed new years party. Turns out peoples faces were in fact not painted just the drugs had gave them a shiny colour. As anyone knows who has taken LSD before the high comes in waves. What I mean by this is, you ingest, you wait till you come up (this depends on your metabolism, what you've eaten etc) and then you start to notice colours are more vivid, you feel slightly more energetic, empathetic   well... high.. 

This happens ever so slowly, you notice it then it things slowly go back to normal then 10 mins later you can see things regaining their glow but it get's more intense, the music seems to encapsulate you. 

Long story short, stayed in that club till 9am the next morning. Knees   legs were aching due to my repetitive dance moves that I busted out for 6/8 hours..  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I go to visit my friend at work, go in have a chat. Come out, set off, little do I know I left my footstand down.. Footstand gets caught, leaves me with a wobble I try to brake, bike just slips. 

Second slip, I get up check my bike.. Broken my mirror dang, anyway I'm fine. Go again I go to put my down to stop, little do I know petrol has leaked and got onto my shoes. As soon as I put my foot down I slip again.. 

I clean my shoes (trainers, I now know boots are a must!!) Go to put my bike back, lock it up walking out of the garage, I slip on my ass.

Morale of the story, the day you don't wear your boots you'll slip   it'll cost you your mirrors. 


TLDR. Slipped bc of footstand, slippy gas   bad balance. 


Hope I cheered someone up! Didn't end up with a single scratch on me!  </TEXT>
