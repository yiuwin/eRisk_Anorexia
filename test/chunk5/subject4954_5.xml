	<TEXT> This is beautiful. Some of the more graphic pieces are reminiscent of minimalist art. Almost too beautiful for Youtube consumption--I can imagine this as a small installation in a modern art museum.

Nicely done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At least have the decency to close the lid on the toilet before snapping your selfie. Guessing by the look on your face, I bet it was a number two. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still remember the first time I saw Battleship Potemkin in a semiotics of film class and was blown away. Because Eisenstein was Russian he doesn't get a fraction of the credit he deserves in the States as one of the directors who created the rules that films would employ for decades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Troll 2! If you haven't seen it, please do yourself a favor. Best with a small group of friends and large group of beers. Every line delivered in the film could be on this reel.

Its relationship to the original Troll film (spoiler alert: there is none) is also a fascinating tale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There may be some truth to that, but there are also a bunch of kind people at Harvard who come from modest backgrounds and go on to contribute to society in important ways. The stereotypes don't all hold.

Plus you have Conan O'Brien and Rivers Cuomo (Weezer frontman). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If "business success" means climbing the corporate ladder, then I agree. I work inside a $10+ billion enterprise, and my anecdotal experience suggests it's not a meritocracy. Intelligence and solving problems isn't what gets people promoted again and again and again.

It's a game - like survivor. It's understanding how to use people, how to read what they want, to engender loyalty and build allies. It's coming across as genuine and caring, when we all know you're just playing the game.

EQ over IQ is definitely the main differentiation. Now, in other fields, such as research, science, software engineering I doubt my experience would hold up quite as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This stuff definitely happens. I've seen it in class, I've seen it with airline passengers. 

In college I worked at the computer helpdesk for a very prestigious business school, and I was initially shocked by the number of times a professor called us in to fix a machine that was riddled with porn. Even the associate dean. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife is a dance therapist (it's a legitimate licensed profession that requires a masters degree) and it's so inspiring to me to see the way dance and movement can bring joy and community to folks who have become disabled or are developmentally delayed.

Watching the choreography of a young man with cerebral palsy dancing in a wheelchair with friends, or the way young children with autism who can't communicate with others effectively but CAN dance inspiringly . . . It gives me so much more appreciation for dance than I had as a kid. </TEXT>
