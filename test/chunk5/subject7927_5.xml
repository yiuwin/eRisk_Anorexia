	<TEXT> Had a Siberian husky for just over 15 years... Passed away while I was at summer camp... Never got to say good bye... Maybe it was for the best I only have good memories of her....  

It's going to hurt for a long time but you will get over it eventually... 

I think for the next two years I still heard her for steps on our house it was so weird.. 

My parents actually took me to the pet store shortly after... I got a snake. 
I put him down a few months ago. But he gave me another 14 years of happiness. 


Sorry for your loss. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TIFU ... I just panic drove to work thinking I was late....not many cars on the road... This is nice. THEN I realized it's 2:30 in the morning not 5:30!!!!  FML back to bed I go!

[EDIT] Hello everyone..   back at home now....  I see you have lots of questions soooo... this is what happened ..
I don't get much sleep as it is..... 
Well this night... 
My boyfriend kicked me and I woke up..  I was running on less than 2 hours of sleep and looked at the clock and saw 5:30 and some how that registered in my head as late.... I jumped out of bed without even looking twice at the clock... I was on the road for about ten minutes and thought... well this is strange that there is not really many other people out right now.
I looked at the time on the dash board and saw 2:30 and I honestly thought I was so tired my mind was just playing tricks on me... I then picked up my phone to confirm and that's when I realized I was an idiot... 

So now returning back home at around 2:50 I thought who the hell is up right now that could basically laugh at my stupidness.. REDDIT is awake right now...   so since it LITERALLY just happened and I was half a sleep .. I originally wrote the title as "I drove to work when I should have been sleeping".. or something stupid but I realized I had to put TIFU... and that's where that title came from....  It literally was TODAY... not a story from a year ago like half the stories in this sub!

MMMKay! </TEXT>
