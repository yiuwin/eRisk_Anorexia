As had been predicted in that thread. At 203 in the pattern i received my magical chest earlier. This was helpful because I opted not to try new decks and ensure I remained in arena 7. Hope this helps others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright instead of being negative like some other comments, it actually seems like a neat idea. It's cool people can create these types of things. According to the XDA thread, battery life impact is minimal. I may try and put this to the test. If anything it's a nice "hey look what my phone can do" type of thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once you see how fast USB-C charges your phone, you'll never think about wireless charging again. Oh my phone's at 35%? I'll just plug it in 30 mins before heading out... suddenly it's back up to 80% which lasts a significant amount of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This basically. I never bother checking because I go from 8am to 11pm with ~30% remaining. I don't charge it overnight so I'm up the next morning at 6am with 28% battery left which get me to work where I'll charge it to full. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uhh sort of? Under the a good amount of light at a certain angle i can sort of a see a hint of a darker ring? I'm sure it'll come off if i clean it, but it's not really an issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been using cataclysm since my nexus 5. Carrying over to my nexus 6P made it feel like home. Haven't tried Chroma so i can't compare. Cataclysm installs onto of stock image which is nice. Swipe nav bar to sleep is my favorite features. Stable as always. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nexus 6P with 6.0.1 Cataclysm, can't remember when I last reset my phone, it's been at least a week. Can't notice a difference, even after reading your post I'm running tasks swiping around looking for a slowdown, nothing. Maybe it's an N6 6.0.1 issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It plays well into one of the theories about Rey being his daughter that was assumed dead, but in fact Kylo hid her from Luke because he couldn't go through with killing her at the academy. So what you're seeing is Luke realizing she's alive and him on the brink of crying. The only flaw here is Rey not knowing he's her father, but this could be countered by Kylo screwing with her mind at a young age. </TEXT>
