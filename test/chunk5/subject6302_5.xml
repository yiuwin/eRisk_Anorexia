	<TEXT> Greed: fitbit HR plus. I don't regret it for a second. 

Wrath: Crossfit... HEAR ME OUT. I want to try crossfit. I think crossfit is a great exercise. I hate it because I go to a standard gym with limited equipment and a lot of the crossfit people do crossfit outside the circuit training area and hog 4+ sets of dumbbells and 3+ stations during busy gym hours. So i guess you could say I hate crossfit done without gym etiquette. 

Gluttony: Cardio takes up most of my time and I hate it. 

Sloth: Squats as deep as they should be. I always do squats but I should go deeper. 

Pride: calves

Lust: Dat Booty (hence why i should do deeper squats.) 

Envy: Run fast for an extended period of time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never eaten a pint of ice cream in one sitting. It's surprising because I used to be very fat for many years and I know plenty of other people who would eat a pint of it with no problem, skinny or fat. 

I could eat 50 chicken nuggets in one sitting but I never had the "fat girl crying and eating a tub of ice cream" experience. Not even with just a pint.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have two.

Friend one got married and had a baby and then proceeded to cheat on her husband up and down while he was deployed. When he got back they divorced and he got the kid. When I asked why he got sole custody she said it was because she was in the military (she is) so they would not allow her to have custody... Which is weird because he is in the military too and he got custody. 

Then she banged her way through a bunch of guys for two years, which is totally fine by me. That isn't inherently wrong, I just had a problem with it when she was married. It's only worth mentioning because she recently fell for a super christian dude and completely revamped her facebook to make her look like a holy-roller. Now she is constantly posting about praying for the souls of loose women and how she is always going to church. She's also always posting crap about how to make your relationship/marriage work and how divorce is never an option... but she's divorced... And she wants to start trying to have kids with this guy as soon as they get married but she never talks about her son and the few times she has, she's just mentioned how annoying he is when she has to go see him. (he's like five)

Friend number two is one of those vague-booking attention seeking girls. She got married around seven years back. After that she was always posting really vague statuses that seemed like they were aimed at her husband. Passive-aggressive crap. Anyway, they got separated after a year and she would call me to vent about how much she hated him and how he was a terrible father and a drug addict and how he would not work or get a job. She kept telling me how she just wished he would die because it would make the divorce process so much easier. 

Then he OD'ed on heroine (No, she didn't kill him, I swear). All of a sudden on facebook they were "soul mates" and "so in love" and he was "such a good dad" and "such a hard worker". She even told people he died in an accident (which is technically true but she made it seem like a car accident or something). She just went on and on and on about how her life was over and how she would never recover. She got married nine months later. 

It's been five years since he died and she has had her second child with the second husband and she still posts weekly about her dead ex husband and how much she misses him and how she will never get over it, all to lap up the sympathy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the USA, a beaker is (as far as I know) exclusively used for chemistry. 

like so: http://imgur.com/X4c2XoZ

I've been re-watching "Keeping Up Appearances" (A show I adored as a child) and noticed they use the word "beaker" when referring to a cup that is not a tea-cup. When I googled the use of the word beaker in England, google said it was a cup without a handle, but I thought for sure they were referring to "mugs" as beakers also in the show, and mugs have a handle. 

what we call mugs in the USA: http://imgur.com/4L6XOVH

	<TEXT> I worked with a girl who was really creepy about this one dude we worked with. He was a sweet dude and super hot. She was about ten years older than him and extremely unattractive (very overweight, teeth like a picket fence etc.). She was sweet enough but she followed him round like a dog and blatantly hit on him to the point where it was unprofessional and embarrassing. He always nicely shot her down and was still nice to her because he's a good dude. He was 21 and finishing up college and headed for better things in his life and she was pretty uneducated and happy with her dead end job. All of this is to say that he was out of her league and they were not a good match. 

Anyway there was a party after work one night and I didn't go but apparently both of them were there. Like a dumb-ass he got blackout drunk and was on the verge of passing out. He went to a bedroom to go lay down and she went in there after him and basically raped him. I don't think he fought her off or said no, but I'm not sure he was conscious either. So yeah, she raped him. 

Anyway, she got pregnant.... with twins. That's all I know because I moved away. I felt so bad for him. He never reported her. He should have but I live in a part of the country that is big on "machismo" and I think he was too embarrassed to admit a woman raped him. One of my friends who stayed there longer than me says he looks dead inside.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like staying home. 

I'm 27 years old, in graduate school, living with my wonderful boyfriend and our six year old daughter. She just decided to watch all the star-wars movies this evening (we'll see how far she gets before she passes out!) after she saw the trailer for the new one. Obviously being six, I'm going to watch it with her to explain parts that might be confusing to her. I can think of nothing I'd rather do on a Friday night. 

But hey, I'm a simple gal. I just never feel alone with family and I'd never been big into the party scene. Might have a few drinks with my man once little one goes to bed. Perfect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me it's not necessarily about being in the same place at the same time, as much as it is about trajectory. 

My ex husband ended up not matching up with my trajectory. We met as young stupid kids. The only problem was that I grew up (went to college, worked full time, graduate school etc) and he stayed the same (smoked pot all day and couldn't hold down a job and he was fine with it). I was going to school to be a teacher so I wasn't really at the right income to have a stay-at-home husband. When I thought about our future it would depress me because I knew we would struggle our whole lives. Still, I was willing to stay because I loved him. We got divorced because he cheated a bunch.

Now, I've been in a serious relationship with a very motivated man who is 10 years older than me. He has a good paying career and he's going back to school again on top of it. Meanwhile I'm finishing up my masters and starting my teaching internship (unpaid) and I feel like right now, we may be in different places (he's more successful than me, for now) but I see our trajectories will match up eventually. I feel happy and confidant about our future. The fact that he doesn't cheat helps.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Ultra thin, damaged wavy hair. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-14 19:44:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was born with incredibly thin hair. My natural color was dirty blonde/ light brown. I started coloring my hair a darker red at age 13 because my hair was so thin that when the sun would shine through it you could see my scalp, and the darker color helped disguise that. I've been coloring it red every 8 weeks since then (I am now 27). I never use anything with bleach in it.


At 16 I got diagnosed with hashimoto's disease. This makes your hair even thinner and also makes the hair dry brittle and extremely breakable. Being the dumb 16 year old I was, it was around this time that I started blow-drying and straightening my hair every day.


I stopped using any heat on my hair at all for about year now. I'm trying to get it to grow longer without breaking off. The length you see in the photos is about as long as my hair gets. I have not had a haircut in over two years. It just breaks off at this length.
I use L'oreal Paris Total Repair Extreme Reconstructing Shampoo once a week, and the same conditioner about 4-5 times a week. Maybe once a week I will straighten my hair with the heatless method of putting it into a chain of hair-tyes and letting it dry like that over night. Other days it will be in a loose pony tail or bun. I'd like to be able to embrace my curls but when I let them dry naturally or with a little product, it just looks messy because I have different kinds of curls all over my head. Some are loose and some are tight.

I know my hair looks super damaged, and it is, but I've been extremely careful with it the past 18 months. I'm thinking of switching to henna dye to stress it out even less. Most of the dry brittle look seems to be from my autoimmune disease. From the age of 18-21 I actually didn't color it or use heat on it at all and even from pictures around that time it still looks like straw.
Help?

IMAGES

In the first two you see my hair with no product. I just let it air dry right out of the shower. The third picture is ALL of my hair in hair tie so you can see just how incredibly thin it is. The last picture is is I brush my hair once it dries. Looks horrible. </TEXT>

One of my friends online (also in the military) was talking about some "women in combat" issue and I weighed in. One of his buddies I didn't know (also in the military) asked me if I was in the military and I told him no, but my boyfriend is and we had discussed the issue before so I felt like I had somewhat of a grasp on it. I guess the dude went on my profile and saw who my BF was. It's pretty obvious he is older than me. That and, I have a baby face. I've been asked if he's my dad twice. 

Dude proceeds to tell me I'm a "dependapotamus" who is leaching off her military bf and is too stupid to contribute to a discussion. Was fun watching our mutual friend tell him about my two jobs and Master's degree.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh an education degree isn't really worthless. There has to be teachers. Obviously if I cared about being rich I wouldn't want to be a teacher. I understand why you are angry though. Every time I go to CVS someone is yelling at the pharmacist. Must be a tough job. I might go home and yell at people in Reddit too if I did that. I don't want to be a pharmacist though so I guess it's different for you. I make an alright amount of money doing freelance writing for now. It's nice to be able to make money doing something I love. 

Honestly I have so much better dirt in my history than my job that I love and my higher education. You just have to dig more. As for digging to find your steak thread, I really didn't have to.

	<TITLE> Scared to put weights over my head again after an injury </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-02 18:44:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> About 11 months ago I was doing an overhead press at the gym and my right shoulder (that had dislocated dozens of times before doing other random things) dislocated and the weight fell behind me, jerking my shoulder really hard. I managed to pop it back into place and then went in my my car cried for about ten min, and then drove to the hospital. Before this it had not dislocated in close to a year and NEVER while I was lifting because I had always been so careful. 

I had to have surgery and wasn't allowed to lift again for about nine months. Soon after I was cleared to start again, I lost my health insurgence. Every time I tried to start lifting again after that, I've been getting frustrated. Any time I do shoulder exercises with anything over five lbs, my shoulder clicks really loud. It doesn't hurt but it's disconcerting and my shoulder gets tired really fast. Even my boyfriend who has been lifting for close to a decade says it's unnerving to hear. 

Even when I do exercises that don't directly engage my shoulder (like bench press or dead-lift) I feel like my lifts suffer because my shoulder gets so tired so fast.  I've quit lifting and started over again many times. I just get so frustrated at the slow pace and all my lost strength. 

I'd quit for good and just stick to cardio but I just loved lifting so much in the past and it helped me tremendously years ago when I was struggling with an eating disorder. Lifting had bee invaluable to me in the past. I get jealous when I see other girls talk about lifting and their PR's. 

On top of that I refuse to do any lifts that put weight over my head because I'm terrified of getting hurt again, even though my shoulder is most likely fine. Is it possible to get every muscle group worked properly without ever putting  weight over your head again? Or should I work on getting over the fear? I'm fine with squats and such it's just when the weight is over my head and is solely supported by my arm(s) that I have trouble.  

Is popping always a bad sign? Have any of you gotten over a serious injury? How do you mentally power through it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, but some (not all) teachers refuse to grade you individually on group projects. Since the teacher basically pulls names out of a hat for your group, you are SOL if you get stuck with a shitty team. Then you get a shit grade based on luck while the other natural-leader gets a better grade because he got more natural-cooperators.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a group member ask me how to open a pdf file yesterday. She also needed me to walk her through how to get to the group forum, and English was not her first language. This is common at my school because it's a boarder city and they offer classes in both English and Spanish. Even though this class is in English we get a lot of students who still (understandably) struggle with it. I wish this was the first time something like this has happened. That doesn't even bother me as much though, as other people's unwillingness to cooperate.

I do my work in advance. I get anxiety if I put something off till the last second. I never procrastinate. On top of this I have two jobs and a six year old. I work ahead because some weeks, my schedule has almost no wiggle room. Making sure other people do their work, answer emails on time, make it to online meetings and understand their role in the project, is like pulling teeth. 

It's not *me*. It's not that I have not *figured out* how to use skype and a message board. It's that I'm sick of *other* people not doing their job. That's the essence of my problem with group work is other people, NOT that I don't understand technology or am lazy or unwilling to learn. I wish shitty group members were the exception and not the rule, but after six years in college (almost have my master's) it's just not the case. I'm sick of being everyone's mother. They need to grow the fuck up and the burden should not be on me to hold their hand through it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good advice. I already emailed him though so now I'm waiting for a reply. This isn't my first rodeo, I'm nearly done with my master's degree and I have a 3.8 GPA (not perfect but I'm alright with it) so I know how to manage my time appropriately. I'm just here because there is nothing left to do but wait. I'm actually already finished with all my other work until Friday. 

I asked him if I could just do the 10-person project myself. That's how much I hate group work. This is also one of those dual classes that has underclassmen and upperclassmen in it. The uppers have a few extra assignments here and there to warrant the master's degree credits, but this group project is for both uppers and lowers and I got stuck with 8/10 freshmen. I'm seriously working with kids that are the same age as the students I substitute-taught last year. 

(BTW if any of this sounded snarky I didn't mean it like that. I'm just frustrated. Your advice is very good advice.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mother worked at a WLS clinic for years. She told me the gastric sleeve was the one she liked best. (She never had surgery, she just worked there and met hundreds of people who had.) 

She said the gastric bypass worked very well but most of the people had trouble with getting adequate nutrition afterwards and looked really tired. She said the sleeve patients lost almost as much (if not as much) as the gastric bypass ones but they had nowhere near the undernourishment problems. 

She said the lap band was the worst. Worst surgery, worst symptoms, worst results and highest level of gain-back. She hated it. The failure rate was enormous and they suffered the most.

I know most people go for the band because it's not "permanent" but IMHO if you are considering something as invasive as surgery, you should be sure enough to get something permanent or not risk it at all. No half measures.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really appreciate the response. For real. I'm always so happy when people put in the effort to respond to threads. I realize what the process of being diagnosed is like because I've been through it and I'm on t4. I also totally agree about how people use it as an invalid excuse, especially after they are cured as long as they are on medication. 

Still, I was more interested in how it works/causes weight gain when someone is not on medication. Do you know about why a slower metabolism causes weight gain? If the metabolism was slower wouldn't that person naturally eat less? I'm more interested in the effects of the disease on the body and how hunger/eating/calorie burn works in conjunction with that and less about how to get diagnosed and how society deals with it/ uses it as an excuse. 

I'm really worried this response is coming off bitchy and I don't mean it like that, I just wanted to know if you knew more about the biological side of it. I'm afrid my original post wasn't clear enough.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do PCOS and Hypothyroidism really work? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-23 16:23:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have PCOS and Hashimoto's Hypothyroidism. I've lost 130 lbs and I'm fit and not overweight anymore. Still, I'm wondering how these conditions effect the body and how they *actually* work. 

I'm not interested in fat logic or excuses. Just a deeper understanding on how PCOS and hypothyroidism actually effect weight. I know one can lose weight with both issues because I've done it. I know calories in vs. calories out works (though I'm not sure if all my counting and burn calculations in the past are 100% accurate, or if it was harder/easier for me than it is for someone without these issues, but I doubt it).

Do people with these conditions get hungrier and eat more than other people due to hormone imbalance and thus gain weight because they eat more? Are we more sedentary because perhaps we experience fatigue?  I doubt we process calories differently, but am I wrong?

I've read that these issues really only account for 5-25 lbs of excess weight, so being severely overweight is not an excuse, but why does it account for even that much extra weight? 

When I was diagnosed with hashimoto's hypothyroid 11 years ago and put on medication, my doctor told me I would lose weight. I didn't back then because I still ate like a pig (and that's on me), but what exactly did the medication correct that caused the doctor to think I would lose weight?

Not looking for medical advice, just trying to understand these issues on a deeper level. 

EDIT: I've read that hypothyroid issues cause a lower than normal BMR, but wouldn't the average person with a lower BMR naturally eat *less* because they get hungry *less* because they burn *less* ? Or is that not how hunger works?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just not as well.

I'm lucky in that I actually really enjoy cooking and my mother taught me a lot of basics. Still, as you learn to do more and more things from scratch, it gets cheaper. 

Maybe you're making a dish with beans. A beginner might use canned beans while one with more skill might buy the beans in a bag and make them themselves. It's a small difference but if you do that with a bunch of things over time it adds up. I make my own bread, biscuits, tortillas, muffins and cakes from scratch. Maybe at the beginning you buy biscuits from the bakery. Then you graduate to buying the tube of dough. Then you make your own dough from scratch. 

Maybe when I first moved out, I'd buy a cake and it would cost me 10$. Then I started baking a cake with the box mix, which was like 3.50$. Now I do it from scratch and it maybe adds up to 1$-2$ (though it's hard to tell exactly unless I sit down with a calculator). 

Certain foods tend to cost more if they are easier. You're basically paying them to save you the time/effort. If you're willing/able to take the time/effort and you have the knowledge to do it, you can save a lot of money.

	<TEXT> Every capable adult with the proper facilities, man or woman, should learn to at least cook the basics. Saying "That's not fair because I can't cook" isn't an excuse.That's like saying it's not fair that you have a higher risk of dying from heart disease because nobody ever taught you to exercise. It's easy to learn and the benefits are enormous. Saying you don't enjoy cooking isn't an excuse either. I don't like doing laundry, but it has to be done. Cooking is vastly cheaper and usually healthier than eating something out of a package. 

I think the only excuse for not cooking is if you can afford to have someone else do it for you, and if you can afford that then the poverty line doesn't directly apply to you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm divorced. 

I've never wanted a wedding. When I got engaged my mom *begged* me to have a small reception. There wasn't even a ceremony. I agreed as long as she did all the planning. In her defense she was wonderful. Unfortunately the DJ (who was married to the wedding planner) got caught cheating the day before my wedding and neither of them showed up. So it was chaotic and my brother ended up scrambling to download all the songs on my playlist and we just used some speakers and his ipod. In the end it turned out fine. 

The whole thing was about $2,500, which my parents payed for. I kept it insanely small. I've been divorced for over six years and things are getting pretty serious with my current bf. My dad keeps yelling that "I won't pay for another wedding!" even though I've told him 100 times I don't want another wedding and I didn't want the first one to begin with. 

My parents are very well off BTW, so it's not like the $2,500 wedding they demanded I have, broke them or anything. Jesus, I sound so fucking spoiled. I just really hate parties and planning and  everything to do with weddings. I was sick with worry the day of and for like two weeks before the wedding.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm learning about the middle passage right now and the terrible conditions the slaves were put in. I've tried googling it and have not found anything so I was wondering if someone could help me out. 

Were they allowed to move at all? Where did they go to the bathroom? Some of the journeys took two years. If they were not allowed to move, wouldn't their muscles atrophy? The conditions seemed so horrific that I'm surprised only 15% died on the journey.  </TEXT>

I guess I kind of feel bad for her, but I washed my hands of it after I showed her what a scumbag he was and she stayed. I mean, I stayed for way too long too, so I can't hold it against her too much, but it's hard watching someone make the exact same mistakes you did.

	<TEXT> I cheated on my husband (now ex husband) because he would not stop cheating on me. After catching him with seven different women and countless men, after the last time I caught him, I went out and cheated on him and then came home and told him just to make him see how it felt. 

Then, a few years after we split, he met a new girl. (We were still in each other's lives because we have a kid together). I met her and thought she was really nice and felt bad for her. I later texted him and asked if he wanted to hook up and he said yes and I took a screen shot and sent it to her. 

You'll just have to take my word for it, but I was not jealous and I did not want him back. I'm in a very happy relationship with the man of my dreams. I just wanted her to know what she was in for and I wanted to hurt him. Obviously wanting to hurt him isn't respectable, but that's the truth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a freelance writer for a sports betting company in the Philippines. I write about and manage several English-speaking facebook pages for them (My BA is in English). They pay about 1,300$ USD a month, which isn't much but it's good considering it equates to about 32-46$/ hr. I'm on the cusp of a promotion too, but for now it's perfect for me because I make enough to cover my half of the bills, have plenty of quality time with my daughter and my boyfriend, and lots of time to work on my master's degree (I'm on a scholarship so I don't have to pay for that either.) 

In all honestly if things keep taking off with this job (I'm on a track to move up rather quickly) it's going to be hard to take the pay cut when I switch to working as a High School Special Education English teacher, but I've wanted to do it for a very long time so I think I still might. Who knows, maybe I can do both. I *really* need something that gets me out of the house more and I *really* want to help kids with dyslexia. I have it very severely and was illiterate until 3rd-4th grade.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Age really is "just a number" (as long as they are legal I mean) but people do tend to act like their age group more often than not. 

Is it creepy? No. Even if she acted her age or younger, it's not creepy (assuming she isn't mentally disabled). She's an adult, you're an adult. Creepy is the wrong world. Maybe it's just that it doesn't feel like the right kind of relationship because she acts her age and you act your age. Just like a five year gap between a 15 and a 20 year old feels bigger than a gap between a 20 and 25 year old, there tends to be less of a gap in the same amount of years as you get older. (Obviously a 15 year old dating a 20 year old is wrong, it's just an example)

My boyfriend is 37 and I'm 27. It feels 100% normal for us. Now, I might act a few years older than my age and he acts a few years younger, but bottom line,  at our age, ten years ins't that big of a difference for *us* maturity-wise and it's never been "creepy".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She needs hobbies, especially if you guys don't have kids yet. I actually have a job but I work from home and it only takes up maybe 10 hours a week at most (usually closer to 7). I'm also in graduate school. I have a six year old daughter who is in school and my boyfriend works full time. 

I'm a highly social person and I did not realize how much of my socializing was derived from my previous job. I've also always had slight issues with depression and that has gotten a lot tougher now that I don't have a reason to regularly get out of my house and socialize. (All my classes are online too). I have a lot of hobbies and it helps. Exercise, baking, writing, reading, art etc. It's hard for me to get out of the house and hang out with people because in my head I always convince myself i'd rather stay home, still I'm really lonely.

	<TEXT> Kinda leaves children and property up in the air though. (I know this is crazy ideas because the ideas are crazy, but I'm just spit-balling here.) 

At least where I'm from, when a couple with kids originally separates, it's pretty much like the wild west. Whoever "grabs" the kids first wins. (I'm oversimplifying.) Like, I had a friend who's wife up and left with his son while he was at work. For six months she refused to let him see his son, and there was no law saying she had to let him. They were not divorced, just separated, so there was no laws about visitation and custody. He actually convinced her to finally meet him at McDonald's so he could see his son. His plan was to grab the kid and bolt into his car with him, but once he saw his son he realized how traumatic that would have been for the kid, so he didn't. Once they got officially divorced, then their lawyers worked out the law and visitation. 

It's like legal divorce forces couples to work out a legal plan to how everything/everyone-one is going to be separated. If the divorce just "kinda happened" there would be all sorts of things to figure out like who got the house/kids/car or whatever. Seems like whoever was home at the time could screw their partner out of everything by simply changing the locks and shit. 

Everything about your idea sounds great to me up until you factor kids/debt/house into it, then I feel like there needs to be some legal hoops to sort out. Maybe put a kids/debt/property clause where anyone with a kid(s) or X amount of debt or X value of shared property required an actual divorce. Or else just make it so there can never be two names on anything (house, cars loans) and have them agree on what to do if they ever separated right after the kids are born at the hospital and put it on the birth certificate.  </TEXT>

http://i.imgur.com/RQ1XJ5Q.jpg

I'm at a normal weight and yet my feet are still really wide and my toes are like sausages and the nails tilt up instead of laying flat like most toenails I've seen. I get a lot of pain in my big toe every time I exercise, even if it's just for 30 min. I even went to a running shoe store and got these shoes the guy swore up and down were deep toe box, and it still hurts. I've googled "Deep toe box running shoes" and all the pictures that come up still appear to have an average depth of toe box. 

I most likely need wide shoes with a wide and deep toe box. I feel like a damn Sasquatch. Tricky part is my feet are not particularly long (size 8 women's) Any suggestions? I'd really like to not pay over 130-140$

EDIT: I cut my toenails as short as I possibly can without getting an ingrown nail (which I'm prone to) but it still hurts.  </TEXT>

I know all the characters have good and bad traits, I'm more curious to hear from those of you who like her a whole lot less as a person (not plot device) than some of the other characters. 

so maybe something like "I don't like her because she fucked Ted." as opposed to "I don't like her character because her scenes are boring." So more commentary on how you would feel about her as a real person rather than her effect on the story.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom is a bit sexist. I think it's unintentional because her mom is suuper "old school" sexist, so *my* mom is a much more watered down version. Her mom got mad at her for having a career and my mom got mad at me when I let my husband change our infant daughter's diaper. 

When I was growing up I had to do all the ironing and cooking and cleaning (when I was old enough) and my brother had to mow the lawn, which to me was really unfair because the lawn took an hour on a Saturday while my chores felt more continuous. My brother helped me though, but that's because he's awesome, not because he had to. I bore the brunt of most of the housework though. 

When we have family gatherings, all the men and kids get to converse and the women are in the kitchen working on some enormously elaborate meal. (Cooking is a big deal in our family). After dinner the men got to play games and shoot the shit and we had mounds of dishes to do. 

When I started looking for a daycare for my daughter, my mom told me over and over to never put her in a facility that hired men. I ignored her and one of the best teachers she had was a black man. (I only mention his color because racism has also been slowly watered down through our generations. My great grandma would never talk to a black man, my grandma would talk to them but never hire a black man, my mom would be friends with but never allow her children to date a black man. I honestly don't give two shits what color anyone is. I dated a black guy in High School but my parents never knew). 

My mom criticized my body and eating habits constantly and I developed an eating disorder. My mom also has serious body issues. Her mother is senile now but she often gets on these loud ranting tangents in the nursing home, calling all the other women there fat. 

If a woman we knew cheated on  man it was like an act of treason. If a man cheated on a woman he was still a scumbag but there was  that hint of "well they have more trouble controlling it."  Like if a woman threw herself at a married man for a long time, then what could he have possibly done to prevent that? 

My mom always told me that if I was fat or disorganized or didn't clean or cook well enough, that my value was less and how could I possibly expect to get a good husband. The guy I ended up marrying was total shit (we're divorced now) but I think that had more to do with her always picking me apart and destroying my self esteem. I was always too fat, nothing was ever clean enough, nothing was ever done right, how could I expect to find a good man? Instead of becoming "better" I just accepted that I didn't deserve a good man. 

I love my mom to bits and the older she gets, the more she realizes how she was raised was wrong. I pity her upbringing because her mother is 100X's worse and I might honestly dance on her grave when she dies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish. I relapsed into bulimia in August and now we're into a year later.

 I went back to therapy and severely reduced the purging, but I have not had a purge-free time span worth talking about. I had literally almost went four years without purging before I relapsed. Now it feels like I can't accumulate time the way I used to. Still, the help gives me the strength to purge less. 

The only thing that will help launch your weight loss into the stratosphere (in my experience, I'm HORRIBLY unqualified to talk on this) would be hitting rock bottom.  

I literally had to admit I was murdering mysekf before I would pipe back up. I feel like taking the expirience extremely seriously was the only thing that helped.  </TEXT>
