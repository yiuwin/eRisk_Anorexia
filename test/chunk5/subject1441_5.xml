	<TEXT> Are you eating enough during the day?  I've had this happen to me when restricting. Your brain won't let you sleep because evolution makes it want to forage for food. 

Also, what is it that you're eating at night?  If you hunger signals are fucked up, it can be hard to tell if you're actually hungry. Are you able to eat something super healthy and nutrient dense and go back to sleep or does it have to be a salty/ sugary highly palatable food? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a super common eating disorder thought. Please remember that you will never be sick enough for your disorder. Also, just because you feel physically healthy doesn't mean that you are. Your body has adapted to the damages so you don't notice. Furthermore, there could be something medically destructive to you that you can't feel yet. Like a heart issue for example. Please please talk to your doctor because even if there is nothing medically/ physically wrong with you, the fact that you are in mental anguish is enough. Mental illness sucks that way in that you usually look like not a thing is wrong with you when your brain is beating you up. You deserve to feel better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was she still in the hospital when you made these calls?  Some wards don't let you use your phone. Plus, she may have been so sick at that time that she doesn't remember much and was unable to communicate with the outside world. I honestly remember very little from my lowest points. The brain just gets too starved. 

Could you send a text just letting her know you are thinking about her and if she ever wants someone to joke around with, you're there?  Or some little inside joke type thing?  She may be more receptive now that she has more nutrition in her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This hits home for me because I feel like this almost could have been written by my friend. Slightly different circumstances, but a similar idea. So obviously, I am not your real life friend, but I think I can speak from her perspective a little bit. Feel free to ignore if way off:

First and foremost, you did not cause your friend's eating disorder. This is absolutely 100% impossible. The ED made her isolate herself and distance herself from you. She is not the ED and it often helps to think of the person and the disorder as separate entities. 

I think you did a kind and brave thing reaching out to her mom like that. I think the next step is reaching out to your friend. You don't even have to talk about the Ed, but speaking from experience, recovery is isolating and scary. You long for someone to talk to- a peer. In treatment, you do nothing but talk about the disorder and it's nice to have someone in the "outside" to talk about normal things with. Not that you should ignore her disorder or pretend it isn't there, but start the convo with normal stuff and let her know that you are there to listen about the ED stuff too if she wants to talk about it. 

As your friend recovers, she will regain her true self. She will be different because the recovery process changes you, but at the core, she will be the same. I really hope you guys can rebuild your friendship because it sounds like you both really care about each other.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seeing the number is only a minor issue for me but it was really hard for some of the girls I was in treatment with. They worked with their therapists to do weight exposure therapy. Basically, they started out by just seeing their weight on a graph (which was inevitably stable or restoring at a normal pace).  Once they were comfortable with that, they were told the number after being weighed with the safety of therapy. ERP pretty much. Finally, they were allowed to see the number on the scale. This process moved at their pace as they because desensitized to the number. It was also strongly in conjunction with therapy to prevent the number from triggering ED.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it goes to the midsection first. The way I understand it is that the body wants to keep its organs running and protected. Fat does both of those things so it gets the weight to the middle. A lifting program has really helped me cope with this because I'm building muscles in my extremities and that seems to be helping the weight distribute. I'm the not quite the same weight I was pre-AN (actually still working on restoring) but I look like the pillsbury dough boy with toothpicks stuck in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, major props for taking this on with school. You've undoubtedly worked hard to get to the point you are at now where you're actively trying to restore weight. I second what the other commenter said about nuts and stuff. They have been my best friend. Caloric drinks are helpful too. You can pack a wallop in a milkshake or smoothie and it looks like a totally normal thing to randomly be drinking. That helps me feel less like I'm constantly eating at work and others are not.    Along the lines of the caloric milk, it helps to find other ways to sneak in dense calories. Put extra peanut butter on your sandwiches or use more bitter than normal. Good luck with your recovery! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey friend, I've had those thoughts too. I find it helpful to counter then with thinking of the things I don't miss. Or if I can't come up with those in the moment, thinking of the things I couldn't do when I was sick. I couldn't play basketball competitively because I was always dizzy. I couldn't show off my cool clothes because I was too cold to take my coat off. Etc. 

Keep up the fight because you deserve to feel healthy and enjoy feeling healthy. You can always message me to rant if you need to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in the same boat. I have a little left to restore so I need to gain weight on it, but I'm afraid I'll gain more than I need to die to the drug. Stupid irrational fear.

My best friend said something similar, though. She doesn't have an eating disorder but just got out of the hospital from other mental health issues and was saying that she was afraid she's gain a lot of weight on her new med, but then she decided that even if she did, it would be worth it for a real life and general peace of mind. So I'm trying my best to embrace that mindset because I really do want to be free of this damn disorder.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in an inpatient hospital type setting but I'd guess there would be some overlap with banned stuff. We weren't allowed food/ gum, celebrity magazines, sharp objects (including razors), plastic bags, alcohol/ drugs (duh), and then no obvious Ed stuff like dieting pills, laxatives, and scales. We also couldn't bring our own meds. Everything was given to us from prescription to OTC. 

You'll want to bring comfy clothes. Maybe one set of presentable things if your program includes outings. Slippers and blankets are a must. You'll want books and things to spend time on. People were into knitting and puzzles. Games are good too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The idea of going inpatient is scary and it sucks about spring semester coming up. But will you be able to enjoy and flourish in school if you're putting all of your energy into battling the ED on your own?  I was super against going IP myself, but it was honestly really helpful. It sucked, but it got me kick started. How long would you have to be in for?  I was only 8 days and then I did PHP which is nice because there's still some room for real life. 

My guess is they're pushing you to go in because they are noticing a pattern or something. That's what really got them to push me. Medical instability and a general downward trend.  </TEXT>

But anyway, background on the divorce: it's not terribly surprising.  My sister won't be shocked to hear it, but it's still going to make my already strained family life a little more awkward.  And it's still a change even if we were on some level expecting this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there. I'm sorry you're having such a rough time. That's awful that your original papers were thrown out. I admire your courage and perseverance to get the work clinic to help fight for you, though; that takes guts. 

I would suggest maybe trying to find meal support to resist your urges to skip meals and snacks. Maybe get a trusted friend or family member to eat as many meals as possible with you. This can help reduce the excuses and keep you accountable. You'll be able to see what others do for portion sizes which is good too.

If you believe you are in immediate physical danger from low heart rate and whatnot, you may want to consider stopping by an emergency room or urgent care. Obviously that's not as ideal as an Ed clinic, but you don't want to die either. 

I'm glad to hear you stopped exercise as that's a hard but important one. I wish you luck and feel free to PM me if you ever need to chat. I can serve as internet meal support for the time being.  </TEXT>
