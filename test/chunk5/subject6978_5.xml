	<TEXT> We were going out almost every single day as friends for a few weeks. One day we were sitting at a cute cozy coffee house, having awesome conversation and just a great time overall. At one point he looked at me, smiled, and just took my hands from across the table, held them and caressed me a little bit. It definitely started a spark in me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are on a LDR with 10 hour time difference, which obviously makes it hard to speak. However I know sometimes he could make a few minutes to speak and he doesn't. It has only happened the last few days but it's annoying. There are very few hours during the day when we are both awake, and I really love hearing him in the morning, always makes for a much better day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today I took my last accutane pill. I did 40mg for six months. Extremely successful, I've been clear since a month and a half in, and the side effects were really not bad. 
I want to hear from people who finished accutane, how long did it take for the dryness on your lips to go away?
I also have a question about skin and hair. Since taking accutane my skin and hair went from extremely horribly oily to normal. Did this go back to the original oiliness for you? Stay normal? Somewhere in between?
Thanks everybody </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was cheated on as well, and I understand where you're coming from. What helped me was basically being honest with my current SO. He knows what happened, and therefore understands my fears. I assume that if right now you're still with your current SO, you do trust her. Now, its not going to be easy, but you will have to somewhat out yourself in her hands. If you ever feel these kind of feelings coming, you should talk about it with her. She needs to understand, and if she doesn't, maybe she's not for you. Being cheated on can cause quite the trauma, so you need somebody who understands it and will be patient with you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mentioned I liked a certain watch when we were at a mall. When we were back in the car, he suddenly needed to buy something for his sister from a mall close by. While he went and looked for what he needed, I was just window shopping. The. He came by holding a bag and told me to open it. Inside was the watch. I loved the gesture so much, it wasn't even about the watch. The best thing was that he did it just so he could see my face when I opened it. </TEXT>
