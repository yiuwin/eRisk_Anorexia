	<TEXT> My last batch of skateboards I artified. I love having little to no idea what i am going to do. Then just draft outlining, colouring and then going over outlines and touch ups. All mistakes are fun tests and turned into something. I find using the more chaoric part of brain and jamming very theraputic. I still use my graphic design brain for positioning objects, flow, eye directiin tricks etc but embracing the freeform is greatness.... More chaos and art here at my insta.. https://www.instagram.com/dunehaggar
