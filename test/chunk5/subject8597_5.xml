	<TEXT> Kinder Surprise will get you locked up in El USA. 

Also, their production lines have apparently contaminated quite a bit of Ferrero product with an allegedly carcinogenic byproduct.

Shame too, cuz I'm stuck deep in the US, grew up overseas and know Kinder Eggs to be the finest treat in human history.

Though they are banned as a choking hazard, I truly suspect they were banned due to efforts by effectively greasy Cracker Jack lobbyists. The same greasy Cracker Jack lobbyists will undoubtedly downvote this post. 

Watch.

	<TEXT> Downtown. Tall, old building.

I was taking a quick nap after work and woke up wondering if I was back in AIT, with my Battle Buddy jacking off in his bunk below me. 

I wasn't. 

Earthquake didn't Cross my mind until after I looked around the apartment searching for the source of the slight shaking. 

Really mild. 

Got confirmation when I saw this on my front page. 

First earthquake. I've been in, around, and over this state for twenty years. Not a single Tornado.

	<TEXT> Pizza folding. 

It's a tactic deployed to scarf down twice the pizza of the person(S) sharing the pie with you. It's greedy, contemptable, and if these were old enough days, this behaviour would have ended in Mortal duels. 

Rarely does my blood boil so hard as the day I catch some scumbag, jamming slices down their gullet at twice my pace.

I could kill!

	<TEXT> In order of release:

Iron Man
TFA 
Winter Soldier
Guardians Of The Galaxy
Civil War

Close runner up:
Ant Man

Don't get me wrong, I was thrilled too see the Avengers finally assemble, but I didn't give a damn about Loki's motivations, the Chitauri were bland as moms mashed potatoes, and I really hate Ruffalo's Banner and Hulk ("Puny God" bit aside). Cap' didn't get the love he deserved, and his costume was horrible. I walked in fearing the worst, and walked out feeling like I didn't get spanked as hard as I should have for burning down the barn, though I still got spanked. In someone else's hands (Favreu?) Things would have probably clicked better. Not the worst movie I've seen, but far from the quality I got from all of the Steve Rogers flicks. 

I should also note that before MCU, Captain America was one of my least favorite Marvel characters, regardless of his status as one of Marvel's top tier guys.

	<TEXT> Yes. This.
About the only nice touch he put on AOU was the bit with lifting the hammer leading into Visions introduction. 
The first Avengers flick turned out better than I expected, but I still place it in the same league as Thor 2, or lesser of the rest of the lot.
Never been a fan of his directorial crap. Glad to see he's no longer the head cheese of MCUs efforts. </TEXT>
