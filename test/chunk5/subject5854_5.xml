	<TEXT> I think he was doing some Twitch streaming, I'd love to see more video game stuff incorporated into his actual show and I barely play them anymore. He makes it entertaining though. He brushes over it or mentions it here and there, but it'd be refreshing to listen to some longer talks on it instead of current events talk all the time. Could do some weekend specials on his website with some gaming, or during TACS some reviews or watching trailers/talking about the games hes playing lately. 

I think he has more young fans than he might suspect, and gaming in general seems to attract so much traffic on the internet. Throw some of that stuff up on YouTube and it might pull in a new crowd. For his older fans were reaching a point anyways where almost every age group has a decent amount of gaming fans </TEXT>

#edit #2 it's not pulled!

it works for me now I just checked and am listening through it. the question is -- is it edited?!

	<TEXT> Interesting theory since those 2 were definitely feeding Opie with whatever they could to break up the cliqiness of the staff, but how could they 'speak up if they want' since they're not there anymore? Unless Opie is under some delusion that they were listening in and could take to Twitter, but it came off to me at least, like Opie was referring to a person who could get on a mic at the channel at some point </TEXT>

	<TEXT> erock for sure IMO, probably jealous Sam was becoming an on-air personality building a following for himself because compared to being a program director for a bunch of shows that don't need one, Sam was actually building a future at the company. Not to mention Erock had to be there all day long at the office and then come in again on the weekends to do his Eric Nagel show.

This is drama is like Real Housewives of Sirius XM 

BTW.... Sam Roberts response clip incoming! 18 mins left to upload and probably 5-10 of processing. It'll be ready to go here in a bit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkUjt5N8VUA

Opie will be on at 3PM today, it'll be interesting if or how he responds. Just my own shitty opinion but Sam's response compared to Opie's behavior in all this really makes Opie look like a 6 year old. I don't know how anyone could criticize Sam for what he's doing, separating that from whether or not one likes the actual show, Gregg Hughes did this shit to everyone and put everyone in the position they're in... Failed contract antics followed up by socialmedia temper tantrums and then douchey rants on his afternoon bonanza.

	<TEXT> I didn't start going on message boards until 2008/2009 and lurked for awhile before signing up in I think 2010. He always got the lions share of criticism from fans but ever since 2014 it became something totally different. Anthony didn't get too much but used to get a bunch of criticism for politicizing the show especially around presidential elections and for the angry rants about things, moreso the ones that really haven't made it to YouTube or anything cause they weren't as funny or comedy based as the ones that are on there. Jim used to get criticism but I hardly remember what it even was

Believe it or not Patrice used to get criticism. I remember people on Wackbag listening threads hearing he was going to be in and saying fuck that not listening. People used to think he talked too much and took over the whole show when he was on. Pretty much everyone used to get their fair share of criticism.

Also peoples criticism of others used to get more criticism. On WB there wasn't really one overriding opinion on anything, no upvotes or anything like that, you'd see a bunch of differing opinions on everything and you didn't really know what everyone thought of any one opinion unless it got quoted a lot </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today went to Opie but I think today was really just round 1. Jim and Sam had nothing but ambiguous YouTube videos and tweets to respond to this morning. After getting the Anthony call out of the way, they have 2 hours of material to dissect and smash tomorrow if they so choose. If they don't so choose then they lost, but there was plenty of stuff in that temper tantrum I doubt theyll be able to resist addressing.

Not to mention tbh you can't make major O A news every single day, Opie played the joker card his first day in now he has months and months of shows to do ahead of him, IMO it can't be denied that Opie won today, but where will we be next week? December? Next summer? There's a long road ahead </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That call was 2+ years in the making, Opie activated the Doomsday Device today. Just when the he was about to get fully blown away by total nuclear holocaust, he went to war room and had Erock press the big red panic button. It could only be used in the event of a dire emergency right before certain death and it was, he practically had no choice. Opie could've kicked another 3 dogs live on the air in front of their owners, lined up 8 homeless people in the studio and presented them with a golden platter stacked with prime rib from Peter Luger steakhouse before doing the Dougie on the table until their dinners were mush and we'd still be talking about the last hour right now. 

As far as we're concerned that was quite possibly the worst timing imaginable for the call to happen and for Opie it was by far one of the luckiest moments of his career. Had that call not happened, this subreddit would be drenched in war paint right now. </TEXT>

At some point in the next year all around early next summer, the 3 of them go on TACS for an O A reunion episode. Things continue to go well and then next August just when it looks like O A might return at Compound Media... Sirius XM throws together a new contract for all 3 of them to come back to morning drive. Samuel goes back to nights... Keith gets left with Gavin and East Side Dave while Anthony becomes a part time guest on Compound Media and TACS ends its run for the return of O A. Then everyone hates O A within a week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are rappers that set trends and rappers that follow them. For the most part (I'm sure not every piece of his work) I think Logic is one that follows them, but he does it well, and his social media game is solid, which makes sense that he has the fanbase. 

Overall, music is about what sounds good to the ears, and if you can follow trends in a way that sounds really good and you do it in a way where it's not completely blatantly obvious, then there's not really a valid reason to say the person sucks. However at least to me it sort of puts them in a different classification in my mind semi-subconsciously, one that's incomparable to rappers who push their own themes and sounds, the rappers who other rappers pull from to jump on what's hot as opposed to the rappers who change what's hot. 

When rappers are trendsetters they get remembered for that and they usually get set apart from others for being unique and ahead of the game, so given that, I have no real problem with rappers like Logic, I just see them differently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pollak is a smug cunt but a good egg, was a daily listener and fan of the show and probably wouldve fit right in here with his critical thoughts on it

The time he [stepped on Vosshells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSYXVFCOkS0) cause he criticized his speech impediment in a podcast w/ Anthony saying he doesnt have a voice for radio is also great. Vos is so sensitive when the right buttons are pushed 

He does it at about 1 hour 38 minutes on [this](https://soundcloud.com/kevinpollak/anthony-cumia) Vos took that way way too seriously IMO </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good ideas, I guess its a bit early to make this poll too since Norton and Friends / Opie Show really hasn't gotten off their feet yet.

Some of the results are interesting so far though, some split decisions like 3rd mic on J S, the O A reunion, and the numbers on the CPM rankings

Saved your post on a notepad file and if the questions don't seem too outdated by then I'll add them into a new one for the end of 2016 around X-mas break, when there's a better idea of how the new shows are going. If you want to do one now and post in this thread/new thread with more of the speculative questions I'll definitely put my votes on it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks twinks. Jeez what a girl Opie is. That would have made for an epic air-out of their issues on the air since they get every other staffer to do the same, but instead Opie walked out on the show, didn't show up the next day, didn't show up the day after, and finally comes back in on the 13th

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG93sRo86TI

Briefly mentions that him and Anthony had a fight right out of the gate, does the ol Danny got fired bit in the same sentence and then no mention of the fight is made again according to Struffs rundowns and its never mentioned again as far as the next week or 2 of shows goes.

The 2nd biggest one being Sam's channel is icing on the cake... Homeless Mustard was when Opie tasted that viral glory, I remember that all going down and Opie was riding that high for awhile before X-mas break talking about it on the show, but it was right before monetization which was implemented the following year around 2011. I doubt he was part of the paid partnership before that but don't know for sure. He's probably been chasing that Mustard dragon ever since  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Full breakdown of OpieRadio on YouTube and the real reason for all his attempts at going viral </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-01 22:34:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Where do these random non-O A/O J related videos that Opie uploads come from, the old guy fishing for Trump's hat, Trump black guy, Trump Seinfeld, etc? Why is he putting them all up?

 He might make these videos, might buy them from other content creators (explained in this post), might have other people make them for him, but no matter what the origin is of the videos, there is a specific reason he's been doing so many of them. Opie's trying REALLY hard to go viral, and it's not just for his own satisfaction or some innocent interest in videomaking, it's all solely because of the whole racket he's trying to get himself involved in. From the look of his channel over the past few months, he's getting pretty desperate to get those viral numbahs too. By the end of this post you'll have learned all there is to know about Opie's content, what too much stimulants in one day does to a person, and how little of anything productive or important I've done this weekend.

[Detailed statistics for OpieRadio on YouTube](http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/opieradio) (See - "Network Claimed by"). The network on here is called Base79, but this isn't fully up to date.

Base79's Twitter https://twitter.com/BaseSeventyNine

The Twitter bio redirects to a company that acquired Base79, a now-defunct company called "Rightster" which was doing badly on the London Stock Exchange, and was [taken over by a new CEO, restructured, and renamed "Brave Bison"](http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/AN_1460539399782706000/bullish-rightster-to-become-brave-bison-restructuring-costs-widen-loss.aspx)


Here a little more evidence/confirmation to see that they own and/or associate themselves with his footage -- 

1. [This video was reuploaded from Opie's channel by someone else in 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOp5RVh22uo). You can see on the bottom of the video description that Base79 owns the copyright: "*Suggested by Base79 Ent 2 (Base79/20)*"

2. [Opie's video in a playlist on Brave Bison's official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvqUT1vzf53aNpUrMvSD9d_0uVEBztYA7)

Brave Bison -- http://bravebison.io/

From their About page:

The Online Video Business started out looking to commercialise content through audience maximisation.

To maintain competitive advantage in a world that always catches up, an Online Video Business in 2016 commercialises content by succeeding across the full spectrum of content - from managing existing to conceiving and producing fresh, exciting, original content.

Brave Bison is the Online Video business redefined.

It is the art and science of content making and management.

It is creative, collaborative, data-informed, inspired and inspiring.

It is remarkable and unstoppable.

(The company [is not reviewed very well by its employees](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Brave-Bison-Reviews-E639384.htm))

On this network, there are over 2,000 content creators who make videos and who's content Brave Bison has some type of contractual property of. The details of that are unclear on how many videos they own or how it specifically works. This network is not just a list of clients, it's a collaborative group of content creators and an additional way to **profit from or acquire content licenses.**

Here is the site that Brave Bison runs which does just that: http://videospring.bravebison.io/ 

On this website there are videos that all of Brave Bison's clients, including Opie can upload to. This is the place where marketers, companies, or even other content creators can acquire licenses to use these videos on their own websites, channels, advertisements, etc.

Some examples of Opie's videos on this site:

* http://videospring.bravebison.io/chrysler-building-insanity-opieradio/

* http://videospring.bravebison.io/gary-buseys-crazy-brain-animated-by-cokelogic-opieradio/

This one is sketchy... Opie trying to sell licenses on Cokelogic's animations! Not sure about the backstory on that. Hopefully Cokelogic knows about this...

* http://videospring.bravebison.io/harlem-shake-that-ass-opieradio/

* http://videospring.bravebison.io/most-disturbing-twerking-ever-opieradio/

* http://videospring.bravebison.io/william-bill-shatner-has-had-it-opieradio/

This is the specific reason he's been trying so hard to get any of his videos to go viral.  Regarding those heavily edited Trump videos and other off-topic viral-ish YouTube videos he puts up (How to remove egg yolks...) -- this type of network could be exactly where Opie buys these various videos to use for himself, has them made by someone he knows outside of radio/someone on the staff, even he himself might make those Share-on-Facebook type of videos for his channel... might just buy licenses for them from other creators online through sites like this, but despite where they come from, all of this effort is not just for internet glory, ego, or bragging rights, he's trying to make a hustle out of these random attempts at going viral, like he's going to hit it big and be able to sell or lease licenses to companies on his videos for a good deal of money.

Now we know why Opie really gets so pissed off when his videos are ripped on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram and go somewhat viral.  Besides not getting his own ego-stroking satisfaction of the credit for it, the whole entire effort he's putting into doing this stuff is *completely defeated* when someone just takes the content and uses it on their social media pages where it gets a bunch of shares/views. They get the full benefit and use out of his stuff without going through this whole scheme of buying a license it from him through Brave Bison. All that effort and legwork -- totally wasted.

Imagine this is what Opie's wife, few remaining friends, and SXM underlings have to listen to all the time from Opie. Opie's big viral aspirations, explaining the company he's all wrapped up in repeatedly, on dinner dates with other couples, family gatherings while his wife sits by his side suffering through the same mushmouth presentation she's likely heard almost 100 times over by now, long car rides where he brainstorms about new content ideas, Sam and Erock having to hear about it for years on end at the studio before and after shows, it has to be absolutely exhausting for everyone around him. 

The worst part is they all must know that despite his efforts, it's been **6 long years of this**.... and it's never happened once

	<TEXT> You can use any email and the trick works where you put a dot in your email to get free trials like email@gmail.com then the next month e.mail@gmail.com then em.ail@gmail.com etc etc... my problem with gmail registrations (might just be me though) is that they sometimes take up to a day or more to get to my inbox. I just make emails at https://outlook.com with random phone numbers one time a month and it goes to that inbox instantly. Takes like 30 seconds to make a new email. You don't have to give your real phone number on the outlook or the Sirius XM registration, theres no text message verification or anything like that

BTW when you get it signed up make sure to go into options on the web player and set it for maximum quality on the audio settings. Especially if you want to browse around the music, the "Normal" quality is total garbage. Even "Maximum" isn't great but it's definitely better than the regular.

Also if you hit "Turn Off All Notifications" I think it disables the 90 minute "Are you still listening?" prompt. I did that setting and left it on for a few hours and came back home and it was still playing so it seems like it works for it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, at best it's a complete disaster in the making that will deliver day after day at some point in the future, at worst it's something in the bank for a  new point of interest after Norton and Friends mellows out on the drama and becomes a regular old daily show. Although either way I don't think we will have to sabotage it for it not to happen.. I can't even picture it really happening in reality. I think Opie's only embracing it as a last attempt to drum up some type of leverage for his negotiaton </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't hoped for segments where there are no other guests in awhile but all week I've been waiting for those, when it's just Sam and Jim with Travis it's been my favorite parts of the shows. I do hope they put the MMA stuff on a limit, I get that they like it but as someone who just watches it when there's a high profile fight I don't care for the fighter interviews much at all. The more they do the show together the better it will get probably, since theyre still not used to doing regular shows together. I'm looking forward to when the comedians stop back in too, it'd be funny if we start seeing Louis CK Vos and Colin come in way more often, confirming why they slowed down or stopped in the first place </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have an amazingly good memory this was awesome. There was some of the most entertaining stuff from December 2015 on too, leading up to 2016. All starting with the Esther Ku O J meltdown and then it never let up with something new nearly every day. Every host from almost every show in rotation on TACN went right at Opie, Gavin multiple times, #LOSStandsWithOpie, Greggshells II on TACS, and pretty sure Bennington did some subliminal commenting on it and parodied it with Chris on Periscope, leading us right into the Dani incident which might have been my favorite 24 hours on the sub of all time.. BoboOrbani calling the jailhouse and confirming his Uncle Anthony was in for the night, TMZ running the story and it just kept getting better from there. A red-letter year as we watched multiple shows go down in flames for 6 months on one side and 10 on the other. It wouldn't have been even half as entertaining without the subreddit </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Nothing newsworthy but it's about 10-15 minutes in and only lasts a few minutes. Ant said he heard Jim and Sam discuss it today, also heard the Ron Bennington clip, complimented Ron on being able to improv a bit for 10 mins. 

Asked Keith if there'd been any interaction with Opie and Keith brought up the tweets last night that he had with him. Keith said they were sincere and that his whole life snowballed from 1 call in 1999, without Master Po screwing up by [tackling someone on a walkover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkGs4ss7zvQ) and pissing off the company, he never would have started his security company and worked with the show, wouldn't have the other clients he has now and wouldn't be where he was without the O A show and both Opie and Ant embracing him as new security.

Ant asked if Opie's tweet about doing a show at 3PM today meant he was going to pop into TACS studio jokingly and Keith said no, that it was probably about doing one on Sirius. He's technically still employed by them until October but he's done all the shows he was required to by contract. I'm guessing that show didn't happen today

Finally Ant wishes Opie well and said he doesn't have any ill will for anyone, they're all just trying to get by. He also mentioned that he's graduated from Batterer's Intervention classes

Ant is doing InfoWars tomorrow 3-4PM EST and on RedEye Friday night

EDIT: [He also fielded a few calls about Opie predictions, speculated on what he thinks he'll do, and when asked by Keith about doing a show with Opie in the future said 'in this business *nothing* is off the table'](https://vid.me/DJ7a) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a time I defended Opie to an extent, mostly because going way back to the beginning of O A w/ J he kind of set the "mood" that became the vessel through which Jim and Ant were hilarious. After awhile though that whole mood he set became outdated and left in the 90s/early 00's, Jim and Ant outgrew it with their back and forth and didn't really need the foundation anymore because the show had already developed into itself, that's when all the jealousy and insecurity set in and he became more of a detractor from what it developed into rather than someone pushing it forward. Then when he tried to set the mood on O J it was a whole different story and one that no one wanted but he kept trying to turn it into the type of show there are already hundreds of all around the country and internet taking away any uniqueness that O A/J had to differentiate themselves. 

He was like an anchor for a ship that needed it for awhile but when the ship was ready to sail they couldn't get him to pull the anchor up so they just had to row their way through with his anchor dragging on the sea floor </TEXT>

So on a technical you could possibly win too but it could only be confirmed after season 6 which was the the main stipulation of the bet. If it ends up where you were right, IMO they shouldn't have to pay either, since season 6 ended and we don't know who died but we do know someone died. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yeah that Season 6 moment was one of my favorites of the whole show. When Father Gabriel gives that short speech in the church about how their prayers were answered, that was just badass. 

It reminded me of Band of Brothers HBO Series where they are fighting in Foy and they are separated from their other company, and in the middle of battle Lt. Speirs just starts charging across the field, right through the Germans who didn't even fire on him at first because they couldn't believe what they were seeing.. then when he caught up with the other company, he actually ran back through the line of Germans again, and the morale went through the roof at that point

	<TEXT> I thought Season 3 was so cool, it really sucked me into the whole world and without giving anything away, the whole non-zombie world becomes much "bigger" and interesting due to your first exposure to societies within it and more importantly how they interact with each other. I got very enthralled by all of it. 

To be honest though I thought the end to season 3 was really strange, you gotta take Season 3 and Season 4 as a complete package to get the full value from it. Season 1 and 2 really just set things up and if you compare season 1 and 2 to where we are now, it's hard to even put into words how much things change and how the whole world of the show changes in almost every way. Season 4 and 5 were by far my favorite and there are some awesome moments in season 6, so just hang on and I think you won't regret it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The part about the S6 finale that really had me feeling grim while watching was that you knew there weren't going to be any twists or turns or messiah moments. For example, just as things were becoming really hopeless during the Wolves invasion, all of a sudden all of the various storylines intertwined again and all those people who were stranded during the quarry plan gone wrong showed up at just the right moment to make the save.

Same thing with how Terminus went, just as you thought it was totally hopeless, Carol shows up with a brilliant save.

This time you knew that all of the various storylines had intertwined and crossed again in all the wrong ways. Each group that was seperate from each other all showed up at once in the ring of Saviors and there were so many Saviors that you knew there couldn't be a hero that would even be capable of stopping it. Carol was severely wounded, Hilltop had no stopping power, Morgan was off with Carol, and the rest of Alexandria was miles away.

It was totally hopeless and you just had to sit through it knowing that. I guess we were due for that to happen though.... law of averages </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bet it was an exec decision, reading about that lawsuit with the original director(?) and how the show has suffered a lot of executive oversight since he got canned, maybe the execs thought that since they were so deep into the series now the initial hype of the show will wane down and this could be something that revamps it, give it a big (but very cliche) cliffhanger that latches on anyone who stumbles into it on Netflix to get them back for the ratings numbers in season 7. If they had done it the other way it would be great for the fans who are already dedicated to watching it, but it's an easy way to make casual viewers more curious so they turn on their TVs Oct. 23rd as opposed to forgetting about it and waiting for S7 to show up on Netflix to get back into it </TEXT>

Although yeah not to mention the 2 songs he linked today could possibly be a bit of a vague reference at the show ending and the one about being the 3rd mic "Yeah about that..." combined with it all does seem very fishy... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He doesn't explicitly say he found out after the album came out, he explicitly says he found out end of sentence. I'd concede to you neither of us know for a fact when he actually found out but your story about finding out after the album came out wouldn't really match up with Drake not tweeting about the album would it? I mean if Drake had no idea about anything and Meek didn't know, why wouldn't Drake tweet it? Meek also seemed upset about his album not getting promoted he also came at Wale for not tweeting the album. It would make just as much sense if he had known the verse was ghostwritten and waited until he didn't get his Drake promotion to accuse him of the ghostwriting thing as it would that he found out after the album came out and then tweeted about it, it seems the former would make much more sense chronologically though. </TEXT>

"I was doing my album, and I asked the n---a to give me a verse for my album," Meek explained to the audience.

"The n----a gave me a verse for my album but he gave me a verse that he didn't write -- that another n----a wrote. Where I come from, I represent the motherf--king game. I represent the motherf--king streets. If you ain't with me, you ain't gotta act like you with me, I got the motherf--king streets with me for life!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Take B2B out of that and replace it with Ether or with Gucci Mane's The Truth. People rarely bring up this track when talking about best diss tracks but this solidified Gucci as the Michael Myers of hip-hop... Jeezy claims he wasn't paid for his part in Icy, later called Gucci Mane retarded in an interview with Big Boy, "allegedly" gave his crew a $10k bounty for Gucci, Gucci shows up at Jeezy's birthday party while feuding with both Jeezy and TI, both being in attendance,  has nothing happen to him.... Gucci then shoots and kills a member of  Jeezy's crew during an attempted robbery on him, beats the case, then makes a diss track touching Jeezy's soft spots.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ycXuQjwag4

..... IIRC this track was never responded back to either except for Jeezy in an interview claiming he'd never send his crew on a "dummy mission"

	<TEXT> Nothing coming out of anyone's mouth has any merit as far as we know. Neither Game, Meek, or Sean Kingston. Especially if Kingston is Meek's day 1 friend, he could easily get on here and say something that Meek or Meeks people asked/told him to say. Kingston isn't exactly the hardest dude around so once his name starts getting brought up if he had any pressure behind the scenes to say something its not hard to believe he would do it. Pretty much the entire thing right now is hearsay  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They simply don't like discussion of any type to take place on the main forum they want it all in the discussion thread. I'm willing to bet its because once the doors are open for discussion threads to be posted, there will be a dozen or so good ones per day mixed within an ocean of shitposting, and then they're going to get a bunch of complaints about why someone's discussion thread was removed and not another one. 

The mods could start a whole message board called "talkhiphop" or "hiphopdiscussion" or something and then endorse it here as a sister subreddit but then they have to mod both so I doubt that happens either </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't to you but you're not everyone. Also like who? They might have a song where it's one way and then another where it's not like that. Not to mention the music videos

Hip-hop doesn't generally respect the woman, 22-37% of all hip-hop songs came up with misogynistic lyrics according to a study that showed up in [this Wikipedia article dedicated to misogyny in hip-hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny_in_hip_hop_culture) ... Meanwhile that doesn't mean the rest of that 78-63% is about respecting females either, it could be talking about flashing jewelry, cars, smoking weed/doing drugs, gang life, etc. I guess they didn't give a % on how much of hip-hop is about female empowerment or uplifting of women or even just speaking about them in a respectful non-objectified manner. From listening to it for about 17 years at this point I would be willing to bet it's not a very high percentage at all.

It's been written about plenty of times

Without defending it on any level, I don't see how this should come as any surprise to anyone that a woman isn't being respected in this scenario, nor would there be any reason to cherry pick this specific case out of the barrage of misogynistic content that gets posted here, played on the radio, viewed on YouTube, or streamed over any software on a daily basis in hip-hop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are so many extremes in this conversation when it's probably in between. Chance is slowly attaining mainstream notoriety and he's not just only known by hip hop or indieheads anymore his name is really getting out there. My sister and her friends on Facebook post about him on a weekly basis and she doesn't follow any music like that so his name must be getting out somehow. At the same time, he is nowhere near even close to Kanye or Beyonce levels of fame. </TEXT>
