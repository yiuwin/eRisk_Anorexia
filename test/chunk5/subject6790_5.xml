Full stop here.  BLM treated everyone in the parade as their own pawns.
They acted like petulant children.

You know what you do with children that scream and yell until they get their own way?

She was fine but for all of us standing in the hot sun I swore never again if these idiots were allowed to participate.

"They also set off smoke bombs and repeatedly yelled via a megaphone "We are under attack!", with citizens, including children and people with mental illness and the Prime Minister behind them."

The fact our Police force didn't swoop in and arrest them right then and there shows how utterly professional they are.  It made me upset but it made me proud that we can stand above it all.

	<TEXT> I blame the unions and many bad decisions by council's past for not funding it properly and being too timid of the wolves on staff.  There is the cost of living, and the fact that so many of the drivers get treated like utter and complete crap by both the riders and the council members who think they are beneath them.
They are being paid a fair wage.  It's the fact that the union has allowed certain bad eggs to stay on, and the refusal to join the 21st century (the RT can run without a driver, but the Union insists there has to be...) for example..
There isn't an easy answer honestly.

Though, could you do their job for minimum wage and not want to lash out / hide when a rider threatens to cut you for not paying a fare? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will ask it again.  What are we paying over a billion dollars for then?

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-police-budget-passes-1.3316592

"For the first time in its history, Toronto Police Services has a $1-billion budget.

The Toronto Police Services Board voted unanimously on Thursday to approve Chief Mark Saunders's request for an increase of 2.76 per cent, or $27-million, to the 2016 Toronto Police Services budget, putting it above $1-billion for the first time.

"Police spending is out of control," John Sewell of the Toronto Police Accountability Coalition told CBC News. "It's a crazy way to spend money," the former mayor of Toronto said."

You can't tell me that we're getting ANY kind of value for our money. We aren't.
