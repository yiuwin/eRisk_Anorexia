	<TEXT> I based it off of a magic item in the DM guide called the Cloak of Displacement. It's *rare*, and it gives disadvantage to all attack rolls, period, although the property was lost for the round if the character took damage. All I did was make it more situational and throw in the casting ability to balance it back out.

At any rate the item turned out to be fool's gold because it was a one-shot campaign and most of the enemies used their teeth or claws to attack. He got more mileage out of the casting than anything else :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cloak of Wax: While worn, this cloak produces a bubble that appears to distort the magnetic field around it, causing any creature attacking its wearer to have disadvantage on attack rolls when wielding a weapon made of metal.

In addition, this cloak has 10 magic charges. The wearer may use two charges to cast the spell Calm Emotions, or three charges to cast the spell Fear. These spells require a material component: a pinch of either brass (for Calm) or zinc (for Fear) shavings, which are consumed in the casting. The cloak replenishes its spent charges at dawn each day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry sorry, the uploading process was taking forever and I went to bed without realizing it actually took D:

First, the flavor: the image shown is a stained glass window inside a chapel, and it's been infested with a peculiar kind of sprite that has melded with the glass. The itinerant priest knows the proper exorcism ritual to get rid of the sprites, but they all have to be outside of the glass for it to work. The only way to get the sprites to de-meld and appear on top of the window is to tap on it in a specific way to agitate them. Get all eight out on the pane to solve the puzzle.

The setup: Print out or copy the pattern; your group will want a hard copy. The eight violet circles at the edge of the star are "nodes", and they are the only thing the players need to interact with. Tapping any node will cause a sprite to appear on that node (place a die or something physical to represent it). Once a sprite appears, the player must tap a node directly connected to it by a straight line on the star pattern, and the sprite will travel along that line to the second node and stay put. Once the first sprite has made a move, a second sprite can be spawned on any node (other than the one currently occupied by the first sprite) and must also make one move in a similar manner. Only the newest sprite may move. If any two sprites collide during a move, they all cackle maniacally at you and descend back into the glass, resetting the puzzle. The puzzle progresses in this same pattern (spawn a sprite on an open node, move the sprite to a connected node, repeat) until either all eight sprites are spawned on the glass (obviously the last sprite doesn't have to move) or the players get stuck and need to reset.

The solution is deceptively simple but I told them very little about how the puzzle worked and let them figure it out on their own. It took my party about twenty minutes and they're fairly clever folks. It's kinda hard to explain the rules without actually showing you, but I hope you get the gist of it and find it interesting enough to incorporate into your own campaigns :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whenever I talk about Sucker Punch, I tend to draw a comparison to Starship Troopers. When it first came out a lot of people criticized it for being pro-fascist, but a deeper interpretation showed that it was actually a condemnation of fascism and most of those critics just didn't catch on. The same way, I think a lot of people who considered Sucker Punch to be misogynistic simply took what they could gather from a surface-level reading, when actually it was the most critical of men's treatment of women.

As you'll recall, the entire premise of the fight scenes in the movie is that they're a metaphor for the main character's dancing (essentially a striptease) and lulling the men in charge into a stupor while the other girls can steal the items they need to plot their escape. With the exception of the bus driver, every male character in the movie is an unspeakably horrible monster, the absolute dregs of humanity.

Think about what the movie is saying here to its mostly male audience. If the movie was heavily marketed on the premise of girls doing badass samurai stuff while wearing skimpy outfits, and those scenes are metaphors for the gross male characters being distracted, then your (meaning the presumably male audience member) equivalent in the movie is... yep, that's the gag. The movie basically lured in a bunch of guys who wanted to oggle the girls in their little outfits, just so it could mock them to their faces: "Hey, you. See that fat guy with the cigar getting robbed right under his own nose? That's you, that's what we think of you."

It also drove a very emphatic comparison to those fight scenes and the fact that the real-life version of the girls (it isn't exactly spelled out because it had to make do with a PG-13 rating, one of the movies biggest flaws) were probably being abused. So yeah, what many critics saw as pandering male fan-service was actually a strong condemnation of pandering male fan-service. The movie really wasn't that great and it may have been too subtle for its own good, but I honestly think that the movie's intention was opposite of how it was perceived, and that's fascinating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Imperius ended up being something of a reluctant ally in Act V. I like to think he had a sort of heel-turn after the Nephalem killed Diablo. Considering that his character defends Heaven from any foe, it makes sense that he'd be skeptical of the Nephalem until they proved themselves, as humanity can choose to fight for either side. Of course he was still kind of a dick ("Do I have to do everything?"), but fighting on the same team gave it more of an endearing antihero vibe. Looking back in hindsight I actually kinda like the character. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's funny; in an earlier draft I can conceived that the castle was generating a powerful magnetic pulse that pulled any compass toward it, so for all intents and purposes the castle *is* the North Pole, which the Walkers considered a great heresy xD After thinking about it, I'm happy with the library section not really being a mini-game if it can just be a world-building lesson with a reward at the end. The spell scroll will be a single cast of the spell *wish* to give a Christmas miracle right at the darkest moment, so the final boss can be as tough as I want him to be :) You've given me some really fun ideas; High Lord Nakatomi is actually a Walker in disguise, trying to end the banishment by retrieving the Thrumming Stone and thus luring the frozen hordes into a second apocalypse. Defeating Nakatomi in his final form (a frost giant) will be necessary to retrieve the Stone and restore the banishment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol I just came up with that on my lunch break. I'm not totally satisfied with it just yet, it needs refinement. I'm thinking of breaking it into four parts, with the first one just being Common and giving them just enough information to want to pursue the story further. Any story ideas on how to tighten it up and make it sound like a truly mythic tale? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd be happy to take suggestions :) I already have a very rough draft mythology that I'll spell out in the tomes. So, the Three Worthy Sages were considered the wisest among their peoples; elves, dwarves, and [as yet undetermined third race with its own language, possibly gnomes or dragonborn]. At the time, an inconsolable army of wintry soldiers were streaming in from the north pole: the White Walkers (my friends are GoT fans; they're also the main cannon-fodder during combat). In the darkest hour, the Sages banded together and with a combination of Elven magic, Dwarven craftsmanship, and Gnomish tinkering, fashioned a powerful device of attraction called the Thrumming Stone, and launched it northward in the talons of an arctic tern. The Thrumming Stone constantly beckons the Walkers to it, and when it was dropped as far north as the bird dared to fly, the Walkers banished themselves to the frozen wastes in search of it. The Sages were canonized heroes for their genius and a new holiday was made to commemorate the occasion, which they celebrate to this day. However, the Sages warned that should the Stone ever be removed from the north pole, the Walkers will return to snuff the candle of life and cast it into darkness.

Of course, the party will realize that that's pretty much exactly what went down at Nakatomi Castle, and why it's being attacked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh dang, that could actually make for a nice little exposition mechanic. I was just gonna have High Lord Nakatomi braindump his backstory on the characters all at once, but the library mini game could do that more organically and provide worldbuilding at the same time :D I have no idea how I'd go about designing such a word puzzle like that on my own, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the whole thing takes place inside Nakatomi Castle (nyuk nyuk Die Hard reference), and the mini-games each take place in a different part of the castle. The whole campaign is not even close to taking itself seriously. There are five main fights for the party (five 6th level characters); an opening fight at midnight, three evil spirits (Xmas themed bosses), and the main boss Jack Frost Giant at the end. There's an hour in between each fight, so to pass the time they have sidequests in different rooms of the castle. Each has its own unique reward, and I wanted the fifth one to be a high level spell scroll from the library. The other sidequests run the gamut of various skills like Stealth, Sleight of Hand, Investigation, etc. I wanted the fifth one to reward skills like History or Arcana or some other INT check, as well as other languages. Maybe it's flavored as poring over old tomes trying to ascertain the wisdom of the ancients and the true meaning of Christmas? Much like any good TV holiday special, cheesy hilarity is kinda the only way to go, so I'm just having fun with it :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm constructing a one-shot holiday themed campaign for my friends, with the format being to intersperse the combat with a few non-combat related challenges in different sections of the castle. These tasks include a riddle, a puzzle, a stealth section, and a gambling mini-game. What I'm missing is one final game, that takes place inside a library. Ideally it would be some sort of scholarly task utilizing multiple languages and a few INT checks (for the benefit of my friend's wizard character), but I'm not picky. Just looking for suggestions, thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I volunteered to throw together a holiday-themed single session campaign for my group, thinking it'd be a good way to learn how to DM if I wanted to try it for a larger story. The format for this game is a few combat sessions interspersed between chances to walk around the town doing various tasks requiring a variety of skills (a sneaky section in the armory, a gambling minigame at the tavern, a simple meta-game puzzle in the chapel) and I wanted some sort of task taking place in a library to round out that stable of tasks. I already know one of my PCs wants to play a Linguist and I'm already leery about how to incorporate extra languages since I only speak the one :P Basically, I'm looking for some sort of clever library side-quest that utilizes a variety of languages, as well as Investigation and other INT checks, without any meta-gaming (by which I mean, for example, literally having the player transcribe something written in Dwarvish script; anyone with a PHB can do that). 

something something word puzzles something something secret codes? I'm open to any ideas, really. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well like I said, language is a fluid thing designed to evolve and change with usage. From my school of thought there's no such thing as "proper" grammar or spelling, only varying levels of pretentiousness. It's just this one particular case that is the metaphorical tiny shard of glass lodged in my urinary tract, and the infuriating thing is I know the dictionary people have a strong case. If I'm being honest with myself and my opinions about the English language, "literally" does now have a de facto definition of "figuratively" and I hate it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So my group has just gotten together again for a new 5e campaign but since everybody has different holiday plans we have to put it on hold. I thought maybe a holiday themed one-off session would be a fun way to tide a few of us over until the main game can resume. The group likes the games fast and combat-heavy, but this is definitely not taking itself seriously. We did one for Halloween with the final boss being David S. Pumpkins (any questions?), and it was a riot! Of course they don't have Christmas in the Forgotten Realms per se, but what are some fun goofy ideas I could throw in to capture the spirit of the season? Maybe rescuing Santa from kobolds? A re-hash of the Star Wars Christmas Special where they have to fight Art Carney and Bea Arthur? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know you didn't say this as a bad thing but I wanted to say something about it. People always give Avatar's story shit for being derivative and that has never worked for me as a point against it. Nobody calls out The Raid for being basically Pencak Silat Die Hard, because the story wasn't as important as the kickass fight scenes and solid pacing. Megaman and Mario games always have literally the exact same story because giving the fewest possible fucks to the plot elements allows the developers to focus on the things that make those games really awesome. James Cameron didn't bother with the story because he cared more about basically inventing an entire world, showing off the cool tech, and being entertaining as fuck throughout. Its appeal may have only been fleeting but I know for sure I was never bored, and for a 3 hour movie that's a pretty big deal. </TEXT>

Anyways my bogan friend, as much as I'd love to discuss the merit of your WW2 argument and point out that two-thirds of people sent to fight in Europe were drafted, not volunteers, I'd prefer to end it on a positive note. The statistics for violent crime, cancer fatalities, and global extreme poverty are all at the lowest they've been in recorded history. Which is good news no matter how you slice it, but the crime rate didn't go down because of Charles Bronson or Robocop retaking the streets. It was a very complicated amalgamation of many factors that seem insignificant on their own but really add up. Improved investigation techniques, a war on drugs that had its faults but still reduced the number of people addicted to crack, even the rise of home entertainment causing people to stay home instead of the streets all contributed in a small way. Cancer was reduced because of better detection and treatment methods, none of which were advertised as the "cure for cancer".

Think about it, friend. If people really were as greedy and petty as you think, we'd have wiped ourselves out when we were still living in grass huts, not evolved to build fucking awesome space stations. You're communicating with me from across the world near-instantly through a device that represents decades of computing power evolution, all thanks to a bunch of people who decided the shittiness in the world wasn't enough to stop them doing what they can to make it better. </TEXT>

I'm not a huge fan but I went back and watched Clerks a while ago and had to admit it was a little dated and his directorial inexperience really showed but... god damn, there really wasn't anything like it at the time. You didn't just have your slacker main characters talk about Star Wars and nerd ephemera, and I think a lot of Gen X latched onto that idea that ordinary lives could be movie-worthy. It's rare to find a fairly major Hollywood director who's so in tune with the fans who put him there in the first place, and I think he's genuinely sincere about rewarding their loyalty. On the other hand, it could just be a reaction to his mainstream failures by retreating to a comfort zone where he knows he's liked, but there's truth to both sides I think. </TEXT>
