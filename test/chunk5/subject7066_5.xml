	<TEXT> I know for sure that I got to keep my stuff, and looking over a guide, it states the same thing. You can go for the trial again for 10 rupees if you still have all 3 items or 20 if you don't. Maybe we're talking about different shrine quests here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Climb and  climb some more. Spot a tower or a shrine? Mark it on your map. That's what my first hours of gameplay were. Got every tower first while getting shrines along the way. Definitely nice to have the entire map unlocked so early.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Center of a mound almost in front of buddy, lined up with the groove in the snow. Can't really explain it that well but there are plenty of videos that show how yo get lots of strikes. I made 10k in an hour while half assed paying attention. If you went steady at it for an hour, you'd prob end up with twice that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I've beaten the whole main story but I didn't pay attention/didn't have sound loud enough or skipped all cutscenes I could. Didn't feel like paying attention to the story this time around. 

I didn't even get the alternate ending. I had all memories before I fought ganon the first time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I own everything he has for sale and I didn't even try. I just played like usual and when I noticed him, I'd go and trade. Didn't take too long like that. But if you wanna get it all quick, I'd search up farming dragon parts or hinox and lynel. Not sure how much mon the latter are worth bit pretty sure dragon parts go for upto 250 each.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually don't have any least favorite thing. 
Never watched the cut scenes. 
Love the durability of items. I come across so many it doesn't even matter. 
Love cooking and making elixirs. 
Rainstorms make it more interesting. I want to sleep through them, but its nice having to find another way other than climbing. 

Honestly can't think of one thing I dislike in the least about this game. I'm just having so much fun running around and enjoying the experience as no other LoZ has been able to give me.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Irregular Blood Moons </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I've read a lot about people have irregular blood moon occurrences. I've never experienced one even though I've left my system on for days (Wii U). I was wondering if I just experience one. It was about 9:00 am and I selected to sleep until morning. During that very brief blackness of sleep, I had a blood moon. 
I've never had one when I was sleeping before.
Has this occurred to anyone else? Is it normal? </TEXT>
