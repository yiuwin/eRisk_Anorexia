	<TEXT> It's going to cost a lot of money but from what it seams my school district has a lot of money and they just built s new 15 million dollars school. The money that they are going to spend is dumb it could be spent else where as there hasn't been any trans person in the school but me for many many years. They could have just said thy trans people could use the bathroom they identify with and it would have been a lot cheeper.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I am a senior in high school but I take classes at the university instead but I am still in high school. so I only just heard it now but my high  school went 100% gender neutral as of yesterday. They sent an email out to teachers saying that boys and girls can use what ever bathroom they want to. This was not something I was expecting at all as I am the only trans person to come out since at least 2009 while still in highschool. But after I came out it got a lot of people talking about it from what I been told witch probley help the decision a lot. </TEXT>
