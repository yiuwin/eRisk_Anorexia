	<TITLE> Christian kittens. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-20 18:25:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A preacher was taking a walk one day and happened upon a young girl who was playing with something in a cardboard box. 

When he got closer he could see that the box held a litter of new-born kittens.  "What kind of kittens are those?" asked the preacher.  "They're Christian kittens," replied the little girl.

The preacher walked on, pleased to see that the little girl had Jesus foremost in her thoughts. 
A few days later the preacher saw the little girl again.

"And how are your little Christian kittens doing today?" he asked.
 
"Oh, they aren't Christian kittens, they're atheist kittens," replied the girl. 

"But... I thought you said they were Christian kittens?" responded the preacher, concerned over the sudden change. 

"Oh, they were. But now their eyes are open."

	<TEXT> and there was a middle aged man in there, crouching down, holding a white stick and wearing dark glasses. 

After saying hello to him, there was an awkward silence between us and I was faced with a very awkward situation.

Should I help him? Will he be offended if I try to help him? Should I just let him get on with it? 

Well in the end, I decided to do the right thing. 

I got off at the 3rd floor and let him finish having a shit in peace.
