I assume you're in your teenage years correct? It is human nature to be horny but don't let it control you. Just do your thing and when it is done, do other things. Though I do suggest **not engaging in coitus yet** during teenage years. </TEXT>

LOL! Wag. Age doesn't matter in a professional work. Respect lang between each other. Tell her privately that you don't like those words being used when talking to you professionally. Let her know na ok lang outside the office/workplace and hindi na oras ng trabaho but when it is **time for work, keep everything professional**.

Boss ka nya and paano kung makita ng boss mo or client mo na ginaganyan ka ng tauhan mo sa oras ng trabaho inside the office/workplace. May tamang oras for that. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /r/Philippines was different before elections 2016. I remember finding out this sub around year 2012 and it was all fun in this sub mixed in with minimal to moderate posts about politics here in our country. Then ayun after 2016 elections naging ganito na. I'm also open naman sa mga political discussions pero for me, nawalan na ako ng gana mag browse sa subreddit na ito except for Daily and Nightly Random Discussions na lang.

Can I suggest that can we use Flair system? It is a way for the users to segregate posts and what posts the user likes to see on his/her reddit /r/Philippines page. /r/SmashBros does this system and the post will not publish if the Poster did not assigned a Flair with the help of a Moderator Bot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I just checked it and wow. I've been having a hard time IV breeding a Pokemon in Pokemon X/Y and/or OR/AS though I do have a 6IV Japanese Ditto but still, its hard because it really takes time for the Pokemon I want to have specific IVs.

Like in my case right now. I want a Sylveon with Modest nature, Pixelate Hidden Ability and an IV set of HP, Def, S.Atk, S.Def, Speed in a Heal Ball for Double battles. As of this post I have a Female Eevee with Modest nature, Pixelate Hidden Ability and an IV set of HP, Atk, S. Atk and Speed in a Heal Ball. I don't need Atk IV since Sylveon is a Special Attacker.

Then I learned that there are IVs PoGo. I think I'll just stick to collecting Pokemon in PoGo and stick to battling in Pokemon OR/AS and the incoming Pokemon Sun/Moon. o.0 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The rumors are true. [Final Fantasy XV is delayed. New release date is November 29, 2016 from September 30, 2016.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wepgwx_9kto feature=youtu.be)


In all honesty, I'm fine with this and its been 10+ years since this game was announced. Saving money for both Pokemon Sun/Moon and Final Fantasy XV is a win-win for me and they are 11 days apart. How hard can a less than three months wait for FFXV? 

I admire the transparency and gesture of Tabata-san did for this announcement. Correct me if I'm wrong but Black Friday in the US is before November 30th correct? 

With that said, I think it is a great marketing opportunity for both PS4 and Xbox One. I'm sure the sales of both consoles will soar before FFXV releases.

Also I'm loving the official theme song of FFXV. [Stand by Me. By Florence + The Machine](https://youtu.be/vv2DSmy3Tro) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  stop playing because it is taking a toll on my phones battery life (more charge, means more charge cycles).

This is my initial reason why I was hesitating to play. Its still installed in my Smartphone and I don't open the app. I noticed the battery did improve. I still keep it as a sign of support to Nintendo, Pokemon Co., and Niantic. :)

 I can't wait for Sun and Moon as well. I'll force myself to included Mimikyu in my team. 

I hope Mimikyu will be viable to competitive Pokemon similar to Klefki back in Pokemon X/Y VGC 2014. That Ghost/Fairy typing is scary to go against with. 

 Do you guys think that the revitalized Pokemon Craze will translate to sales for Sun and Moon?

Yeah but I think a portion of PokemonGO players will try purchasing a unit of Nintendo 3DS/2DS for Pokemon Sun/Moon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow. My post about playing Pokemon Omega Ruby on my 2DS got downvoted in last nights, [Nightly Random Discussion](http://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4wpe3h/nightly_random_discussion_aug_08_2016/d68zm00). 

For the record, I have no problem on people playing PokemonGO. I only played it less than 10 to 15 times to understand the hype and I'm happy that everyone is enjoying it. Even though I stopped playing, the app is still in my smartphone to show my support to Nintendo, Pokemon Co., and Niantic. I still prefer playing Pokemon in my Nintendo 2DS because I prefer it that way. To each its own I guess. :)

	<TEXT> Team Instinct!

Since we're talking about Pokemon. Zapdos is the best of the three legendary birds. Its Electric/Flying type makes it immune to Ground Type attacks making it weak to Rock   Ice type attacks. It has a great stats and EV training it to Max Special Attack and Max Speed can sweep a doubles team. You can either choose between Modest Nature that will boost its Special attack or Timid Nature that will boost its Speed. Overall, happy with my Zapdos and having Mega Sceptile as its Partner during doubles battle makes it epic! http://m.imgur.com/nliKWkf

Edit: Spelling

EDIT2: Forgot to mention. Both Articuno (Mystic) and Moltres (Valor) are weak against Electric type attack hence, Zapdos (Instinct) is the best of the three! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're going to buy a N3DS. I recommend buying at Game One in V-Mall Greenhills. They have better after sales service compared to Datablitz. I bought my PS4 there last July 1 and they're great! Also, you can buy a N3DS now around 9.8k if you are paying in cash. It adds up if you're going to pay it in credit card by around 400php to 500php. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fellow drivers! We are now not allowed to use any Smart Device while driving even if its red light. Any handsfree accessories is ok as long as you're not holding your phone. My question is, does the Phone Dock, where you put your smartphone, considered hands free? I use my smartphone for Waze purposes. =/
