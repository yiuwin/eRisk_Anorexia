	<TITLE> I am obsessed with sex, please help </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So my straight best friend told me about his first time about a month ago, and i freaked out so badly. At first i thought i was being jealous with the girl because i was kinda into him, but then i realized i was afraid of never being able to have that kind of intimate relationship with anyone. I envy him so much. As best friend we did everything together, but now it feel like he's becoming a real man, and i am here still confused about my sexuality. I got into a pretty serious depression because of that. Now the only thing matter in my brain is how i am never going to have sex, never being able to be like my best friend, a normal happy man with someone to love.

I do know that i treated sex like an be all end all for relationships, which isn't actually true, but it still hurts like hell. If you have overcome this experience, please give me some advice.

Ps: He doesn't know that i am gay so i can't really talk about this with him

	<TEXT> I am a gay male living in a pretty homophobic country. I got 2 business deal terminated already because people found out about my sexual orientation ( next level bullshit i know ). So i tried to change and hide my outside look by going to the gym, working out ...etc. Everything turned out great, except i noticed that my hand gesture still somehow seems very feminine while talking, typing and even idling. I still haven't come up with a explaination or solution, please help a bro out.

	<TEXT> I want to introduce Steven Universe to my friend, and i know she would love it, but 70+ episodes seem a little daunting. So after watching the amazing "Mr.Greg",  i decided that it would be best to list out for my friend a small list of episodes that resolve around Pearl, Greg, Steven and Rose relationship, hoping she can have a feel for the amazing character development that the series offer. I would be really grateful if you guys can suggest some lists that make sense to new watcher but still can do the series justice.

Is this supposed to be normal ? The +12V rail is at less than 1V while i am playing Graphically  intensive game (Path of Exile, Witcher 3). Lately my PC tend to restart on it own a lot of times without the BSOD, might this be the cause ? Should i examinate the PSU or is there any other culprit ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know they're dynamic and static array, but i have so many other questions.

- Which one would perform better ?

- How're they stored ?

- The static array get deleted if the function in which they're called end, but what if they're called out of the main "method" ? ( global variable )


- How do i allocate new storage size for the dynamic array ?

- The dynamic array has dynamic storage, if i were to expand it would the old data still be there, same when i try to shrink it.

	<TEXT> I thought replacing the PSU would help, but this happen with both my old and new PSU. I tried cleaning it several times already, but to no avail

Using MSI and lowering my core clock help a lot though, lowered my core clock to 830 MHz and Temp is now under 70-75C all the time while playing. But it's killing my fps


 Is there any other culprit i should consider ? I would greatly appreicated if someone could 
suggest a fix.

Edit: My old PSU was 550W, and my new one 600W, GPU usage at 100% while playing games.

Edit2: My games are played at 1360x768 resolution

Edit3: Sorry for the typo on title </TEXT>
