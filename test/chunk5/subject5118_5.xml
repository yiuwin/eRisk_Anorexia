	<TEXT> Directing attention to listening effectively turns down the volume on input to the visual parts of the brain. The evidence we have right now strongly suggests that attention is strictly limited  a zero-sum game. When attention is deployed to one modality (say, talking on a cell phone) it necessarily extracts a cost on another modality (say, the visual task of driving).

Hes talking aboutdivided attention, or the ability to multitask and pay attention to two things at once. Its generally much harder than selective, or focused, attention. The factors that come into play are yourattentional capacityand theprocessing requirements essentially how much of which areas of your brain are needed to process the input.

Your attentional capacity can be taken up by inhibiting (tuning out) distractions, dividing your attention across multiple things, or even sustaining your attention on one thing (vigilance). Fatigue takes a big toll on attention. If youre tired, its harder to concentrate. Depression has a similar effect. In fact, many memory complaints may be actually depression or fatigue-related reduced attentional capacity.

And guess what? Getting older both reduces your attentional capacityandincreases your processing requirements. Basically, it takes more and more inhibition skill to tune out distractions and stay focused.

	<TEXT> Hey everyone could find another post like this, sorry if its a repost. 

I havent done any coke in a while like 4 months, so last night i picked up a half balls of some average coke. Its not bar coke but its a little more potent. So i started doing it at 1pm on friday and my first line was wonderful, felt a little speedy and talkitive, i proceed to do a line every 45 mins to and hour, so around 4pm and like 4 lines later, i get a high that was the total opposite, i become quite, dont really feel like talking to anyone, and i get very tired and lazy, the only thing that makes me feel better is lying on my bed either watching tv or youtube or listening to music. Im also a smoker and i had 2 cigs all day, usually i smoke like a chimeny whileon blow but this time is different. Ive never gotten like this before and it was a very weird/shitty high. I also finsihed the 2 gs around 4 in morning. Could it be the quality or my tolerance is buliding up with each line.any thoughts would be great. Thanks yalll </TEXT>
