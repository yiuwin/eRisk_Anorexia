	<TEXT> I made a silly CoCo deck on Cockatrice a while ago that isn't too far off from this, using [[Skaab Ruinator]] , [[Rhox War Monk]] , [[Woolly Thoctar]] , etc. I had no idea about that [[Pillar of the Paruns]] card, first time seeing it. I'm obviously not the first person to think of it though.  Maybe Spell Queller pushed the deck into some sort of viability.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's definitely a cool set. Certainly flavor-wise one of, if not the greatest ever. So naturally you want it to be good functionally as well, but in a lot of cases it didn't quite get there in Standard, and definitely doesn't get there in other formats.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The original series is the best to me. I think people who have trouble watching it find it "boring". To quantify boring, it's slow, mostly dialogue driven, and cerebral. To me though, the fact that the show takes it's time is what allows it to be intense.
This may be an odd comparison, but take Tarantino movies. If his dialogue doesn't "do it" for you, then you are NOT going to like his movies. Kind of the same with TOS.  
I liken the original series to the Twilight Zone. That is, many of the episodes could be movies. Most of them have something to say, or some question to ask about life. With both shows, the episodes transcend their genre, which to me is something the best sci-fi works accomplish. Because the show is able to do this, that is, because the episodes aren't really about science fiction, lasers, aliens, etc., I could care less about old school special effects and cheesy/goofy moments.  </TEXT>
