No. It will largely help minorities especially blacks and Latinos.  Trump wants to help AMERICANS regardless of what color they are. Anti-Mexico? Well Obama is Anti-Israel. Hilary panders to the minority vote.  She tells the minorities what they want to hear so they vote democrat. Her policies wouldn't really address any concerns they have, but she's a democrat so it's "better for minorities". Trump got more Latino and black votes than Romney did, so stop spewing this bs. </TEXT>

CNN should be holding themselves to a higher standard, but time after time they do shit that makes people not trust them.   Look at the post election discussion. That dude called the Trump victory a "whitelash". Like come on get real. Even if you think that it's not something that needs to be discussed on a platform like post debate coverage on election night.

	<TEXT> Watch this video. Paul Ryan explains the idea behind what they are working on. Very costly treatments like cancer and such will be completely paid for by the government. This takes the costly treatments out of the healthcare "pool" if you will. The remaining people will insure each other. This will drastically bring down the cost for everyone else because we won't be insuring the very expensive treatments.


The video is at the bottom of this article.

	<TEXT> Because we know it's a fad. 90% of the people that are doing this will be motivated for a month. 90% of these people will walk on the elliptical for 10 minutes and go home and eat a cheeseburger because they "worked out today." They will post on their Instagram that they are "getting fit" and to follow them on their "weight loss journey". They buy the gloves, the shoes, the yoga pants/gym shorts and bring it in their new gym bag. They buy a 3 month membership to Planet Fitness because they have free pizza every Thursday and bagels in the morning. It's funny because we know how much work they will have to do to get where they want and they don't REEALLY want to lose weight, but they were pressured by their family or significant other.  It's funny because they don't know what they're doing, don't bother to ask, and don't understand why the pounds aren't coming off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which is exactly my point. Sure it's simple to set up a healthcare system in a country with a tiny population. Wisconsin actually had a good health system at one point.  We tried to set up a national governmental health system and it failed miserably. It's not as easy as "oh well Finland did it I sure am glad I live here".  People are so ignorant. Finland doesn't have a massive social security crisis that needs to be funded. Finland doesn't have a lot of the expenses that the U.S. does. I'm just tired of the "oh well my (insert tiny Scandinavian country here) can do it why can't the U.S.?!

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter whose money it is for the last damn time. Was the money theirs? Idk that's a good story put out by the administration. 

How come the money wasn't given to them earlier? Or later? Why did the plane show up on the Tarmac full of cash and the hostages weren't allowed to leave until it came in? You can try to dance around this all you want, but it looks like a rat and smells like a rat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Until they take more hostages because they know we will pay them. And other countries start taking US hostages to get some money that "we owe them". There's a reason we don't pay ransom for hostages. It encourages the behavior. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you really think Iran would kill US hostages? Seriously think about it for 5 seconds before typing something out that you regret. Iran has been begging for years for us to lift the sanctions on them, we did, then they would kill US hostages? The sanctions would be put back into place, probably even tougher and they would never get any uranium like they've always wanted. It's mind boggling that you think this way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ransom

a sum of money or other payment demanded or paid for the release of a prisoner.

It literally has nothing to do with whose money it is.  They gave us a prisoner for money. That's a ransom.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not agreeing with it but the title takes the quote out of context. 

Edit: From Canadian Federal Role final report:

5.1     The Right to Health Care  Public Perception or Legal Right?

To begin, it is important to distinguish between a legal right to health care and the public perception of the existence of that right.  In Volume Four, the Committee noted the existence of public opinion polls that reveal that Canadians, encouraged by politicians and the media, **believe they have a constitutional right to receive health care even though no such right is explicitly contained in the Charter.[1]  Nor does any other Canadian law specifically confer that right, although government programs exist to provide publicly funded health services.[2]** </TEXT>
