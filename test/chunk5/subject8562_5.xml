	<TEXT> Earlier today one of my earbuds broke off in the iPad, and it took quite a bit of prying to dislodge it. Unfortunately, when I inserted another pair of headphones into it, sound continued to come out of the speakers, as if the earbuds weren't in. I tried rotating and reinserting them to no avail. I know the earbuds work. 

Any help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> maybe certain vegans. I dont like to nitpick but vegans tend to do a lot of research before going to a restaurant, seeing if items have animal products. I live near Minneapolis, maybe that has something to do with it? Lots of heavy foods in the colder months.

And yeah, I've seen plenty of fat vegans. Fewer than omnivores or vegetarians, but they're not some endangered species. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> loathing people because of their diet is a pretty nasty thing to do. As a "veggie," I don't have contempt for paleo followers. I think they have a flawed fundamental way of looking and food and animals as feeling beings but...you can't hate someone for one tiny aspect of their life. 

Also, where are these vegans? I've seen fat, very thin, curvy, young, old, frail, and athletic vegans. They are simply people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The eating disorder tends to come before the veganism, not the other way around. 

Me personally? Low self esteem led to restricting thoughts, restricting behaviors, ways to hide my restriction, etc.

There are plenty of healthy vegans, but if the lifestyle triggers her too much at the moment, she may need to take a break and reevaluate once some recovery has taken place.  </TEXT>
