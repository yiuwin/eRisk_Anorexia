	<TEXT> I've never been allowed a day off (nor have I been able to get off early without a ton of backlash) while I work five days, 50+ hours a week.

Then again, I work in a kitchen, get weekends off, and my chef and sous chefs work much, much more than me. I respect them and their dedication. </TEXT>
