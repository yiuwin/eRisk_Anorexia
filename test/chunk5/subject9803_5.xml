	<TEXT> Long story short, I made a bet during the Lions/Patriots game that if the lions lost, i'd have to wear a Pat's shirt every Sunday for the rest of the season, and of course they lost. I never liked the Patriots, but I've despised them each week more and more everytime i put on that damn shirt. So for the superbowl i'll be begrudgingly wearing a Pats shirt, while cheering for their downfall. I don't really care who wins, i just want the patriots to lose.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well there's a bunch of printmakers getting together in. Month and a half I'd say that's a pretty decent place to start. 

Step 1: go to SGC Sphere in Knoxville 

Step 2: register for open portfolio 

Step 3: say your looking for grad schools/ internships/ residencies/ etc

Step 4: go to things, talk to people, network and shit. 

Step 5: don't get a job? Don't let it discourage you, it's not really like getting a job at a print shop is super easy, most people hire people they know/ have worked with before so unless you find a random shop that hires people without experience your gonna have a hard time. I'm gonna assume you have a BFA, the problem is.... Everyone has a BFA, so it sounds shitty, but that degree means jack shit. It's all about your portfolio, your personality, and who you know. So get out there, meet some people, be willing to take some risks, and network your ass off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its strange, sometimes its a crap shoot, i mean like posting anything to reddit sometimes they go, sometimes they don't, this post could have very easily been lost amongst all the other new posts. I think the worst part is when you post something that you put a lot of work into that you want people to appreciate, and it flops, but then a shitty drawing some some pokemon or Bryan Cranston hits the front page. But again, thats reddit, your flop could be reposted an hour later and hit +3k

She makes wood cuts, but doesn't print them either. I mean the main reason behind making prints (IMO) is to make affordable/ fairly unprecious/ multiples and honestly if you don't care about any of that, don't worry about printing, it's ok.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not that it's invalid, your opinion is perfectly valid: you think that the rendering of the hands is distracting/ you think it deters from the overall piece and if they were done more realistically that they would be less of a hindrance and would improve the piece (Personally I like the hands but that's neither here not there).

	<TEXT> So i'm not exactly sure what OP means, but i'll go on a limb and guess.

Its basically a dry point intaglio. Although traditionally done on copper, I've seen them done on plexiglass, so its not to hard to imagine someone going one step farter and using a plastic milk carton. As long as you have a flat, wipe-able surface that can be scratched up and hold ink, you've got yourself a ghetto-rigged intaglio. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So i'll start with scale, I love big prints If i could i'd make nothing but massive 8 foot intricate prints, My biggest print topped out around 4'x5' and my biggest installation was about 5'x36'. unfortunatly, i'm currently supporting myself via printmaking, and its really hard to make massive prints (as well as installations (like swoon) unless you have some institutional backing) financially viable, trying to find someone who A) will buy a massive print B) pay enough to be able justify the time. I wish i could say fuck it, i'm gonna make nothing but massive prints, and if i make it someone will buy it, but realistically, it doesn't work out so well. BUT....I've been applying to grad schools, and if i get in, i'll definatly be going big again, but until then i'm probaby going to have to stick to around 18x24 or smaller.... lame i know, but i do need to pay bills. 

Yah i agree about sticking with one thing for awhile, its just my problem is i get bored or think what i'm doing is getting boring/ visually to simular. I just really need to stick with one thing and exhaust it. Its kinda what i forced myself to do for one piece of my BFA show, I created a print every day for 180 consecutive days. At first it was fun, then after 2 months it sucked, and i told my teacher i hated it and wanted to stop, but she made me keep trucking and it turned out really well. So i think i just need to keep powering thru my boredom...heres a link if your interested.

	<TEXT> yah totally agree with pushing the contrasts. I always feel like if i leave some space black, it'll just seem to easy/flat, which actually ends up flattening out the image since it loses some one those bold contrasts, i'll try to get better at that.  

that more gestural approach you were talking about reminds me slightly of a print i just saw of Tugboats, where they had a more painterly sky. http://www.tugboatprintshop.com/woodcut_valley.htm would be interesting to try to get some effects like that, or just do an entirely loose print just to see what happens. 

Hand colorings.... don't know if i'd ever do it. Some people like it, some people do it sooooo well and it looks amazing. But personally speaking I feel like if i did it, it would be a bit of a cop out.... but then again, my preconceived notions are probably why i'm stuck in a rut.

Edit: also no background in illustration/graphic design, just printmaking. I try to use Ps/Ai occasionally but I never have any idea what I'm doing/ it takes me forever to accomplish the simplistic of tasks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> unfortunatly, at the moment, anything that requires an etching press or lithopress is outside of my abilities (equipment wise). 

though i would love to get back into some lithography more than intaglio (hate wiping those plates), during undergrad i wanted to focus on one medium so i didn't really give to much time to the other processes, hopefully if i get into grad school this year i'll be able to experiment more with everything.  </TEXT>

Recently ROA a street artist came thru my town and he has a graffiti style somewhat simular to how I carve, I might get some paint and see how that goes.  </TEXT>

So i've been following this print on Instagram, and I've really enjoyed watching it grow. the difference between the more realistically rendered dog and the more stylized vines/ leaves works very well. It feels like it has quite a bit of variety in terms of style, as well as the mark making, but it still feels very unified. 10/10 would wear.

	<TEXT> Not saying I agree with this but......

It's often used to elevate it to an "fine art" thing as well. The art world can be a stupid/ pretentious place. A silk screen can be frowned upon/ seen as less because it's "cheap and low art", something that goes on a shirt, but a serigraph is a high art process (even though it's the exact same thing).  It's dumb but that's the way it is.

	<TEXT> My basic understanding: Those Web fellows basically don't have the money to do it, and keep trying to get people to give them money and everyone keeps saying "you've already fucked this project up enough why would we keep giving you more money, which we will probably never see a return on, so you can continue to mismanage this project?" So they're doing just enough construction/ spending just enough money to buy them time until they can find money, which may or may not ever happen. 

TLDR: no funding, and no one wants to give them any.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I moved here from MI a year ago, not gonna lie I was worried moving to KY thought it'd be a bunch of crazy hill people, turns out Lex is one of the most educated cities in the country, nice and pleasant, and not any hill billies ( I think they're all out to the east but idk)I think the best way to describe lex is a big little city. It has a lot of the events/ attractions of a big city (though obviously not as much as a Chicago) but doesn't have the traffic/ crime/ parking issues of a big city. it has a pretty decent downtown, though it's fairly small, and again doesn't having the same hustle and bustle of a Chicago. Also these people down here love horses, bourbon  and UK basketball, so get ready to hear about those. I think someone else mentioned you should just schedual a couple days come down, check out the city wander around and see if it's a fit.  </TEXT>

After he complied I'd move toward the suspect, gun drawn (it could be a real gun and you have to address the situation as such). After figuring out it was a toy I would tell the boy why it was a bad idea, go to his parents and explain the events that happened and why. But I'm not a trained cop, so what do I know.   </TEXT>

Heyo,

This is Todd Herzberg, aka subject9803, and id like to thank you for your interest in the First Annual /r/printmaking Holiday Card Exchange. So this is a pretty informal thing, but here are the specifics:

-Make 10 cards (this is a printmaker exchange so id ask that they be hand printed cards) that fit into a traditionally sized greeting card envelope ( you can get creative if youd like but they not to go super crazy)

-Package them up and get them ready for shipping, within the package you should include:
	-10 cards 
	-10 envelopes 
	-self addressed return envelope
	-5 dollars (either a 5 dollar bill or a check (preferred) I can send an invoice via email (more work thus less preferred)

-Send them to the address below NO LATER (yes you can ship them before that, and it would be golden if you did) than Friday December 5th (yes this is a hard deadline). If your package is shipped after this date, then i cant guarantee your participation in the exchange. 

	if you still need my address Email me at toddherzberg@gmail.com

-Once they get to me, I will document them, collate them, package them, and ship them out
	-We currently have 10 people signed up. this is what will happen if the numbers change
		-less than 10 people send cards: you will get the entire edition, plus how ever many of your extra cards are left over
		-more than 10 people send card: you will get 10 cards that arent your own. you wont get ever card but youll still get as many as you sent (this is probably obvious but if there are 12 people that send cards in youll still only get 10)

- Ill ship them out NO LATER than December 19 but ill shoot to ship them out by the 12th. 

thats the gist of it. If you have any questions let me know. have fun with it. and happy holidays

Sincerely, 
Todd Herzberg
www.ToddHerzberg.com

Ps. Id appreciate it if you didnt post any photos of the cards your making on reddit. I was planning on releasing an album of all the cards a week after i shipped them ( i figure this will give everyone enough time to get their packages so not to ruin the surprise) if anyone really cares about karma, i can send you the album to post but i figured it would be cool to have them all shown at the same time

	<TEXT> Yah fuck that 100k+ noise, I'm applying to schools at the moment, and the only schools I'll apply to are schools that have full- mostly full tuition assistance. Which brings up a good point, ask about their tuition assistance. A lot of schools will offer quite substantial  funding to grads. Thru being a TAs, shop techs, etc they'll often help cover your cost of tuition and straight cash thru stipends. The smaller the school the more likely they can help you financially. a program with 100 grads will have funding but will be much more competitive, where as a program with 12 will be better suited to help everyone out. 

I just feel like coming out of school with strapped with 100k in loans in the art field (ie your not stepping into a high paying field) is something you have to consider while planning your future.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends what you want out of a program. Do you want to go to a big or smaller program. Do you want to make straight prints or do work more experimentally. Are you willing to pay for a program out of pocket or do you need tuition assistance. There's no "right" grad school, there's just the grad school that's right for you. Go on the ole google and search "top printmaking MFA" there's a US News and world report that lists the top programs. Now don't just say oh #1 is the best I want to go there, look into each program, look into the profs look into the current MFAs and see what they make/ do. IMO your buying into the professor more than anything so make sure you like them, have a program that looks like a good fit? Email them and see if you can arrange a meeting/ talk about their program. Your gonna be stuck with them for 3 years so make sure it feels like a good fit before you commit.  </TEXT>

"its super important to use antislin spray or even Pam to keep that top layer from drying. Our mix has dryer in it so the drying time aint so long and along with that goes the care to make sure air do t hit that can. In my own usage, I both use the spray and reapply the cover skin and retape the can after each use. Happy Printing yall"

	<TEXT> for the lazy:

A death investigation is underway in Lexington after human remains were found Wednesday night in a field.

Lexington Police responded around 7 p.m. to the scene off Citaton Boulevard between Newtown Pike and Georgetown Road near Legacy Trail. Officers said a man passing through the area made the discovery.

According Fayette County Coroner Gary Ginn, the remains consist of a skull with teeth, a forearm, and a hipbone. Some clothing was also found. He said the remains are believed to be those of a man and they have likely been there for at least six to nine months. The remains were separated and scattered.

"This is just going to be a death investigation, simply because we ...there is no way we can see what we need to see in order to try to determine a possible cause of death at this time. So, I can't tell you that it's homicide, suicide, accidental and possibly even natural," Ginn said.

Police say they plan secure the scene until daylight Thursday when investigators will search the area for additional remains and evidence.



TLDR: they found parts of human that had probably been there for 6-9 months. police currently have no idea who it was/ what happened. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly work and shipping won't be a big deal. Collating an edition of 10 cards is super easy. and if anyone really can't afford the 5 dollars for return shipping PM me and we can work it out and why i i think having a shipping hub is a good idea:

-people on the internet often like to say they're going to do something but never actaully do. So if we just send out 10 adresses to 10 people, you MIGHT get 10 cards back, or you MIGHT get 2, even though you sent your 10 out to all 10 people. With me sending out the complete packages, you get what you expect, If you send cards in you WILL get cards back no ifs ands or buts. 
ex: my friend starting this pen pal thing, 5 people said they would be pen pals with her, she wrote to all of them, I am the only one who wrote back, and i want to avoid that. 

-Also people some people don't like giving out their address to random people on a internet forum, with only 1 person with access to their address, it may seem less threatening. 

-but this is the first one, if it doesn't go well/ people want to change things for exchange #2 i'm perfectly fine with that.  </TEXT>

He engraves bones, i believe with a dremel, and i mainly wanted you to see how he colors them. i don't think that he paints his skulls i believe he stains them, which might be something to look into. Blesbok 2 is my favorite of his skulls.

	<TEXT> I think its pretty sweet, but i'm not in love with the bead just stopping on the sides. i kinda wish that you would also bead the inside/ sides/ backs so it seems more like the beads are part of the piece rather than just glued (or i believe you said waxed) on. i think if you modified the skull before you started beading, something like a black paint, or say if the beads ended in a red outline, paint the skull red so it seems more connected. I don't know how it'd work (i've never painted/ beaded skulls before) but i think its worth trying. 

Also i don't know how many of these fellers you have laying around, but i feel like if you just did the horns that could be cool too.  </TEXT>

Basic run down: make 10 holiday cards, ship them to me with a self addressed return envelope/ package and 5 dollars (just to make sure i can cover shipping) and you'll get back 10 different cards. I'm going to be sending out the my shipping info and any other info to the people that have emailed me this friday. so far i only have 5 people that have emailed me so if you want in, email me at Toddherzberg@gmail.com. 


more info can be found on the previous post
