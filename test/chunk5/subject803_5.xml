	<TEXT> Anime fans constantly argue over waifu/husbando superiority, so I wanted to ask a question and bury the hachet.

An anime character of your choosing comes to the real world and marries you.

Who would you choose?

Remember, nothing about them will change....other than the fact that they are real now.

**Edit:** *Please write the name of the character, the reason why you chose them and the name of the show.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was happy with batman killing? Hell no.

Cool, we agree on something.

So character development arc wise it is interesting to see where they are going from here.

I think his character arc in BvS could've worked perfectly well if he was just brutal (damages and maims but never kills). 

Superman saving Batman from the edge is a far more compelling story than saving a man who has already fallen.

What has fallen can never come back.

Batman is now a murderer, no amount of "saving" will change that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Clark didn't physically assault him which I think would have been much worse.

A few other people have also said this, but wouldn't trashing his truck essentially trap him at the bar.

Meaning the asshole would continue to harass the waitress?

Clark trashed the truck but didn't do anything to prevent her from getting the same treatment again.

Which is why I would've loved it if Clark dragged him out and talked to him in a calm yet intimidating manner that made the guy apologise to the waitress.

Trashing the truck doesn't only hurt the asshole, but the company he works for, his family, the other company/s who have their stock inside the truck (the bar is a stopover).

It wasn't a well thought decision.

It could have even exposed his identity.

	<TEXT> You literally quoted Batman saying "You can't justify killing" in the most brutal Elseworld story.......and yet you try to justify Batman's murders in BvS.

Quite ironic, don't you think?

Comparing Batman and Cap is as futile as comparing Wonder Woman and Batman.

They both have their own morals and modus operandi.

Batman's actions in BvS go against everything he stands for, while Cap stays true to his beliefs.

- Cap kills Hydra/Nazis in TFA

- Cap kills Hydra in Winter Soldier.

- Cap kills Crossbones (Hydra) and his soldiers in Civil War. He also kills/maims multiple soldiers who wanted to capture Winter Soldier.

He's a consistent character that hasn't changed in both the comics and the movies. </TEXT>

I seriously don't know how you can still make that argument.

Captain America and Batman are fundamentally different characters..

Were you assaulted by a Marvel fan?

Why do you despise them so much....it sounds like you think a Marvel fan **CAN'T** be a DCEU fan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't have any problems with that scene for a long time after I had watched the movie.

One day, I had a random conversation with a truckie while getting coffee. He was discussing the troubles of driving a truck, it was a very interesting conversation.

Months later, after remembering the truck driver while rewatching MoS - the scene didn't work for me anymore. 

He sexually harassed the waitress and poured beer on Clark, the dude was a raging asshole. Clark had the right idea in the beginning, that man needed to be kicked out. I still don't understand why he didn't....

The waitress said, "it's not worth it sweety" and Clark suddenly stopped....why?

I believe throwing him out was an acceptable level of punishment for the man.

After several hours, the man goes outside to find his truck destroyed and skewered with a telephone pole.

How did they not hear anything in the bar when Clark was doing this?

Furthermore, Clark's actions means that not only will this man lose his job, his family will also be affected. The punishment was too severe for the crime and effected more people than just him. I would've actually preferred it if Clark just grabbed the man's sweater and dragged him out of the bar.

His actions in this scene went against his good upbringing.

	<TEXT> Yeah, not like it was #1 for 4 weeks in a row on home media.

It's not like BvS had the luckiest release slot, the only other movie competing with it being *My Fat Greek Wedding 2*.

BvS had 21 days without another major release, until the Jungle Book released on April 15.

	<TEXT> It's only redundant because you don't seem to understand that making her movies about the boring ass gods is a disservice to what she was created for.

I will say this for the last time.

OP asked what we wanted in the WW sequel.

I don't want a movie **about** the Gods....I want a movie **with** the Gods.

If you can't understand the difference, I can't help you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah it's just stupid and ultimately pointless unless they want to just make her Xena

LOL

Wonder Woman has always been linked to the Gods.

Her first origin story in the comics was being sculpted from clay and given life by Athena. She was also given super powers as "gifts" by the Greek Gods.

So why is seeing the Gods in a WW movie suddenly turning her into Xena.

It's extremely redundant to discuss any further.

	<TEXT> Why? They have little to do with Wonder Woman. 

Because Darkseid has had encounters with the Gods and I want an interaction in the future.

Because if you really wanted that there's little to no chance we'll see Wonder Woman at all with that nonsense crammed in there for no other purpose than "they are cool".

Why do you keep on assuming I want the whole movie to be about the Gods?

Are you telling me an establishing shot of the Pantheon and a few minutes revealing the Gods is hard?

I don't even care if it's a end credit scene...as long as it's in the sequel. </TEXT>

I'm saying that there's a big chance she doesn't know her real origin.

In her youth, her powers were already too strong for a normal Themiscyran


But don't make a whole movie that continues her journey into the modern world a century's step backwards and all about gods that don't really do much in the DCEU world to begin with.

	<TEXT> When?

In the [Comic-Con trailer](https://youtu.be/5lGoQhFb4NM?t=56), she says that she was broght to life by Zues.

However, there seems to be a secret origin, since in the new trailer.....Hippolyta says "she must never know the truth of what she is".

Finally, the lightning she emits makes it all seem that Zues might be her blood father.



Reducing her just a female Hercules is one of the biggest missteps of the N52, and it will be a huge disservice to her history and character if that's all they did with her in future movies.

I don't see what's wrong with it.

It's already been confirmed that both Zeus and Ares exist in the universe, why is it so hard for the Olympic Gods to exist as well?

I find Diana being a demi-god an extremely interesting idea to explore, so I disagree with you.

He discusses movies and box office and I consider it entertainment.

There is nothing "fake" about his platform, he posts videos and thousands of people watch and enjoy his content.

	<TEXT> You say you want gods, which they are only ever prominent in N52 as the main storyline as a primary role in Diana's life. Someone says they are dead in the N52, then you say that they don't have to follow the N52.

You want a movie to primarily be focused on gods but you don't want directors to follow the one storyline they are heavily featured in her history.

...and the problem with that is?

From the trailers, it seems that Zeus is her father [Rumour].

Are you saying the DCEU can't use characters from the N52 in a different way?

The Doomsday in the DCEU is totally different from the one in the comics, did Snyder have any trouble changing the character to fit the story?

So, what's stopping them from using the Olympian Gods and changing their story to fit in the DCEU.

	<TEXT> So if Campea's rage is towards DCEU and WB, it's unfounded. 

How is it unfounded.

It was officially released that Affleck would leave as director, this garnered a negative reaction from him as he shared what he was thinking about regarding the situation.

 Making rants against a studio for making a film that is decent but a disappointment at worst is not something any mature journalist should do and be let off as "not doing anything wrong".

So you basically want to throw out a large majority of film criticism?

People sharing their opinions is what this whole medium is about.

If he wants to rant about his frustrations, he has every right to.

If alcholism is an open secret then explain why that woman made a rude comment about it.

....because she's an asshole?

Didn't you see the uncomfortable glances of pretty much everyone when she said that?

It's an open secret, and it was rude of her to even joke about it.

Harloff basically goes into damage control mode after she says it......passing it off as a joke.

You're just enable horrific behaviour in those who have a platform. A platform that thankfully I don't follow.

That's your choice.

I love how free media is today. 

I also love Campea's thoughts on movies.

And yeah, Campea is an asshole.

That is also an opinion you have every right to have.

I'm happy Affleck stood up to admit his alcoholism, but it seems you don't grasp my argument.

His alcoholism was an open secret in Hollywood, but nobody reported it due to common courtesy.

Campea didn't treat Affleck differently, when the news of him leaving the Batman was announced....he reacted like he was always going to react.

He didn't blame Affeck for leaving Batman, his rant was focused on WB and the DCEU in general.

Why is Campea suddenly an asshole then?

	<TEXT> I don't understand the hatred.

Ben Affleck, while going through Alcoholism - was able to star in "The Accountant", direct "Live By Night", star in BvS and shoot Justice League.

It's clear that Affleck was a high functioning alcoholic...meaning they treated him like every other director and not with kid's gloves. You wouldn't believe just how common alcohol and drug abuse is in Hollywood...

When he left as the director of Batman, Campea reacted in a way that was natural to him. He didn't change his opinions or his demeanour because Affleck was an alcoholic...because that is not his business to interfere in.

Do you want Collider's (or any other media website) opinion to change because of the Director's personal life?

*"Transformer 5's trailer looks like trash but Michael Bay's kitten died yesterday so we'll go easy on him"*

It's a slippery slope.

	<TEXT> I was browsing the sub as usual when I read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/5zntaj/discussion_ben_shapiro_political_commentator/dezxsvm/) comment.



Shortly after, I read a piece written by a fellow DCEU fan called, ["Why BvS is the sequel to MoS instead of MoS 2"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/5zphlz/discussion_why_bvs_is_the_sequel_of_man_of_steel/)

Almost a full year has passed since BvS and I have been constantly asking myself the same question, "How could it have been improved?"

I think I finally have the answer and wanted share my thoughts. The sequel to MoS and the second movie in the DCEU should have been a Batman movie.

In the beginning, I hated this idea. 

I love the original premise of BvS, Batman's paranoia after the BZ event pushing him to kill Superman. However, after seeing just how much of the movie focused on Batman/Bruce Wayne - I realised that a Batman movie would be necessary.

So my idea is a Batman movie set during the same time period as MoS. The movie would give the general audience a clear indication of the type of person **this** Batman was pre-BZ event.

It would be a typical Batman movie.....while also alluding to important events in MoS such as Zod's message and the capture of Lois Lane by the FBI.

The end of the Batman movie would be a bigger exploration of the BZ Event. A large portion of the movie would be focused on Bruce Wayne the CEO and his employees at Wayne Financial, who we got to learn more about in this movie. 

This would make their death far more heart wrenching.

The movie would end where BvS began, Bruce holding on to a little girl as he looked on in anger at the destruction. The only thing I would add is a scene a few days later where a news castor is exploring the damage the BZ event caused, the death toll, Bruce Wayne and the brave fire fighters winning an award for valour after helping save countless lives lost in the rubble.

The movie would end with a speech Lex Luthor makes to the world in front of his destroyed building. He invites everyone to attend - a small informal/makeshift vigil for the people of Metropolis (which attracts a significantly large crowd). The speech continues as they show people crying, officials carrying the dead in masks, the morgues overfilled with numerous bodies shrouded in white.

Empty streets....looking like a scene from *I Am Legend*.

The camera focuses on Lex Luthor as he makes his last statement, laced with malice.

**Luthor:** *".....and now we pray"*

The end credit scene would be Batman putting on a VR headset and telling Alfred to *"begin the simulation"*.





That would be the end of the movie.

BvS would have the same premise, except Batman has practised fighting Superman using VR as a way to train and was smart enough to learn Superman's real identity.

it's a lot more difficult to make a movie than an animated movie. Two very different mediums with very different sets of expectations and limitations.

You are right, I just think their animated division is incredibly talented. 

Animated Directors as talented as Chris Mckay could direct lesser known properties.

I think WB has to think about the future, cultivating amazing directors in house will become extremely valuable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry but "Hack Snyder" isn't a well written criticism. Which is the majority of what people spout. Also these "well written" gems include "delusional fanboys". "WB can't make a good film". I can go on.

Yet another generalisation.



The people I was talking about don't write those comments but explain their opinions in a respectful manner.

Majority. lol. You are some sort of special person to ignore that the majority are just schadenfreude



I've said this already, people who spout comments like that are either Trolls with an alternate account or a loud minority that enjoy writing vitriolic comments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are basically saying anyone with a mouth can make accurate criticisms against film and the industry.

Anyone with a mouth could discuss film....but someone who studies film could do it in a far more elaborative and deeper way.

Studying film at USC and then leaving without even touching a camera makes you not at all knowledgable on how to make a film in the movie industry. Maybe indie films, but certainly not blockbusters. 

They might not be able to direct a blockbuster, but they have acquired enough knowledge to discuss a movie in depth.

Film school is not easy, a friend of mine left Medicine to become a director - within an extremely short period of time.....his understanding of movies and the technical components astounded me.

Also, shouldn't it say something that they dropped out of the film industry to do something else. Like....I don't know...they fucking sucked at studying film in school?

Who said they dropped out?

I seriously don't know where you got that assumption. </TEXT>

Space camp doesn't give you the qualifications of an astronaut.

Doing a degree in Journalism makes you qualified to be a journalist and doing an Arts (English)/Screenwriting degree makes you qualified to be a screenwriter.

So while they may not be "talented", they are qualified and knowledgeable in their chosen field.

Furthermore, Ebert was alive at a time when information and knowledge was hard to come by....he taught himself the nuances of film.

That is no longer necessary.

	<TEXT> The rest nowadays are just glorified opinions who have little to no perspective of what it takes to make a movie, let alone a good one.

Roger Ebert lived in an age when everybody couldn't be a reporter or a critic. However, the internet has given a voice to everybody...including me and you. 

They don't have to make a bad movie to have true insight, since Hollywood has become far more transparent. 

Uwe Boll makes horrible movies, but you wouldn't trust his review of a movie, now would you?

Ebert's failed movie should show you that a person can be a critic/reporter and still be unable to make a great movie.





The majority of these people you consider "talentless" have all gone to university or have been involved in some part of the movie business.

WB are seriously spoilt when it comes to talent.

They have some really amazing writers and directors in the animated division that could work amazingly in the DCEU.

I loved Man of Steel but it had a few sticking points that were compounded by the abysmal BvS. The DCEU films shouldn't appeal to critics, but they should at least hold the interest of casual comic fans.

Wholeheartedly agree.

The recent bad reviews of Ironfist should show that nothing is immune from critics.

If they like a movie/show - they write something good and vice-versa.

As long as WB make good movies, critics will write reviews praising the movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sick and tired of always saying this...so I'll keep it short.

- Hope and Optimism can exist in a "heavy" movie.

- People didn't want a feel good movie, they just wanted a balance. Since Batman was the dour, angry one - Superman should've been the opposite. It's that clash of ideals and personality that should've been accentuated in the fight.

Instead, both Batman and Superman are constantly angry and there is no shred of hope.

If you've watched Logan, ask yourself this question - why isn't the movie called "too dark"?

You constantly try to put the DCEU on a pedestal, as if they're doing something different......they're not.

If the propaganda of "hope and optimism" is being shoved down people's throats even before the films are released, how can one logically expect to feel any real tension?

A story needs levity for there to be tension, otherwise - the audience wouldn't care. 

It's why disaster movies always begin with a normal family enjoying life, the audience knows what's at stake for the protagonist....hence creating tension. 

Realistic politics like we saw in BvS.

LOL Is that why Luthor wasted his time with a junior senator from Kentucky?

Why did BvS act like Finch was the only person who could help him?

There are hundreds of Senators who would've glady accepted bribes from Luthor and given him access to Zod. 

Lex didn't even need the African incident, the BZ Event was enough. The senators could easily pass a bill by using the media and reminding citizens about the people they lost that day - allowing Lexcorp access to the body.

the non humorous relationship between mother and son. That kind of drama. That's the DC I like

Geez, why is your life so black and white.

Are you saying there can't be hope and optimism in a movie that explores a heavy subject matter?

I was just hypothesising on just how much exposure they've had with "the streets'.

You don't have to be street smart to be kind and giving.

BB's Thomas Wayne was able to see parts of the city he usually wouldn't be able to see.

BB's Thomas might be more adept with a situation like that, compared to BvS's Thomas.

	<TEXT> I can understand that, but not everyone has that mentality. "It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees" is a philosophy many people share. It's a Gotham City thing

I had an interesting theory I wanted to share about Thomas Wayne in both BvS and BB.

Anybody who has frequented dangerous parts of the city know to avoid confict when a person has a gun. In Batman Begins, it was established that Thomas spent a lot of time helping the city....meaning he had a lot of exposure in the seedier parts of Gotham City.

While his actions prior to his death may seem cowardly, I believe it comes from his understanding of people like the gunman. Since he had spent the majority of his life helping people, he knows how far people can go when life pushes them on the fence.

Thomas in BvS is different.

During the scenes with Alfred and Bruce, we learn about the Wayne's history in Gotham....they're essentially royalty - their family being a part of the city's history for hundreds of years.

This results in a Thomas who's sheltered from the outside world......his family mansion is situated in the middle of a large estate which is isolated from the outside world.

While Thomas has lived in Gotham his entire life and might've been physically strong enough to protect himself....he is not street smart.

When the gunman appeared, Thomas' anger surfaced.

*How dare he point a gun at my family?*

His attack didn't come from a defensive necessity but out of anger (the clenched fist).

So while Thomas in BvS may seem gruffy and hands on...it's actually BB's Thomas who takes that title.

	<TEXT> but someone pointing a gun at your wife and kid is more than enough to trigger that kind of self defense reaction. Even if it's not the perfect way to handle things.

Thomas's actions in BvS didn't feel like a reflex reaction to save his family.....It felt deliberate.

He slowly moves in front of Bruce and clenches his fist. He then attacks, which shows it was premeditated.

When did the muggler say that all he wanted was their wallet? I mean sure, their belongings were probably the only thing he went for.

You said it yourself, the only thing he wanted was their material possessions. I would understand if the family was poor and the thief is taking their hard earned savings......but they're not.

A wallet full of cash, a pearl necklace, a designer handbag and a watch is more than enough to make the gunman a hefty payday.

Killing them would just make matters worse for him.

Bravery =/= taking the most reasonable and perfectly thought out course of action.

I think every man has this incessant need to protect his family. Our first urge is to attack anyone who hurts our family.

Thomas' actions is sadly all too common.

Which is why I find it more courageous when someone stays calm in that situation to protect his family and avoids any theatrics/heroism.

However, you do make a great point and I do agree that bravery comes in all forms. </TEXT>

Thomas is worth more alive than dead.

He's a billionaire.

A calm Thomas could have given his wallet to Chill and explain that killing him would serve no purpose...

Why do you think police officers and the FBI use hostage negotiators?

There are times when violence is just not the answer.

If he was killed, then all it would mean is that Thomas died unfairly and he did everything right.

Ras used their death to anger Bruce while training him.

Ras' goal was to mould Bruce into a perfect LOS soldier, one who despises his father's actions.

His father's actions were brave and smart, Bruce has every right to be proud of him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is not being brave.

Even the most experienced martial arts experts would tell you not to instigate a fight. 

The gunman here (who I presume to be Chill) simply wanted Thomas' wallet. Since he's a literal multi billionaire....losing said wallet would be nothing for him.

Instead, he showed aggression and got shot.



It's why I love the Batman Begins scene.

Thomas did everything Chill wanted and was still shot.....the futility of his parents' murder that day is what created Batman.

In BvS, it was Thomas' actions which triggered the murder of Bruce's mother and father.



I think the line "You're not brave, men are brave" is simply mocking Superman's immense power. He doesn't have to be afraid of anything. 

He's not putting his life on the line to save people.

However, normal humans endanger their lives to help people everyday....hence, humans are more courageous than an all powerful alien. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mediocre? I consider it the worst show I've ever seen. I mean, Jesus Christ. What have you given a 1/10?

I consider the first season a 3/10, but the second season was fairly mediocre (4-5/10).

Even the worst anime deserve more than 1/10....however I consider the Oreimo specials a particular dumpster fire that deserves a 0/10. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And yes, it could in theory. But personally, I would find that boring as fuck(although knowing this sub, it would probably become AOTY)

Think of it like House of Cards.

The protagonist is trying to get as much money as he can, so he could become an aristocrat. He's lived as a failure his entire life - so the Isekai world is his sandbox.

He slowly climbs the ranks of society, getting stronger and controlling more and more.

However, the higher he goes, the more dangerous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which might as well be pointless, since most isekai are action shows so this won't help in the slightest.

Who said they have to be action orientated?

All I said is, you're trapped in an Isekai....what would you do?

There is no plot, no "action" - just the realisation that you are in another world all of a sudden and you have to act.

And even if he is an engineer, it could be that the methods to build the things he could theoreticly built aren't invented or known by him.

I'm pretty sure a civil engineer could improve how buildings in that world are built.

Perhaps introducing termite protection for the wooden frames. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most things which are easy enough to create by a high schooler are fairly useless.

It was explored in Log Horizon, but don't you think an invention as inconsequential as the burger - would make the person incredibly rich?

It's not even that hard.

Any student knows the ingredients to a burger. He could work for a few months to get seed money and sell his food on a cart.

He/she would become extremely rich pretty quickly.

	<TEXT> Thing is, not a lot of people now how to create modern technology.

It doesn't have to be modern technology.

For example, a High Schooler would probably use his knowledge of simple ideas, like creating Hamburgers and fries in this new world.

An adult specialised in a field, would focus on something he/she knows.

The sky's the limit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure most high schoolers don't actually know how to make all those technologies when you literally have to build it from scratch.

It doesn't have to be something complicated like a mobile phone.

Even though we've used them for the majority of our lives, people don't really know how fridges, microwaves and computers work.

An invention could be anything you have enough knowledge to recreate.

From a trebuchet to a burger.....anything new that you can recreate with relative ease.

What would that be for you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why don't they ever try to use knowledge from their own world (Earth) and apply it to this new world they've found themselves in?

I think the closest I've seen to this was Zero no Tsukaima, but in Saito's case - the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter (WWII aircraft) was already there.......all he had to do was recreate kerosene and repair it.

If I had the money to fund an anime project, it would be a 2-cour series about an unemployed man who found himself in an Isekai. 

Instead of wasting his time with love/harems and other bullshit, he realises that he has a second chance at life and use what little knowledge he has of our world's inventions/ideas to his advantage.

Apologies for the diversion....I wanted to ask a question.

*If you suddenly found yourself in an Isekai world with magic, what invention/idea would you "re-invent" to gain influence, money and power.*

Remember, inventions like cars (with combustion engines) would be useless, since people in this world would probably be using magic to run their vehicles.

	<TITLE> DISCUSSION: After seeing young Wonder Woman in the new trailer, I had an idea I wanted to share. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> After seeing the WW trailer and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/5yx6e1/fanmade_small_trinity/), I had a sudden epiphany for a great marketing idea WB could employ for Justice League.

How amazing would it be, if they got Brandon Spink (young Batman), Cooper Timberline (young Superman), Emily Carey (young Wonder Woman) and three other child actors to [pose as the Justice League](http://imgur.com/a/veCIH).

WB could also use the slogan, "Be the hero you were born to be"

It would be great marketing, but also get young children who were not alive during the animated series' run to get hyped for JL.

However, this would mean pre-casting Cyborg, Aquaman and Flash's younger actors before their subsequent movies.

What do you all think?

"Is She With You" fit in BvS, but I hope they give her a theme that fits with her Themiscyran orgins. 

Perhaps a theme influenced by Greek/Middle Eastern music.....something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp3pWCzh1hw) </TEXT>

Diana's [monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9On72iaEL0 feature=youtu.be t=113) at the end feels a bit....off.

I can't call it bad acting, but it doesn't have enough conviction/emotion behind it. </TEXT>
