	<TEXT> Graph paper would've been perfect for this, but I couldn't find any around the house and since it's a snow day I didn't want to go out to get some.

	<TEXT> I live in a Newfoundland town of a couple thousand where a good percentage of the infrastructure is at or below 2.5m above sea level. Roads, bridges, homes, businesses, public property (including museums, historic sites, recreational facilities, wharves, etc.). I don't look forward to the day when moving these things becomes a reality. Frankly, I think a lot of these things will be lost - there won't be the time, money, population, or will to relocate or rebuild them. I'm looking to buy a new home right now, preferably one close to the ocean, but looking down on it from well above. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yes, I forgot about the CDC. But there was literally nothing they could do - it was rigged to blow as soon as it ran out of generator power. And it's not even like they could've gotten more fuel since Jenner kept it from them until the last moment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Destroyed:

- The Greene Family Farm (was probably doomed anyways after the creek dried up)

- Woodbury (although they did adopt many of the Woodbury refugees)

- The Prison (didn't destroy it directly, but couldn't keep it safe from hyper aggressive neighbours)

- Terminus (probably for the better)


Didn't Destroy:

- The Nursing Home

- Grady Memorial Hospital (but may have set events in motion that would have destabilized it)

- Alexandria (still exists so they technically didn't destroy it, but it has certainly gone through extensive hardship since they arrived)

- Oceanside (minimal contact, and give credit to Tara for keeping them safe even after they tried to kill her)
- The Kingdom (minimal contact so far)

- Hilltop (they've taken an active role in keeping Hilltop safe)

- The Sanctuary (although they probably will destroy it, which would be deserved)


I'd say they actually have a pretty good track record. I think they made some bad judgement calls at the farm and at Alexandria. In all the other situations they basically made the best of what they had to work with.

	<TEXT> was in a bar once where i saw a girl with a ridiculously long piece of toilet paper dangling out of her pants. i hesitated to tell her because the "friends" she was with were all laughing at her behind her back and it would've been awkward to the point of confrontational to tell her about it in front of them. had just gotten out of my seat to tell her when another random stranger got to her first. such a painfully awkward situation, not just because of the toilet paper, but because of the "friends". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> right there, just inches away. i can't think of another scenario where having sex that close to a third another person without their consent wouldn't be sexual assault or at least gross indecency. only makes it worse that the third person is a child. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some games are mostly text, but that doesn't mean there was a lot of text. I'm thinking games based on gameshows, like Jeopardy! and Family Feud. It's been decades since I've played either of those so I can't remember how long it took to run out of new questions/answers.

	<TEXT> well a large, portion is paid out in winnings mostly to one or a small number of individuals while everyone else loses. and then there is the cost of running the lottery - staff, marketing, production costs, etc. and then there are the societal costs, such as the perpetuation of problem gambling, and the fact that i have to spend an extra 10 minutes in line at the corner store every time i go because some poor shmuck in front of me is buying and opening nevada tickets one at a time. so if $70B were taken in in taxes and distributed efficiently it would theoretically be money much better spent than having $70B in lottery revenue. </TEXT>
