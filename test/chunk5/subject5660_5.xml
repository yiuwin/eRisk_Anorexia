	<TITLE> I hate the parry in all the games and I wish it would be changed or removed. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-26 22:51:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> DS games must be in my very highest echelon, they are the closest thing to the perfect, but the parry is one of the worst obstacles to that perfection. 

I'm gonna try my best to illustrate why I hate it.

- It encourages boring gameplay.

You have an enemy, and you have so many interesting ways of fighting him, but all you actually have to do is get close to him and press one button? I'm sorry but that is just dull. The game just sort of lets you know, that if you sharpen your reflex enough, about 90% of it is the same animation. 

A good example for me is when I tried watching DS players on youtube or twitch, pretty quickly I noticed that it was really boring because all they did was parry. Every time I was like "Omg I really can't wait to see how is this fight gonna turn out...Oh...a parry..."

So its boring to play and its boring to watch. Yes in the beginning when you start learning it, it isn't boring, but it feels more like a gamble. I guess the best comparison to it would be is like you watch somebody play or you play a shooter game with an aimbot, its just boring. There is just something about it that feels off and disconnected to the rest of the game. Like some ace in the sleeve that trumps all other ways.


- It ruins PvP.

Honestly I wasn't even that much into PvP, but maybe it was because of the parry. Again, watching very good players or playing against them is incredibly not-interesting. You just know what they are gonna do and how. I have seen players in PvP that just are to afraid to attack each other because of the parry. This also stinks a lot, because when they are forced into a situation where they can't use a parry, the fight is so much more interesting to watch or be part in. 

In summation, I wish the parry was changed somehow.How? I don't know I am not payed to design games, but I know for me and a lot of people I tried getting into DS it was incredibly irritating. Even more so, since we had LOADS of fun without ever using it or very rarely, both in PvE and PvP. My instincts tell me it shouldn't be so powerful and have such a glaring skill curve, it should feel difficult to pull of but it shouldn't be so easy to skilled players.

Maybe make it use a lot of stamina? Or some other limitation? 

EDIT: Just let me be clear on one thing, I wish the removed/changed the parry in FUTURE games, I think its too late for the current ones. 

EDIT2: 

Put yourselves in shoes of someone who never played/saw Dark Souls. You see this EPIC knight boss with a cool intro, the symphonic music starts roaring and he looks like's gonna tear apart the player, he jumps and....

Some little bitch ass shield stops him in his tracks, and then some  lame excuse for a toothpick cuts down half of his health....  </TEXT>

As matter of fact, I do not take people who criticism American presidents seriously, because they criticism EVERY president like he was the worst ever and ruined the country. Usually its democrats hating Republican presidents and vice versa, like fucking football fans.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love criticism. However! It is rather pointless to tirelessly criticize something for what it IS at its rawest. My point is, why do you go constantly to the same exact restaurant that only serves fish, when you always absolutely dislike it. 

At some point you are just being masochistic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have read the books, and I have to mention something.

Lately I have been trying to play Dragon Age:Inquisition since I was huge fan of Dragon Age:Origins. Believe me that game(DA:I) was only relevant because it was released before W3 came out. Anyway after a major event during the end of ACT I, our heroes freezing in the snow and are broken and sad, however one of them starts singing an inspiring song, the rest follow and so they get their spirits up. 

I cannot even begin to tell you how much second-hand embarrassment I felt, just how much cringe was there... It felt so forced, so juvenile, so "cliched", so tacky, like it was just manipulating me to feel something because I am supposed to... There is just no way a mature individual could have wrote something like that. It felt like a second-hand Disney... Then there are also the bards in taverns that sing songs, that feel so out of place. It feels like some modern teen pop star is trying to sing old folk tales or troubadour poems... 

Anyway comparing that to the feeling I felt when I watched listened Priscilla's song... I have read the books previously and played all the games at least once, so I was very familiar about what she is singing and how much it makes sense both as lorewise and how the song fits the feeling of the Witcher 3. No kidding, I felt like somebody was squeezing my heart with a tight merciless grip. I wasn't about to cry, but more to collapse or implode emotionally, because so many things were gotten so RIGHT in that moment. The type of music, the choice of the singer, how the lyrics fit internally the world and to use the audience outside, how Priscilla is not just randomly pulling strings, how Geralt a dry cynic who saw it all is genuinely enjoying a rare beautiful moment in his life... My mind rushed through a palette of emotions and memories, from the books, from my own life and my friends, to some philosophical thoughts about life love, existence, pain... 

That was all because of Sapwkowski's books and CDPR's game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I initially came across this thought by watching this [video](https://youtu.be/BgwpqaNa_Eg?t=535) . And I have to give the author some prompt, they were on a good hunch that their audience which is fairly wide and a significant portion of themselves would call themselves "nerds" or "geeks", would have no idea what a freakin' A10 warthog is.

At first thought, gah, it must be that their audience is just that niche, but then I remembered how fucking big SW audience is and how big its overlap is (Star Wars fans are not a tightly niche group) and how cool it is in last 10 years to call yourself a nerd or geek and be interested in various pop culture.

But if you are interested in the military porn you are "a nutt" or a "warmonger". 

Anyway, I think its kinda interesting that there is a significant portion of the US taxpayer knows less about their own military than about Star Wars vehicles.

	<TEXT> Correct, I forgot about that. Though I have heard all sides complain about this "Irish" has become a "cool" brand to brag about. As for Italians, well they are "ethnic" enough. 

However Swedes are "WHITE" as one can get. They are tall, blonde hair, blue eyes... Some people take issue with you being proud of that.

Now I personally think you cannot attack people for being proud of being white if you are not attacking people that are proud for being black. I think both sides are dumb, dangerous and cause division.

As a matter of fact, I find it despicable when somebody is proud of anything that they themselves didn't accomplish. You do not get to choose your skin colour, and there is nothing special about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously, what do you people want, why are you here, why do you even watch 2h long podcasts that you hate? 

A lot of people here seem to think that Joe is supposed give hardball interview's to guests they personally dislike or bring guests that preach a cause that fits them 100%.

A lot of people here and YouTube seem to INSIST that every guest has to be 100% with them on politics, otherwise all other things they say are irrelevant. 

A lot of people here seem to insist that every 10s Jamie should fact check and demand citations from the drunk and possibly high people having a friendly conversation.  

It's just that I get the impression there is a lot of anti-social and dare say autistic people here wanting some impossible standards from Joe, while I personally like his podcasts a lot because they remind me when I am in good company with some people or friends and when we talk stupid shit. You get good laughs, maybe learn something interesting or challenge an idea, but you don't end up being a  spiteful butthurt bitch that hates a person because they said something you don't like. Obviously Joe doesn't want that too, he clearly wants to relax,flex his mind and have a pleasant CONVERSATION not some clash of minds. 

EDIT: 

Something I should have mentioned. A lot of these people seem to take it as personal attack when Joe brings on controversial guests or when guests say something it doesn't fit their take on life and Joe doesn't immediately lambasts them over.

	<TEXT> What a load of bull, Christian Bale's Batman to me is really boring, and it always comes of as C.B. working really hard to be Batman, while Affleck is the FUCKING BATMAN and he does it like its effortless.

I will never forget the first teaser, where we saw him just as Bruce Wayne broodingly staring at his suit. It felt so convincing, so subtle, I could immediately see that this is an experienced, fucked up Bruce Wayne to the core. Then the scene where he glides and attacks Deadshot, I legitimately felt fucking scared. It felt like a bat demon stalking the streets. 

Christian Bale however, has to have many blank boring stares and give long expository monologues. I think its Christopher Nolan that carried those movies, not Bale.

I also have to say that Christian Bale and Leonardo Di Caprio have rabid fan followings on the internet, usually of people that only watch a few blockbusters, some Oscar bait and the movies of these respective actors, and then they INSIST they are the best at what they do. </TEXT>
