	<TEXT> Yeah that's true, but sometimes I feel those 'translations' of the book material are a lot more simplified. They get the point across, but sometimes it's a bit more in your face. I think this has got worse over the seasons.

For me, the beauty of the above passage is not the message, but the way it's told. *"Lions," she whspered* is just fantastic, and although the shows gets the overall point of the passage, it misses the nuance of GRRM's prose.

Not that that's a problem. It's just a result of the translation to TV. It happens with anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An exchange between Tyrion and Sansa just after Tyrion arrives back at King's Landing:

 His grin turned into something softer as he studied her face. "Is it grief for you lord father that makes you so sad?"

 "My father was a traitor," Sansa said at once. "And my brother and lady mother are traitors as well." That reflex she had learned quickly. "I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey."

 "No doubt. As loyal as a deer surrounded by wolves."

 "Lions," she whispered, without thinking. She glanced about nervously, but there was no one close enough to hear.

 "I am only a little lion, child, and I vow, I shall not savage you."

Such great writing from GRRM. It gives me chills. Great characterisation, great symbolism. Just all around fantastic. This is why we're all looking forward to TWOW so much. I love the show dearly, but it often misses the smaller and chilling moments from the books, like this one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also completely forgot to mention that the Dorne characters are kind of primary characters some of the time, and are not nearly deserving of that either...


Plus I think sometimes the writers simplify the characters of all of the secondary characters once they've moved into a great role, as they haven't spent as much time writing them in the past. The results in the sometimes sloppy writing people have been complaining about the last few seasons.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ... I feel it really misses a lot of the great actors and characters from earlier seasons. 


I'm talking about Charles Dance as Tywin, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey, Jason Momoa as Drogo, Sean Bean as Ned, Mark Addy as Rob, Richard Madden as Rob II, Rory McCann as the Hound (although get hype), Rose Leslie as Ygritte, Michelle Fairly as Caitlyn, James Cosmo as Jeor Mormont. 


IMO the characters in the first few seasons were so fantastic, as was all the acting, but then most of them got killed off (which had to happen, I'm not complaining about that), leaving us with characters that aren't as good in these last few seasons.


A lot of secondary characters (Brienne, Jorah, Ramsay, Theon, Roose, Varys, Sansa to some extent) got move into primary character roles, and I feel that most of them aren't good enough to take on that role. Don't get me wrong, I love Brienne, Jorah etc. like the rest of us, I'm just not sure if they've got enough weight to hold the show in the same way characters like Joffrey, Tywin, the Hound etc. did.


EDIT: I'm guessing this is going to be an unpopular opinion and get downvoted to hell.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the Saving Private Rickon point. I added that. 

I think splitting season 7 is a good way to extend the show without breaking the Seven Seasons That Were Promised. It allows them to add make more episodes, extend AFFC/ADWD into S6, then deal with TWOW and ADOS late S6 and all S7.

I also think it will be easier to condense later on in the story, particularly with all characters stories converging and characters dying all over the place.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Spoilers All) How Season 6 WON'T Spoil The Winds of Winter, and will feature more AFFC/ADWD material </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-09 11:31:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've seen an awful lot of talk about how much material from The Winds of Winter is going to be spoiled by Season 6. This is presuming the book doesn't come out before then. We can hope and pray, but from here let's just assume it won't (tragic, I know).


But I dont think that Season 6 will really spoil that much of Winds at all, at least not as much as everyone suspects.


Heres the bottom line: All the storylines that have been seemingly cut from AFFC/ADWD have actually just been replaced by filler material. These cut storylines will feature prominently in S6.

The producers are simply changing small things, delaying things, or reordering things so that they can produce filler now, and more book material later. 

This also applies for storylines that have been cut completely. *cough* Greyjoy *cough*


Here are some examples



#Jamie Fookin Lannister Fookin up the Riverlands

People truly believe that this storyline has been cut completely and replaced by Jaimes Dorne storyline. I believe that, really, Jaime going to Dorne is only delaying his visit to the Riverlands.

Nothing is stopping Jaime from visiting Dorne, returning to KL in early S6, and then heading off to settle down the Riverlands. In fact, not only does it work - *it makes sense.*

The Dorne storyline needed someone familiar to interest viewers. Jaime has served that role, and in doing so, is now ready to proceed onwards to the Riverlands.

This also leaves him open to an encounter with another character later in S6, but well come back to that later...



#Sam Tarlys Adventure to Oldtown

Again, another storyline that has been seemingly cut. However, if anything theyre setting up for Sam to go down there more and more. 

Obviously the producers cut Maester Aemons potential sacrifice a-la-Mel from the show, thus eliminating the need for Sam to take him away. The same goes with Gilly - theres very little impending danger for her at the beginning of S5, unlike the books. However, with the recent scene in Season 5 where Gilly was threatened, it seems D D are setting it up so that shell have to leave sooner or later.

In addition to this, Sam has been mentioning the Masters a few times lately (at least 1 or 2 episodes, more than usual) and even stated that he always wanted to be one. This is an obvious set up for an early S6 departure to Oldtown.

The important thing to note here is that neither Jaime nor Sams storylines have been drastically altered to the point where their AFFC/ADWD storylines couldn't occur next season. The changes basically have no effect at all.



#Mothers Mercy

So, lastly, the storyline we all love to hope hasn't been cut. 

This is very similar to the last two examples, in that nothing has happened that prevents the Brienne/Lady Stoneheart storyline from happening. For all we know, this Sunday the episode will end with a Lady Stoneheart reveal (straight from ASOS, pls D D) and thus S6 will find Brienne running into her and the BwB and then luring Jaime back to her. 

Again, the changes made to Briennes story simply dont mean that this cant happen. In fact, it almost seems more likely and more sensical to what the show is doing. They cant have as many storylines as the books, so for now theyre condensing them by sending certain characters to other storylines, only to play out their own storylines when room has been made in the shows lineup. 

It would also coincide nicely with Jaimes delayed story in the Riverlands.



#Saving Private Rickon

As /u/HolyHerbert pointed out, Davos still has to begin his magical adventure to rescue Rickon from the land of unicorns. Naturally, this begins in ADWD, so some book material could be used in the beginning, and then later slowly more OC might spoil the events of TWOW. ~~Not that anyone cares about Rickon's story being cut/spoiled anyway...~~



#The Greyjoy Watch

Will what is dead ever die? Hopefully yes!

Considering the recent casting calls, its clear D D are introducing Euron Greyjoy into the show in S6. Again, the main point here is that nothing has happened in the show that prevents the Greyjoy story from playing out in S6, and I think this seems very likely at this point.






###SO HOW DOES THIS AFFECT SEASON 6?

WELL, heres my proposition. I know D D seem set on 7 seasons. But someone else here recently posted that HBO might push to split S7 into two parts, with 8 episodes each year, resulting in a 16 episode Season 7.

I think this actually fits well with D D and their plan. Why? Its help them prolong ending the show before GRRM ends the books, and gives them more time. At the very least, it helps give George time to release TWOW. God fucking knows how this would work with ADOS, but were completely ignoring that for now. *shhhh*

**I suggest that Season 6 will feature more of characters storylines that were seemingly cut, and less of characters storylines that are up to, or past, book material.**

##Possible Season 6 Storyline Line-Up:

- **Bran:** He was excluded from S5, but I think well get periodic updates from him every couple of episodes looking through weirwood trees and discovering some blatant R+L=J foreshadowing with D D written all over it. 


- **Brienne:** Discovering Lady Stoneheart, enticing Jaime to come visit her


- **Jaime:** Riverlands diplomacy storyline from AFFC/ADWD


- **Greyjoys:** Kingsmoot, Victorian going on an adventure to claim Dany, more ~~Asha~~ *Yara*


- **Sam:** Journeying to Oldtown with Gilly


- **Dany:** Shitting all over her stone with Drogon, chilling with the Dothraki.


- **Jon:** Maybe??? Who fucking knows at this point. Maybe well just get 10 mins of Ghost running around after Jons permawarg each episode


- **Arya:** More training with the FM. The blind storyline from AFFC could come into play.


- **Kings Landing:** It is here that more material from TWOW would be spoiled than anywhere else. Cerseis trial (CB GET HYPE), the Tyrell trial, then Kevans return and impending murder by Varys. After that, filler material with Littlefinger, Olenna and the like would be very easy. 


- **Meereen:** Perhaps Tyrion, Daario and Jorah will have to deal with the plague from ADWD and the arrival of Victorian? Daario or someone else will probably also release the dragons. 

- **The North:** I would say mainly filler material here for S6. There would be very little of it but it mainly depends on the outcome of the Battle of Ice After the battle I suspect this storyline will become very low maintenance as well. 



Although this seems like a lot of POVs, when you consider only 5 or so are in each episode (with some of them getting very little screen time), it really isnt that much of a stretch.

It also means that TWOW material can be spoiled late S6 and first few episodes of S7 Part 1, only to have the last episodes of S7 Part 1 and all of S7 Part 2 covering ADOS.

**tl;dr: D D are merely delaying cut storylines from the books until space is cleared up for them. They will be featured in Season 6, thus giving George more time to write and D D more time to delay spoiling.**

**EDIT:** Added "Saving Private Rickon" thanks to /u/HolyHerbert

Sheeran still cites this as one of the best gigs he ever played. It was at an open mic/slam poetry thing (IIRC) and the audience was supposedly predominately black. He was already using his loop pedal at this point.

As you can see, by the end of the video everyone is getting involved - everyone had a rap and sung along. Ed said this is the song is plays when a gig is going bad, and it'll turn it around. He says this gig at Inglewood is definitive proof of that.

	<TEXT> Hi all,

I need some help. I've been catching up on HBO's GoT for a while now, and I've just finished the first ep of S4. I intend to continue watching s4.

However, I am also really really excited to read the books afterwards. The only problem is, I don't want to wait. I want to start Book 1 now, but I'm afraid this wouldn't be great whilst also watching S4. 

Any ideas?

	<TEXT> A bit of contex - the BBC were obviously so impressed they used this as the title sequence for series 8. Apparently it remains practically unchanged, except the seal of rassilon does not appear in the TV version. This has been confirmed by members of the audience.  </TEXT>
