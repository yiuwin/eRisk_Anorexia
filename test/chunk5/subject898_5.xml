"One bad decision after another, but these days he owns his past actions and does everything he can to give back to the wrestling business he loves,"

	<TEXT> As people have pointed out, the writers are very good, and Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg are producing it also (a first for a Franco directed film, and a very good sign). Outside of that, it has a very solid cast, great cinematographer (shot This is the End, The Night Before, Neighbors, etc) , and a great composer (did all the Breaking Bad music). So even though Franco has let me down as a director so far, it would be hard not to be hyped for this movie. Especially with the book being one of my all time favourites </TEXT>
