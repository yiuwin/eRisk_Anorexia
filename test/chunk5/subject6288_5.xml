	<TEXT> My sister does this and when I'm with her, it makes me cringe.

But, every once in a while if there's enough room, someone will squeeze in as close to her car on purpose and I can't help but to be like "well sis it's cause you're a dick." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would consider it but being in a place where I am still an adult child myself, I can't fully give an opinion for at least another...5 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is terrible and completely horrifying. I made the mistake of seeing if my cat would get better, knowing he had a brain tumor and that was completely my fault and I did it based on selfish reasoning. But, to end his suffering I had to choose putting him to sleep. The doctor let me sit in while they did it and I saw him shut his eyes and that was it. I started BAWLING and didn't stop even after getting home.

The only way I coped with it was realizing that the suffering was finally over and that my cat was finally in a better place with no more pain. And I also learned to never put my own wants and needs over what is best for a pet ever again. </TEXT>
