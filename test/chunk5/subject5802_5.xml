	<TEXT> lol you've got to be kidding me.  What about the ridiculous amounts of taxes most European nations have that are wayyyy more expensive than Americas?  You may have to pay extra for medical stuff, but most people in most years never have to.  However everybody has to pay taxes every single year.

It doesn't cost that much to get college degree.  You can get a college degree for less than 12,000 if you are smart.  People who go way into debt for college chose to do it themselves or made extremely poor decisions.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not the one believing a sub par passer is going to be a NFL QB.  He can't read the whole field.  They cut every read in half for him.  That's something a lot of high school QBs have to do.  It's almost unheard of for a college QB to do it, at any level.  NAIA QBs are expected to be able to read the entire field.  Anybody that is worth a broke pecker when it comes to football, understands this guy has MAJOR flaws that at this point probably aren't fixable.

It's hard finding the exact percentage of them in China because the religion is persecuted so much and people rarely openly profess it.  I've seen estimates say the Protestant numbers are anywhere between 10,000,000 and 50,000,000.  You can fact check me if you want to with a quick internet search  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it's the only local teams.  They fill the niche that Plymouth Argyle, Sheffield Wednesday, and other smaller soccer teams in England and other nations do.  Since there's only 32 NFL teams there's not very many teams, and if you don't live in or near a major city there's nothing to cheer for.  They give your town or city pride, it's your town vs another town.  Also it's kids and players that you may know personally.  Also it's YOUR school or college and you take pride in that.  When they win you are personally invested in it.  Far more so than when a team of professionals that you have 0 connection to in a big city that's hundreds of miles away wins a game.  

Also since there is no promotion/relegation college football is the third/fourth level so it's comparable to League 1   2 in the English soccer pyramid in terms of talent.  The rivalries are wayyyy more intense because it is more local.  I've seen some high school football rivalries that are way more intense than NFL games because it's two towns vs each other, and not random players from all across the nation like in the NFL

He turns the ball over in ridiculous amounts.  He has a terrible arm.

The only good thing he can do is run the ball and that doesn't work in the NFL.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who had cancer I literally want to fight you right now.  Weed doesn't cure cancer.  All you stupid pot heads always say that crap and it's not true.  If it were all I had to do was blaze up on medical marijuana and I would've been just fine.  The other stuff you said is mostly true but that's such a lie and it pisses me off that you people say that to further your agenda when there are people that literally have died from it or like me and went through hell but survived.  Weed doesn't cure cancer you have got to be kidding me.  There is no active ingredient in weed "that kills cancer cells," but I guess you know more about oncology than doctors who went to school for 12 years and people like me who actually had it.  

I don't care if you go blaze up behind the barn but weed isn't a magical drug that cures cancer.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok I mean literally every sport in America works that way, including MLS.  Nationally televised game = hype which equals = butts in seats.  Sorry I haven't done a 10 year long study to look into it.  That's why Monday   Thursday night football games get bigger crowds, NBA prime time games in Tuesday get bigger crowds, nationally televised MLS games get bigger crowds, etc.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few hundred less than full capacity is a sellout for all intents and purposes.
