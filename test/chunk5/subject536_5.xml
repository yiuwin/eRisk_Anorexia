	<TEXT> I was at my initial high school but still got good grades (humble brag). Because I did well in school I got into a STEM academy that I attend now, and there's much less wiggle room for slacking off sadly. I was also very athletic at my old high school and definitely not a slacker in competitive swimming (though I wasn't that good ehehe), but that was more due to body image issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm always SO uncomfortable when going to churches I feel like I'm getting personal call outs every five minutes when they preach. Also yeah it's boring; like, really boring. I love it though when everyone else is praying and I'm just sitting there and I make awkward eye contact with the other people not praying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Happy Holidays! I'm so glad this sub is here for me :) It's helped me so much.
I ate probably 1,500 calories in cookie butter and zucchini bread. At first I thought it was only 1,200 calories but I'm mistaken  Though that's all I've eaten and I've been drinking a huge amount of tea to uhh... cleanse my body, so I think I won't gain too much, I'm trying to not obsess over it and all. Tonight I'll be cooking with my mom though not eating anything. I'm spending Christmas with just her. Tomorrow I'll open my gifts and I guess we'll have dinner. Saturday we may go to a nearby city to shop. hopefully I'm not too bloated to clothes shop lol.
Thanks everyone for having such a great community and I hope you all have awesome holidays!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel that. If I can't get the clothing item in small I won't get it at all tbh. I can't admit that defeat. if my mom tells me something form fitting in a size small is too tight I just... I don't even know how to describe what I feel but it's not pleasant I can tell you that. Anyway I'm sorry someone who is supposed to love and support you tells you those things. That's horrible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have violin hips and they make me look like I have a muffin top no matter what! and while I'm totally dissatisfied with my body, my hips are like 32 1/2 inches and I can see my hip bones so I feel like I at least shouldn't have a muffin top. :( other than that I have naturally dry skin and thin, ugly hair and my ED doesn't help that nor the fact that my hair is bleached blonde now. I'm also average height and my shoulders are super broad. My boobs are shaped weird, though in glad they're small. Also my fingers are short and stubby as opposed to delicate and pretty. If there's one thing I'm lucky about, it's that my acne isn't so bad for a 16 y/o! </TEXT>
