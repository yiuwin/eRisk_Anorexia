	<TEXT> According to [this study](http://archive.news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2014/05/2013-american-journalist-key-findings.pdf), only 7.1% of American journalists are Republican (scroll down to page 12). It should be easy to tell, from this, why the mainstream media would be biased. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That graph says modern-day Democrats are more rightwing than the white supremacist Dixiecrats of the late 19th Century, which I find hard to believe. Also, why did the Dixiecrats become so much more conservative after WWI?

The Republican plot looks fine, save for the missing Progressive movement, but the Democrat plots are awkward. The graph does not come from a reliable source, so don't take it as gospel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 538 gave Trump about a 30% chance of victory on election day, far better than most sites.

The real bungle happened during the primaries. As late as January, 538 was still saying Trump had only a 12% chance of being the Republican nominee. That was bad -- but the post-nomination predictions were not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hm. There's a lot more happening here than I thought. I also noticed that the water turned green - is that because of the metal chloride, or chlorine gas being released from the cathode? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [These](http://imgur.com/gallery/YHHJh) are the pictures. I was running an electrical current through saltwater and just expected to see some bubbling from H2 gas, but I ended up making this weird brown substance. I'm not sure what the wires are made out of, but if it's copper, the substance might be copper chloride.

Also, is the glass still safe to use for drinking? I know copper chloride is toxic, so I washed it, but I'm not sure if I should drink out of it anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember reading a long time ago about a now-debunked theory that some organisms time their circadian rhythm using cosmic rays. There might not be any sources of food or danger that give off radiation, but would any cyclic, time-related function be useful? I'm guessing organisms that live in perpetual darkness would benefit the most from this. </TEXT>
