	<TEXT> So I opened up Crackle to watch the first few episodes of their new show [StartUp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_XSewKQQa0). At first I saw all 10 episodes available. Then while watching episode 2 I paused for a bit to take a break, I came back later and it wouldn't play. I reloaded it and it said it was [expired](http://imgur.com/V2NHeQ4). Anyone else have this problem? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-09-04 11:26:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Either just a lot of different plots or straight up hard to figure out. 

My answers would be:

**The Wire**. In the beginning I accidentally skipped and episode and I didn't notice because I was used to feeling lost while watching the show. It does get a little easier to understand as it goes on because you're used to how the characters talk and shit. 

**Orphan Black**. Either 90% of the mysteries in that show haven't been resolved yet or I'm just missing something. All of the genetic stuff about the cure and why they certain stem cells for whatever the hell they need to do doesn't make sense to me. I just kinda accept it as "they're working on a cure." Also the relationship between Neolution, the Prolethians, Project Leda, Project Castor, and Topside confuses me. Has it ever been made clear?

**House of Cards**. I get the gyst of it but all the political talks about getting bills past through the senate or vetoing shit goes over my head. I just really like Kevin Spacey.

**iCarly**. How can there be an elevator that goes directly into their apartment? Do they just have so many visitors that they have their own private elevator? Does Freddy's place have its own elevator? Did Spencer, with his infinite sculpting knowledge, somehow build their apartment around the elevator because he's too lazy to answer the door?  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-08-30 11:50:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I watch a lot of TV and every time I think of a good idea it's usually in terms of TV. Obviously there are things I can't do in a book that I could in TV (and vice versa). Is there a literary equivalent of little details in the background of a show. Like how in a show like Arrested Development you can rewatch it and notice little details in the background you didn't notice before. Like signs on buildings that say something funny and foreshadowing. 

The best I could think of is if maybe a character or the narrator off-handedly mentions a little detail that seems irrelevant but actually is very relevant. But it seems like it could be pretty obvious sometimes.  </TEXT>

When I was young my parents beat me for showing interest in other men. Then years later when I was finally brave enough to come out and try and find love, I was taken advantage of a sexually assaulted by the first man I ever dated. Now I'm too ashamed of who I am. I kept all these feelings hidden inside and they grew into a huge consuming darkness. [I wear a mask](http://m.imgur.com/3IDtPDU?r) in public and hide my true emotions.
