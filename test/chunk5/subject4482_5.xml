	<TEXT> So you want Valve to hire a person for the sole purpose of verifying reports based on dotabuff statistics, determined by arbitrary criteria and subjective judgment? Sounds like you've never worked in an office before.

I'm not gonna elaborate about how your idea is flawed, not because it isn't, but because you're stubbornly in denial as evident from your other replies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish his way of comedy is more popular among comedians. No reliance on swearing or sex to be funny.

	<TEXT> Yeah, it's not a joke or exaggeration. I once wanted my mom to buy me something that wasn't cheap, I knew that, but I really wanted it and I could see that my mom wasn't too agreeable about it. However, she approached the issue by avoiding the topic as much as possible and try to reason with me using utter bullshit which I did not realize at first as a child. The realization hit me eventually and it really broke me, feeling that I had been treated as a joke all along. In turn, the idea of a family felt like a joke to me and I basically lost all respect for my mom in that moment. I began wanting to be more independent (for better or worse) and subconsciously hated things that require me to get help from my mom. 

I'm fine with my mom now but really, till this day I am unable to fully forgive and forget of that incident. It doesn't bother me emotionally in my daily life anymore but whenever I think about it it's like there's an inner voice telling me that I was perfectly right to resent my mom and I should keep it that way.

That's basically what happened to feminism and to a lesser extent communism, causing them to be viewed negatively on the surface.
