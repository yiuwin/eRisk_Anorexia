	<TEXT> Without out the balance of nature we would not be able to survive. Every species relies equally on other species to keep everything in sync. Thinking that humans are the only ones that matter is not only a very selfish way to think (we ALL occupy this planet) but to me, it's also stupid. We have absolutely no idea what would happen to our planet if certain species went extinct. So; if for self preservation alone, I think we need to try our hardest to make sure we all live peacefully </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same, oh my gosh. The feeling of wind in your ears...nothing beats that feeling!
I adore Dexter! You'll like it. Spartacus; believe it or not, is way more sexual and violent than Game of Thrones lol. If you can stomach it though, the plotline is superb. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I'd have to say I agree with you on that. :D French history in general has always interested me. Sometime during the Renaissance in Italy or during the reign of Elizabeth I in England would be pretty awesome as well. </TEXT>
