	<TEXT> I wondered as I couldn't find an explanation. When it states viewed: 'number' does this mean that many people viewed this page, opened one episode or opened all episodes? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> One Piece movies - Should I (not seen any Onepiece) watch it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-06 22:33:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not watching the series but I'd like to watch a movie that screams onepiece. I heard an OST from the movie Gold and now I'm asking should I watch the movie if I'm totally unfamiliar with Onepiece? Or which movie should you recommend that's best for me? Or should I not watch any movie and start the series? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looking for a Combo play vs Big Creature decks, they don't have to be one of the Magic clash/duel packs! but they have to be balanced against each other. (They may definitely be deeper to play!) </TEXT>
