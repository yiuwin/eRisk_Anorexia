	<TEXT> Yeah even though everyone always says that never drink before climbing i actually think it's not bad to drink a bit (not until you're drunk but just to get rid of the worst fear or whatever) we all know our limits personally im a 18 year old and 1-2 cans of beer is usually enough (just so you get some sort of understanding of what i mean)
Also if you can try to find something that's high but has more ladders than just 1, if for example one ladder takes you to 5m, the other to 8m and so on it might feel a bit safer

Personally i just climbed a crane (none of that hanging from one shit or risking anything just ladders and not even the straight ones) with my mates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah so my main just got permabanned and I was super close to diamond figured i'll just rank up my smurf from gold iv since its my main now i guess lmao. So how much would it cost to go from gold iv to diamond v or plat v? I might have some huge school projects coming and can't play by myself. The account gets 20-25 lp per win so it wont take long, i might be able to play by myself so not sure yet if i need the boost or not

	<TEXT> Aight so idk if it's just me but 8.50/h would totally be enough for rent? I mean you live alone right? The rent CAN'T be more than like 700$
If you work 8 hrs a day 5 days a week thats approx 23 days of work per month which means youll earn roughly 1550$ (math might be a bit off but close to that) so you'll have 800$ to use for food for one person and some bills. Idk bout' you but that's definitely enough for me. And if you get more for working in the weekends that all adds up too, even if it's just 4 hrs a day.

Good luck but it seems like youll get by </TEXT>

Now that my vacation is over and I'm back to school I'm trying to get a proper sleeping schedule, but every time after sleeping for like 9 hours i get headaches and feel just shit. Mornings are easier because im not as tired but the days are so bad compared to the days after sleeping 4-6 hours. I'm so confused and in desperate need of advice

But yeah, i get your message and point, i guess there's no reason for riot to reset the bans. Only problem i have is that basically a thing that'd get you 5 game chat ban can get me perma banned :P 
Wouldn't it make more sense if harsher stuff such as inting etc. would get you banned and flaming would just get you longer and longer chat bans. If you however flamed during the chat bans you'd then risk of getting banned. 

I've been playing the game for quite a while and the amount of toxic people have definitely not been dropping, rising with the active players if anything. Clearly this isn't working as well as they planned to. Still, i accept my punishment. Kinda. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to share my personal opinion even though I'ts not allowed. Hopefully I'm polite enough to not get ass-sexed by the greater people :(

So yeah, I never understood food review channels, tech review is one thing, like opening the package and showing what's in it, how to boot it or make it work. But food? Why? What's the point of seeing someone else say 'wow this bread's really good!' What exactly does it give you? Sure, why not make these videos if he wants to, but i personally don't see why you'd make them and will never watch them again (seen like 2/3 so i can give my opinion) simply because i think they're waste of time :) 

Thank you for reading and wish the guy tasting different foods on camera the best of luck with his.. hobby? job? well, you get it. </TEXT>

If someone doesn't i tend to tell them to fuck off stop playing the game and start making decisions that aren't based on their single digit iq brains ideas :) Guess i'll get banned eventually again, just a matter of time.  </TEXT>
