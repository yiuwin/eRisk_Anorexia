Inte nog med att fjortonringen fick en kniv i knt efter att hon kastat en krabba, hon satt dessutom fast i leran i flera timmar. Ingen notering om hon fick behlla den antika kniven efter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I guess I don't believe in everything that's being claimed online to start with, which may explain having doubts in the first place. Those two have problems, that's all we know. Who's to blame or whatever is to be considered normal behaviour here, isn't all that clear is all I'm saying. Is it actually normal (or healthy even) to "settle arguments" this way? 

edit: Please note that my question is in earnest. </TEXT>

To me, that indicates a less than healthy attitude from the guy, to begin with and gives me the kind of pause you're reflecting. Is that so "normal" or "acceptable" or whatnot? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are probably loads of reasons for it, but I think you are quite right that this is one of the reasons. I figure it's a kind of social glue or whatnot, and probably really common. Nothing brings a group together more than a common "enemy" so to speak. It most likely has got very little to do with the people being graded on the outside, and loads to do with the kind of points you can score inside of the group, I figure. It's a human trait - a strength and a weakness depending on the situation, I guess. Women does this too, when bonding, sadly it's not uncommon to trash-talk other women. It's one of my experiences in life, that if you're not ready to "hate" whatever or whomever a group requires you to, you're going to be a rather lonely person. No idea how to tackle that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Though, I'm not at all certain that "the losers of society" are there because of biological reasons. That's probably more due to financial policies - another pipedream of course - but getting rid of poverty most likely would rid the world of most of the existing criminality. That said, it probably wouldn't prevent passion of crime and whatnot, but I guess we're talking about rather big things here that requires at least one bottle of wine, and loads of time. Biology used as an excuse, is equally ignorant, if you ask me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, you're right, absolutely. However, it's just... I dunno... a feeling of "does it HAVE to be"? As I can relate to the sense of taking care, being aware and being careful, it's the other side of the coin that chafes me; the sense of bringing up people to be "rapists" or whatnot. Most men aren't, many men even feel disgusted having to be labeled like that. It just seems like the next "evolutionary" step would be to rid of the catch 22 of "predator-prey"-mentality amongst human beings. Obviously it's a pipe dream of sorts, but still. Can't help myself, think about that rather often. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, sure, but that turns the worry into a self-fulfilling prophecy in the long run, teaching this. I realize that nobody's above worrying, it just strikes me as a rather strange basic premise -- often portraid as specificly being a father's worry. (Also, it paints men to come across rather wonky, which I'm not overly comfortable with). Nothing that's going to change, I'm guessing, it's just strange to see this propelled when it probably isn't the healthiest image to keep alive. Just a thought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last summer I allowed [my beard to grow](http://subject7778.se/2012/07/29/skaggprojektet/). Well, I guess beard is an exaggeration, I've got two--what I called--"tazzles" on my chin. It was only a four week holiday, and I'm kind of curious just how long it could get, if I let it be. Of course, my boss isn't too thrilled about a long term project like that, and I admit that it's kind of a relief even, to have that excuse. Because it wasn't all that easy sporting it, to be honest. (I'm currently considering doing it again this summer, but haven't decided.)

The biggest problem was that people were too polite to mention it. Some you could tell noticed it (you know, looked all over and around my face, just not THERE). I was prepared for snide remarks--anger even--but had no strategy for polite silence. Taught me to speak up to people I meet, and notice something about them. It's a relief to remove the elephant from the room, so to speak.

It was a really interesting experience, all in all, and if possible you should give it a go at some point in your life. </TEXT>
