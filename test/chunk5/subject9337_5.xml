	<TEXT> I try to push back my last meal of the day as close to bedtime as possible, and try to save as much calories for this meal as possible.  Sometimes I take a couple Benedril but be careful with that because it will dehydrate you and overtime you'll develop a tolerance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been twice.  Both times were pretty much against my will in that I was getting extreme pressure from family to recover, so I went even though I was not in the right mindset.  I was also on 24 watch which means someone was literally watching me all the time.  This depends on your case mostly it didn't happen to everyone, but if they think you need it they will watch you.  They know all the tricks and will try to stop you from doing any weird food habits.  You're allowed to say you don't like types of food but they will encourage you and sometimes force you to eat it anyway.  One time at dinner there was a girl who physically couldn't keep down her food after she ate it.  They followed her into the bathroom, watched her purge it up, and they made her eat another dinner.  We really could not get away with anything.  In my particular treatment program we were not allowed to talk numbers (weight, calories, etc.)  Other than that we were encouraged to talk about our feelings a lot, and yeah...art, yoga and things like that.  If you had good behavior you would eventually get special privileges like going on outings and being able to exercise.  They also weighed us everyday but wouldn't tell us the number. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't binge and purge very much but I did tonight and I feel awful.  My chest and throat hurt and my head aches.  I can't even believe the amount that came out.  I didn't realize the binge was that bad, and I probably didn't even get all of it.  I was so stressed already and that's probably what triggered it but now I just feel worse :')  I'm going to try not to punish myself tomorrow and just cook some healthy foods.  Hope you feel better soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [weee...](http://imgur.com/s842k9y) I'm a week binge free today.  It involved eating at maintenance several days of the week but it's the first time in a long time I've allowed myself to go over 1200 without binging so I am feeling hopeful. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I gotta be honest, I live with my boyfriend and his family on occasion (we are very long distance) and his dad loves to cook and feed us and it's HARD.  Mostly because it's so hard for me to say no.  I don't want to seem ungrateful.  My boyfriend has no problem saying no to him and usually only eats very late at night for whatever reason.  I usually try to follow suit but I feel so guilty if his dad cooks and I don't sit down to dinner.  I faked being sick a few times but that only works for so long.  All I can say is try to be assertive and hope they're not people who don't get pissy if you don't eat a ton because they cook. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know...I know a lot of overweight and even obese people who seem like they have their lives so much more together than mine.  They seem active and happy and a lot of them are great parents juggling motherhood plus school or a job.  Yeah they overeat, but I feel like they would be more useful on this world than I would.  I don't know, it's so hard for me to judge anyone about anything when I hate myself so much I guess.  Sometimes I feel like "putting the fork down" is the only thing I can do.

edited to say not downvoting you, just an alternate opinion :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I really disagree with yelling at someone that they don't have an ED based on seeing that they have a higher BMI.  Unless they outright say, "I'm just here just drop 20 pounds as quick as possible for x event!" I try to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I definitely was not underweight when my ED began.  :\ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom has dieted my entire life.  From a very young age I remember her always freaking out about food and eating it anyway.  To this day she "hides" binge food from herself and eats it at night when she thinks everyone is sleeping.  I would feel sorry for her but I hate her because she laughed in my face when I finally confided in her that I was being sexually abused for years.  I hope I never become her, in any way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom had friends over and cooked a huge dinner and I just straight up said "no thanks" and am spending the evening in my room doing schoolwork.  Sometimes you gotta stop worrying about other people's feelings so much and just say no.  It's definitely something I've struggled with.  I've basically lost any weight I put on last week.  I didn't weigh myself until today but back to flair weight and back on track yeeeeeaaaa </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So far so good.  I am pretty hungry because last week my boyfriend was here and there was pizza, beer, candy and ice cream and when I let myself eat those things, I crave more of them like crazy.  I am keeping myself full with lots of chicken and veggies. :)  Going to the gym everyday this week as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care if people wanna be fat and love themselves but the misinformation out there is staggering and frustrating.  I'm sick to death of being told I'm "lucky because I have a fast metabolism" and I will actually launch into a rant at anyone to says this to me anymore.  Also the blaming of hormones imbalances and related diseases... I have a tumor on my pituitary gland that fucks with my hormones.  I'm just sick of the excuses.  If you're fat then own it.  I respect that.  My boyfriend smokes a pack a day and is under no delusions.  He's just mentally not ready to quit.  Some fat people are not in the right mentality to lose weight.  Probably most of us here are not in the mentality to gain weight.  I see just as much or MORE mean comments about a picture of someone who is too skinny than someone who is overweight.  We are not allowed to flaunt it in most places but they are because "body-positivity"  Whatever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just dropped my boyfriend off at the airport; had a whole week of eating "normally."  We went out to eat everyday, and no gym because I wanted to spend literally every minute I could with him.  Food affects my mood way too much.  I really wish I wasn't like this.  Anyway time to get back on track... </TEXT>
