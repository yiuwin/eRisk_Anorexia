	<TEXT> Well I understand that its early access but I feel like when you're in early access for several years and end up at this point where there is actually far less content in the game than there was 3 years ago; I think that's an issue.  I mean it should really only take like 3 years from start to finish to develop a game. And indie game such as this that doesn't even require like cut scenes or a crazy 4 hour long soundtrack and that is a simple physics based game shouldn't take 5 years to complete. It shouldve taken a year to implement full online (which is what they're doing rn and I commend them) but they keep showing off all of this new cool stuff and versions for consoles when their base game is pretty bare and boring compared to what it used to be.       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just think they need to prioritize here. They've taken out the majority of features so they could upgrade to Unity 5 but they have yet to add most of it back in. Now they are trying to develop a PS4 and Xbone version. Seems a bit fucked up to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as I wanna disagree with you I really dont know if I can. Rockstar announcing anything big at E3 has never really been their thing anyways so I feel like that whole story about them not showing it at E3 because of the Orlando shooting or whatever is a miscommunication or misunderstanding that is being spread around. I will admit that the twitter account favoriting the tweet about red dead redemption is a bit weird but that could also be their social media person screwing with people. Rockstar has always been known to announce titles independently and I dont see them announcing something at a conference just because they "owe" a company something.  But thats just what im thinking </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems to be going VERY slow. They keep promising to add features and certain maps and stuff and they end up never putting them out on time. They said they were planning to release private servers and more customization for players in August.... Its the end of august and its not here. If they need to hire more people they should do so but at this rate they will never get a quality game with multiplayer out there. Especially considering they keep taking maps and features out to update them but just never end up putting them back in. This is all coming from a very frustrated fan </TEXT>

GoalkeeperJoe Bendikhad another stellar night and looked like he had earned his team a pointuntil substitute Jozy Altidores 86th-minute winner. He made five outstanding saves, including astunner at point-blank range to deny Altidore, but he was still not happy with his evening.

To be honest, I get sick of it, he insisted. I would rather stand there and not make a singlesave. If I need to make saves, I will make saves, but I would rather win. It is a bit of consolationto play well against a good team like that. They are one of the best teams in the league by far.But we need to regroup and get three points against New York. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Now a lot of you probably read that title and said immediately "yes!" Because a college degree now is like considered to be the equivalent of a high school diploma over 25 years ago. But I sit in my college general education class listening to my professor rant about random shit and think "is this really worth $4000? Yo listen to this guy rant about stuff that doesn't even pertain to my subject that I want to learn?" I genuinely feel like modern college is just like grown up high school. For the most part you aren't really learning stuff that you want to learn. Its just another hoop you have to get through. A very expensive hoop that is. So I ask. Why not just save the massive debt build up and 4 years of my life and just like go to private classes and certification classes for IT since that's my field I wanna work in. Wouldn't that be better/easier? Now you may say "well how do you expect to get looked at if you don't even have a college degree?" Now what I say back to that is that I won't need to deal with that. I'll be good enough at my job so that it doesn't matter. I'll have 8x the experience as that fresh put of college kid that most IT companies run into. That's what will set me apart. I'll have started at a little internship. Slowly making connections. Slowly building up until I reach a point where I start getting decent money because I've learnt so much and was able to acquire an actual IT job in two years. Now keep in mind if I was in a university I would be just now finishing up my general education courses and prerequisite courses for IT. So now when I apply for that sweet $80,000 IT job they look at my resume and see where it says "2 years of professional experience" and shows a nice list of companies and people as the college graduate just has a cool little degree. No tests to prove he knows how to apply what he's learned in the real world. No experience. Who do you think they'll choose? Idk I just don't know how I feel about college. I need help.I see it as pointless and almost handicapping yourself before you even start life. It just seems like their are so many more productive ways that same time and money could be invested. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About what? the scores? I mean quitting the corps isnt going to change that. Most of it was the program itself. Not the ability of the corps.


EDIT: sorry for sounding defensive. Ive been working my ass off to get my chance to march with the cadets drumline under mcnutts direction and obviously McNutt leaving would kinda shit on that parade. Especially if he resigns and doesn't move to another corps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest. I only want online so I can play friends and be able to watch our simulation of our battle together. I wouldnt mind if there wasnt actual like multiplayer but instead like a "Go head to head with friends" where you can have up to 4 friends play together. Thatd be really cool </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yikes I thought this show was in good hands but that poster alone makes me very unsure already. Marching gloves playing snare? With concert sticks? Without a ploom? This is scaring me. Why couldn't they just take a high quality picture of one of the actual drumlines in the show? Unless its not just about cadets and bluedevils anymore which is what it kinda sounds like. "Clash of the corps" almost sounds like its talking about the entire activity as opposed to just 2 groups and also that uniform isn't even close to any uniform from a drum corps so lol </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Issue with backroom team lead. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-10 07:49:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've worked at target for about 5 weeks as flow team and a little bit of FDC. I kinda enjoyed flow team. Everyone was super chill. Nobody was super hard on you for not knowing things and they helped you through it. Now I've seen the backroom people around a bit and they all seem super chill, I even talked to one of them for a little bit when I first started on backroom and he was really cool. Today(my first real day of backroom), I was taught by a lady. She kinda seemed like she had an attitude from the get go. She told me to push two carts of grocery so I start pushing. I get through my first cart in about 10 mins. Now get in mind I'm from flow so I'm not used to scanning and finding everything and then having to do stuff insanely quickly. So I'm about 15-20 mins into my second cart and she comes up to says "you're supposed to have this done already what's taking so long? This should've taken 20 mins and its already been 1 hour." She bitched me out pretty much and kept doing stuff like that the entire day. I kept getting rude remarks and sighs from her even when I was working my ass off. She's making me not want to work there anymore. I actually liked the job until now. I work with her again tomorrow and Friday and sunday and I wanna quit just so I don't have to deal with her. I need advice about what to do. I'm sitting up honestly feeling like shit even thinking about having to work with her tomorrow. I don't get paid enough to deal with a person with her attitude. I just feel so isolated and I feel so alone now and feel like she just would rather me not even be there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think their new ending would have a lot more of an impact if right before they killed the statue, they rolled the prop with him on it to the front and center. That way all eyes are on it. I didn't even realize they were killing him because his prop is on the thirty and in the middle of the field. If everybody was watching the prop at the end and then they killed the statue right before hiting that new phtase after they go quiet people would go nuts. </TEXT>
