	<TEXT> Call me crazy; I honest to God believe sometimes it's scripted, both to your advantage or the other team's. Like the game is programmed to adjust the probability of shots going in.

I just played a game where the opposing team shot 76% from the field, almost all of the shots were contested. A lot of my passes were tipped. Sometimes the simplest of passes would result in turnovers.

Other times though, it's in your favor. You know, when Durant misses 5 wide open mids in a row and you make every shot you take, open or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't spend points on Gold packs. I never do that and I'm perfectly content.

What you wanna do is get the 3 stars against the all star team and test your luck. I get D Rose pretty often with it. After you get 3 stars, start another game up and quit as soon as you are able to to reset the stars for that specific team. Rinse and repeat until you get the players you want. The only thing you will spend MyTeam points on during this process is contracts if you have none left, and they're pretty cheap.

You can get every player on your list with this method, except Wilt. I'm not sure about Curry. For him, do this with the Warriors instead.

For Wilt, shell out the MT points for that random historic pack. It's a shame they didn't extend the packs individually as they promised and made it random. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently 2K decided to recently change the difficulty of domination. I play the all star team all the time. I used to be able to hold them to 10 points a quarter, no problem. Now, they can score 30 points on me, at will. All they do is chuck an alley oop. It doesn't help that I miss most of my wide open 3s

How do you play defense? What points of emphasis do you use? What zone?

I'm extremely frustrated at the moment lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 18, student. It's been over three weeks I'm on vacation, still have one more week to go.

Before the vacation, there was a girl who I thought liked me, so I went ahead and asked for her number so we could do something together between semesters.

I texted her, about two days before Christmas. We talked for a bit, and I told her w'd do something after Christmas.

This whole vacation, I've been feeling lazy. Not in a bad, depressing way. I just wanna stay in and enjoy some video games I couldn't play during the semester due to school work. Either that or kick back with some guy friends. I'm not sad by any means. I'm generally a happy guy who can easily make people smile.

I haven't contacted her since. I talked to my sister about it. She told me girls in general expect a guy to keep his word.

It's not that I'm nervous, I just don't feel like putting any effort in right now. I don't wanna be on her bad side though. I don't care if I get rejected. </TEXT>

I follow Lefty on Twitter. I don't know why. He's fucking cruel. Sometimes it's justified, while other times the guy on the other end did nothing wrong. Why?

A week or two ago, there was a photo posted here in regards to Ryan that said: "Confidence is silent, insecurities are loud." It was another Ryan hate thread, but the exact same thing can apply to the hosts. They're incredibly insecure. They talk way more about hate than the nice things they get from fans. </TEXT>

How can I reestablish his sleep schedule? If we put him in the cage, he'll just start crying. The cage is in the living room, where we will be sitting watching TV.

He's a Cavalier King Charles, if it matters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you sure you didn't buy a gold pack some time before and got hit with the server issues right after? The pack would open up next time you go in MyTeam.

If not, go ham. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I try to aim on average 20 points a quarter, so I had over 80 points by the end, and we won. I also make sure I have at least 4 players with 10+ points, with one over 20. I don't know what I did wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is they recently changed it so that blocks aren't as valuable as they were a week ago.

I used to get 3 stars all the time with a bronze lineup and lots of blocks and steals. Now I just suck altogether.

For example, I just won a game with 14 blocks. I got 5500 MT, I need 6000 for 3 stars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A week ago, I could take open jumpshots and they would go in 90% of the time as long as the shooter is good at that range.

Now, I have to pray that they go in. I'm literally shooting 30% on open 3s with Kyle Korver. It's ridiculous. It's very hard to get 3 stars now. Apparently they changed it so that blocks don't count as much. But did they change the difficulty as well, or maybe game style? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't know how to put it, but you did perfectly. But I also think the hosts are a factor as well. How many PKAs in a row has it been where Woody goes on about wanting a picture of Wings' balls. The man says no, it's no... New topic. </TEXT>
