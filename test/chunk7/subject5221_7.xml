	<TEXT> So in the new video for dark necessities there are some scenes with the band on a couch which i'd wish to post as my Facebook cover. I'm on a phone so i can't really catch a quality shot of that. Could anyone help me and share it with us? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a HTC One M7 as well as a Samsung Galaxy J5 on which I did this procedure... The HTC didn't have any problems so the CyanogenMod Rom only made it look different but the Galaxy J5, which had enormous lag and flash storage problems before turning to CyanogenMod, has been revived by this procedure and was working better than when I had it new... One small problem I noticed is that even with the CyanogenMod Rom it gets kind of slowish after about two months of use... But backing up data and the doing a factory reset fixed it for another 2 to 3 months of use. </TEXT>
