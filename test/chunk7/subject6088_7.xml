	<TEXT> I don't know if you read through the other comments but yeah I experienced 9 out of 11 runs of 3-crate shipments that were loose shipments. Only two were in one truck or van. 

It's definitely fishy when bouncing between two warehouses. 

I didn't calculate the percentage of these in my experiment at all. I just tallied all the runs and did an average time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's no question that 3crates is better Dollar/minute.

But if you look at the increase in investment versus the return, it's definitely not proportional.

I mean if you had to pay $400,000+ to save an hour or just do it for an additional hour, would you pay? That's the question.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't get me wrong. I'm not arguing against buffing the Rhino. From what I hear (I haven't driven it much lately) it seems way too weak. 

In my opinion, back when people were screaming about tank griefers, all R* had to do was give it a 6-minute cool down to call another Rhino if you lost yours. That would have solved the griefing. Because it was defeatable (about as much as you would expect a foot soldier versus a tank) but when you did defeat it, the griefer just got into another right away. That was the most annoying part. A cooldown would have fixed that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a good point. No I didn't factor this in mainly because I just kept flying back and forth between the two warehouses non-stop. It didn't even occur to me. 

Cooldown is a whole other issue we'd need to discuss. Obviously there's a whole lot less cool down if you're doing 37 versus 111. But if you're casually filling these warehouses and making money in other ways in between, it might not matter *as* much (?) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Crate Retrieval Experiment Data </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-01 18:25:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's a well known fact that the $18,000 triple crate delivery is a better dollar/minute investment and the $2000 single crate 

gives better monetary ROI.

But it made me wonder if the 18:2 ratio is actually fair or if it's some other forumula.

So I did a test to compare the single crate deliveries versus the triple crate delivery and timed them to compare true investment 

costs that include money as well as time.

Here are my findings:

RULES:

* Started the timer from hitting the "confirm" button at the Securoserv computer at my office.

* Stopped timer after I turned in the last cargo and then went back outside. I would stop the timer once the game loaded me back 

outside.

* I worked out of two warehouses. One was Convenience Store Lockup (Small, in Rancho) and the other was Wholesale Furniture (Large, Cypress Flats.) I alternated between the two lockups in order to mitigate too much bias from one remote location. THIS IS WHERE YOU MIGHT GET THE MOST VARIATION IN YOUR RESULTS due to location differences. But I feel like Rockstar probably makes most missions roughly the same distance from your warehouse, no matter where your warehouse is situated.

* For consistency's sake, every time I left the CEO Office (I have Maze Tower) I would go to elevator and leave using Pegasus 

Buzzard. (Yes, that's $500 a pop. This experiment cost me like $10k lol)

* I always started the mission with full health. (I would get green juice upon returning to my office, before sourcing a new crate 

mission.)

* If I died, I still logged the time (seen below) but I did not average those times into the findings.

Here are the results:

***Single Crate Missions***

Time range: 3:00-5:55 (10 runs)

Total minutes: 40:38

Average mission: 4:04

Median: 3:31

***Triple Crate Missions***

Time range: 6:09-16:48 (11 runs but I died in two missions, so I only averaged the 9 perfect missions)

Total minutes: 94:59 (not including two missions where I died)

Average mission: 10:33

Median: 9:55

**FINDINGS**

What I've discovered is that, if your average triple-crate mission takes 10:33 minutes to do, then you can fill a large warehouse in 37 trips or 6:30:21.

Doing single-crates, you can fill a large warehouse in 7:31:12.

So the time difference is about a 17% increase to do single over triple, but the financial investment difference is 300% ($666,000 for large, $222,000 for small)

So what do you guys think? Which is worth it to you? Assuming my data approximates your experiences, is single or triple (or doubles?) the better option?

	<TEXT> CCO III can be finished in 2:30. But yeah if you're waiting 15-minutes anyway, Potshot is good. I use CCOIII because I go AFK while doing other things around the house. Then come back for 2 minutes, finish it, then setup another, then go back to doing something else. 

You can get 40k PER MISSION for 2-minutes work, at 15-minutes wait. 

Edit:

If you're referring to doing Potshot three times to get 50k, then you can do CCOIII three times for $60k. And there's no special tricks or anything complicated about it. You just get a Buzzard and kill everyone. It takes 2-3 minutes, tops.  </TEXT>

Total $6,450,000

So my answer right now is crates :-)

	<TEXT> There was a stretch were there were RP exploits in contact missions as well as Creator Races and missions. 

I remember taking Anna from the hotel in Clearing the Cathouse and hovering sober the yellow circle at Madrazo's house and taking in the RP to the tune of like 1000RP/sec. it would just *brrrrrrrt!* 200RP at a time while you hovered your chopper over the objective point. 

I also remember a mission at Fort Zancudo where you parked a Buzzard, rubber banded your controller and just kept homing-missile the infinite soldiers that would come toward you. This one was slower but you could run it AFK for hours. 

I did these exploits to jump from ~100 to 120 when I got my mini gun. After that RP didn't mean anything to me. (Over the course of this 2xp event, I jumped over 40 levels starting at 405! That's juts normal playing and a few days when I cranked on playlists.)

I think this guy's RP is totally doable. And his racing stat, if you created your own races and were farming RP while AFK, you could get these race numbers too. 

It's not "normal" gameplay, but I don't think it's hacking or modding.

	<TEXT> Well I didn't mean literally LSConnection just add more bad guys. I just meant imagine a mission like that (multiple objectives and locations in one job, etc) but with the idea that only high level players could access them and they were all very high difficulty level.

But to your point, knowing this method actually helps you make a challenging alternative. What if, for example, merryweather guards were stationed throughout the airstrip and would come after you if you sniped? Maybe you have to use stealth to take them out first. What if entering the airport triggered four stars (like in single player)? What it the bad guys in the hangar had sniper rifles too like in the satellite dish mission, but not idiots like those guys. 

There are a lot of alternatives to making cool high difficulty missions.

As far as people not dying and killing you, super fast, I can't know exactly what's happening but CEOs can drop BST (bull shark testosterone) and get double damage and defense for a limited time. 

If you can't shoot your gun, it could be a controller issue. When I started playing GTA again -- about two months ago -- I got on and started a session with some friends and i couldn't fire my gun. I could drive but not shoot with R2. R2 worked in other games. Super weird. Googled it, turns out it's a weird bug with worn out controllers in GTA. I bought a new controller and it works fine. 

Sorry it's so frustrating but it's really not that bad. If you keep to yourself or play with friends, GTA on PS4 is actually very peaceful (relatively) and hacker-free. 

Also, read up on switching your MTU to play in a public lobby but isolated and completely solo. Good luck bro.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meanwhile, while you wait for approval, you can go to PS4 menu settings  connect to Internet  custom

Then select the default settings for each option until you see MTU settings. For that one, select "custom"

Delete the number that's there and enter 900 or 800 (I use 900 but either is fine) and finish the setup. You can let the PS4 test the connection but it's not necessary. 

The go back to GTA and start a new public session. You will spawn into a public session but all by yourself. Eventually, some other players might join, but at 900 MTU it takes me like six or seven hours before I see that happen, if at all. 

Happy gaming </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well you get two delivery options. A local and a remote. The local one gets you less money and the remote one gets you more. 

If you're in Blaine County, the remote location is in LS. if you're in LS, the remote is Blaine County somewhere  

So location does matter in the sense of not having to travel *AS far* for remote deliveries... the cheaper ones (farther ones) are gonna suck more in the long run. 

My Clubhouse is sort of mid-state in Blaine County. Just at the foothills.

I wouldn't say it was pointless to consider the pricier ones in "prime" locations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you timed it out?

Have I "timed it out?" Do you mean have I timed it? No I haven't. If you told me a week is longer than a day, I wouldn't need to time that either. It's just known.

Crate missions take anywhere from 5-12 minutes. The ones with three separate crates are more like 8-12 minutes. this is known by [people who have done the research](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/5go1nt/offices_warehouses_crate_missions_ceo_faq_guide/datpu2t/) and by pretty much anyone who has played the game.

If somehow you get super lucky and three crates fall really near your warehouse and you manage to finish the mission in HALF of the average time -- let's say you do it in 4-minutes -- I still don't know how it can take longer than 4-minutes to find a new lobby. If that's your situation, then I feel bad for you. Like I said, YMMV. But my lobbies usually load up in 60-90 seconds, on the long side.

I don't know what's up with your connection, but for the vast majority of players, finding a new session (and a new set of 3-crate missions) is much faster than completing the mission. So if we KNOW it's going to be three loose crates, it's preferable to just find a new session. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA: $18,000 crate missions </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm tying to load up a full large warehouse for the second time before the 25% bonus ends in a couple days. 

Some of you might also be trying to load crates. 

If you get a crate mission with THREE separate objectives, right off the at (you see three small circles at the bottom right of the screen when you get up from your Securoserve computer) you can *abort the mission and not lose money* by disconnecting your internet. Obviously, disconnect immediately. Don't leave your office or do anything, really. 

I usually just go to my PS4 settings and "test internet connection" but I'm sure you can start YouTube app or pull the LAN or whatever you prefer. 

When you restart a lobby, your money is back up to before you dropped $18,000. 

Happy sourcing! </TEXT>

Reasons why you're an idiot:

1) A safe costs $335,000. Not "millions". Not even one million. Not even half a million. 

2) you literally said "the money vault allows you to store money in it without keeping it in the bank or on your person" which is completely erroneous. And you state it like an authority. 

3) Lastly, if I have $60,000,000 and I spend HALF A PERCENT of my money on "a decoration" that's not being idiotic. To think so is idiotic. 

I looked up the definition of idiotic, like you suggested. "A foolish or stupid person"

You still fit the bill.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you really want low effort, medium pay, I think Fleeca Heist or sourcing and selling Sandkings will fit the bill. 

Sandkings are a 100% spawn if you use a time locked mission and go to the right spot to watch it magically spawn in. 

You can source six of them in about 7-minutes (I know this from filling up the 6-car garage in Harmony between 9am and 5p, in game)

They sell for $18,010 each (averaged between blue and yellow versions) and if you sell one every 48 minutes, play for three or four hours a day, you're looking at ~$450,000 a week just in between race lobbies or whatever.

If he warehouse is designed to give you vehicles you don't already have, then fill the warehouse with low and mid range cars so that every time you source a car, the computer gives you a high end car.

	<TEXT> I was going to say this too.

The fact that something as simple as storing a car in a garage or selling a car at the LSC has ballooned into a massive glitching community with exclusive car duping YouTube channels and probably a whole new dedicated bug-squashing division at Rockstar tells me they thought about the hundreds of millions of dollars that people were supposed to be able to legitimately earn through online stock market and just looked at each other during a design meeting and collectively said, "fuck it." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. 1, 2, and 3 cost incrementally more. 

Which means, at the extremes, you can fill the crate one at a time (and only SPEND $84,000 to fill it,) or three at a time (and SPEND $252,000) to fill it.

If you spend $84,000, you will EARN $651,000 for your delivery of a full warehouse. 

If you spend $252,000, you will EARN $483,000 for your delivery of a full warehouse.

However, you only need to make 14 crate sourcing missions to earn $483,000. And to earn $651,000, you need to do 42 sourcing missions.

That breaks down to $34,500 per mission (for 14 missions) and $15,500 per mission (for 42 missions.

So depending on whether you want more money OVERALL or more money for your time, you need to take his into consideration. 

And of course, the 2-crate missions fall somewhere in between.  </TEXT>

I honked at him over and over to move but he just kept snapping away. Eventually after revving the engine and honking the horn, he slowly walked out of the way. But he muttered something under his breath as he was walking past me that I couldn't make out. 

I literally said out loud, in my living room, "wtf did you just say to me?" Hahah

I got out of my car, walked behind him and threw right cross that laid him out. I took $28 dollars off him and drove in and delivered the car. 

That was such a satisfying, immersive moment for me. Hahah </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's actually not THAT bad. I started with coke. Then tried my hand at a meth lab which is cool too (since I'm a huge Breaking Bad fan, it was extra fun to see the lab.)

I then read that the fastest ROI of initial costs is an un-upgraded weed farm. Because it doesn't cost that much to start and nets enough to pay for itself pretty quickly. So I bought a weed farm. Then the discounts for upgrades came on 4/20 so I got the upgrades anyway. 

In all, I have three businesses and just the other day I solo'ed two full shipments (meth and weed I think) and got like $600k total. 

So while you're right that coke is far and away the best investment, 'diversifying your portfolio' is actually not as painful as some redditors make it seem.  </TEXT>

To each their own!

(I reiterate that you can make a million dollars in about three hours of play right now. So upgrading to the office garage is just a matter of a couple of play sessions. In terms of time, this is the best time to do it if you're planning on doing it at all. Barring any huge office garage sales that might be coming soon.) </TEXT>

I said this (almost verbatim!) in a reply above somewhere. So I'll concede this.

If you buy it's definitely more worthwhile (as far as time and effort goes.)

But if you spend something like $75,000, $45,000, $75,000 for a full product shipment of weed (which the game makes you do, sometimes. Not sure why it's really inconsistent...) you're only netting $57,000 on a  $252,000 remote sale. And if that happens to be four Western Baggers, you're gonna have a bad time.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Lots of people say MC businesses are worth your investment because they're "passive income" and they'll earn money while you wait. 

"Passive income" is a misnomer. 

Basically, in order to make money in any recent DLCs in GTA, you have to follow this formula:

SourceMission + DeliveryMission = money

Some missions require a cooldown *after delivery* and before sourcing (crates and cars), some missions require a cooldown *after sourcing* and before delivery (MC biz) -- either way, it's the same formula and it isn't "passive income"

In both scenarios, you can do other money-making activities while you wait. 

Just wanted to get that off my chest.  </TEXT>
