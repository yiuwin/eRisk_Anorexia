All the bowing now makes sense. As if to test whether you're worthy enough to progress ahead or no. What a badass mechanic.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally for me its been Dark Souls 3. Yes it wasn't as good as 1 or bloodborne. But it was great nonetheless. A perfect culmination to one of the greatest game series ever. I don't own the game. But have played it on a friends playstation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey! Merry Christmas! Thank you for being so kind with the giveaway.

So the game i'm dying to get my hands on is Dark Souls 3. I've put several hours into Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2 : Scholar of the first sin. I absolutely love the franchise and have enjoyed every second of Dark Souls I've ever played. Things I love about the game are the lore, the combat, the mechanics. Everything has a depth to it. Which i personally really love. As for why I can't buy it is that I'm currently an engineering student and here in my country games are way too costly. Even if I want to buy a game I have to save for months to be able to buy it. Also asking parents to buy me games is out of the question because here playing games is frowned upon.

I haven't received nor gifted anyone games yet. I wanted to giveaway a game today but all those i wanted to gift were region locked.

Anyways I really want to play Dark Souls 3. 

Currently its 50 percent off on Steam : http://store.steampowered.com/app/374320/

Here is my steam ID : http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198299619543/

Thanks a lot OP.

	<TEXT> There's a bonfire just before the boss. Its kinda hidden. Take a right from the last set of pools. You'll find a statue. Use a fragrant branch of yore to access the bonfire. From here there are like just 2 statues before the boss. Also you can summon Luciatel for help. 

For the boss try to be in the middle of the arena where you are safe from the fire pools. Also dodging his attacks is pretty easy. So make sure you are not carrying too much weight. And use your highest upgraded weapon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The bosses. I mean there are so many. Out of them hardly 3 to 4 are memorable. Also half of them are too easy. The game just looses its ability to give you a sense of achievement sometimes.  </TEXT>
