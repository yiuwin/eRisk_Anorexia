	<TEXT> I need to get back into the gym. But I'm also currently working on recovering from an eating disorder. I really, really miss not being able to work out. It has such healing power. I jut know right now I'm not in a head space where I could get into too heavy of an exercise routine without risking my eating disorder flaring up again. :/ Sucks but right now, healing and recovery in all aspects are number one priority. Hoping to get back into snowboarding this season though. Looking forward to that. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know in my area a lot of the time meetings have kids rooms for people in that exact position. Or there are people with toddlers who will just bring them into the meeting with them. They also sometimes have morning meetings. I would say it's definitely worth at least looking into. Even if you can only go once, if you go to that one meeting and introduce yourself as a newcomer they'll typically give you a phone number list of people there who are willing to support anyone in recovery. So even if you can't necessarily make it to a lot of meetings consistently, you could get to know some people living the clean life and get some numbers you can call when you're struggling. I can't recommend doing everything you can to get there at least once enough.

And you definitely can do this. Stay strong. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From my experience, the physical wds will drop off significantly after day 5 or 6. Not going to lie, the mental/emotional part is there a while longer. But after about 2 weeks things get soooo much easier. Have you thought of going to an NA meeting? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really struggling. I don't know why. Waking up with crazy anxiety the past few days. It's day 13 for me. I don't know why but things are getting harder. It's becoming more and more of a fight to make it through the day (not to mention the nights) without picking up. But. At the same time, I'm still here and I'm still alive to fight another day. Peace and love to everyone out there struggling right along with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know I'm late for this, but I need to check in. I'm struggling tonight. I don't even have a legitimate reason for it which just makes me angry at myself. Woke up with anxiety, getting worse and worse as the night goes on. I don't know why my head is in such a rough place right now. But I'm having a harder time not picking up right now than I can remember having before. I'm really, really struggling. </TEXT>
