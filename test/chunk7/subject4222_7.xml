	<TEXT> Really?! Your worth is calculated by what you do for society? Please don't have children. They won't be worth anything to you till they can work. No telling how you would treat them. Poor babies. 

Thank you for this insight into your mind. I can not argue a valid point with someone who doesn't see the life of a child important cause they give nothing back to society.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A bean! If that bean is alive it is murder. What part of murder do you not understand? Is high time woman starts being held responsible for their actions. Note I believe in abortion to a certain point and in emergency cases, and in rape. But I don't believe in it cause of poor life choices. There is consequences for your actions. In the case of woman having unprotected sex has a high chance of pregnancy. Even having protected sex has a small chance of pregnancy. 

Everyone that is pro choice really isn't. These woman chose to kill a child that doesn't get a say in the matter. How is that pro choice, or does the choice of the child not matter? Murder sir is murder. Will it be ok for someone to kill you? Nope. Life of a child is precious far more than the life of an adult. Most people will chose to save a child before they save an adult, so why is it people want to kill children may because they aren't out of the womb yet? Or that the woman just didn't want to have children? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We do as a people have the right to determine if it is ok to kill other people. We already have laws to that affect. If it's ok to kill a child in the womb that has a heart beat and higher brain functions then it should be ok for the parent to kill their child at any age.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When a "fetus" has a heart beat and brain functions then it is most definitely a living child. Now I understand rape, I also wouldn't want  that. I'm talking about within the first few months before higher brain functions and heart beat is ok with me. But after that fact it is murder.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you. People need to realize that your state, and county may have laws you don't know of or understand. So before you get on your high horse about this just know that if you are going to sell anything in America the government (small or large) wants its cut. So do your research before hand and save yourself some trouble.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So parents want schools to stop kids from bullying other children. That's not going to happen. If kids are physically bullying kids then that is a problem, but name calling is just words. Hell I was bullied all my school days except the my senior year. I was a fat freckled redheaded kid with a whiney voice. Hell one time a guy in high school slapped both of my ears (opened palmed) at the same time busting my ear drums. I  freaked out and screamed and cried cause I couldn't hear anything anymore. I was picked on for that to. I never thought about suicide nor did bullying truly affect me. The reason why was my parents. They taught me that people that bully are usually from broken homes and are scared that kids won't like them so they do stupid stuff and hurt others. It's not ok for them to do it but it is sad that is the main way they can get attention.  

P.S. I also went to a Christian school and that kid that popped my ear drums lived with his grandma and he had to work off the bill his grandmother had to pay due to his actions.  </TEXT>
