	<TEXT> Hey guys,


I recently got suspended at school for hitting a kid in the head with a garbage bin. 

After being suspended, I had a meeting with the kid and somewhere he mentioned osu. He pronounced it "o-sha". WTF is "OSHA".

So anyway, I was wondering how everyone on here pronounces it.

	<TITLE> Any Japanese card collectors in Australia? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-17 01:07:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey /r/PKMNTCGCollections,


I recently got into collecting Japanese cards, and I am currently looking for two cards from Collection Sun and Collection Moon to complete the two sets, and I was wondering if there were any Aussies that have these two cards?
The cards are: (Sun) 050/060 Gumshoos GX   (Moon) 028/060 Luluna GX.

In exchange for these two cards, I am willing to offer you either one of these cards + PayPal/Local Cash my way: (Collection Moon) 066/060 Super Rare Lillie Full Art Trainer **OR** (Collection Sun) 069/060 Hyper Rare Solgaleo Full art GX.

If you don't want to do PayPal/Local Cash, I am happy for trading for English Sun   Moon boosters or old Japanese (Base set) holos.


Thanks

	<TEXT> I will post photos later tonight, I am at school right now and are posting this on my laptop (and I don't have a phone) so I don't have access to a device capable of taking photos at the moment.

On a separate note, the condition of these cards is Mint/Gem Mint. The cards were sleeved and top-loaded as soon as they where pulled, so the condition is superb.

	<TITLE> [GB] Australian HHKB Group buy - Now with PayPal </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-08 03:47:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi MechMarket,

Welcome to the Australian HHKB group buy :)


Here's how it will work:

1:You send me your order for any HHKB from PFU Fujitsu's website.

2:I place the order with PFU Fujitsu

3:I get order shipped to a shipping proxy in batches of 3 Keyboards, 1 week apart (to make sure that you don't have to pay tax and duty from customs)

4:Proxy receives order and ships to me (in Melbourne)

5:Once I receive order from proxy, I ship via AusPost regular mail **OR** if you you are local, you can pick up from me or I can deliver.

6:You receive your brand new HHKB


How will this work?

I will be ordering directly from PFU Fujitsu and shipping to Australia using http://tenso.com/en,
The keyboards are shipped in batches of 3, which costs roughly 5000 YEN (1666 per person($19.00 AUD)). 
When the boards are in Australia, the AusPost shipping cost is roughly $15-20 Aud bringing the total cost up to $34-39 AUD.

What boards will be available?
The complete selection of boards can be found here: http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/direct/hhkb/


But here's a basic list of what boards will be available and their prices respectively:

HHKB Pro 2 English. Black or White. Blank or Printed caps 24,840 YEN = $290 AUD

HHKB Pro 2 Japan. Black or white. Printed caps 24,840 YEN = $290 AUD

HHKB Pro 2 Type-S English. White. Blank or Printed caps 29,700 YEN = $347 AUD

HHKB Pro 2 Type-S Japan. White. Printed caps 29,700 YEN = $347 AUD

HHKB Pro 2 Bluetooth English. Black. Blank or Printed caps 29,700 YEN = $347 AUD

HHKB Pro 2 Bluetooth Japan. Black. Printed caps 29,700 YEN = $347 AUD


How many spots are available?

There are 9 Spots available (3 Boxes). There is already 1 spot reserved for myself (meaning that 8 spots are still available)


How do I order?
You can send me your order via Geekhack PM's.

Here is how you format your order (copy and paste):

Name:

Email:

Phone (Home or mobile):

Suburb:

What keyboard/s do you want:

Do you want to pick up from me in Kilsyth South (YES/NO):

Payment Method (PayPal or Bank transfer)


Payment Details:
The payment methods that will be accepted are Bank Transfer and PayPal. If you choose PayPal Goods and Services, you will be responsible for paying PayPal fees.

My dad is an accountant, so if I got help from him for finances by letting him help with PayPal invoices, would you be more comfortable joining as a user?

There's nothing I can do about PayPal until I'm 18... So if people wanted to join, they had to use bank transfer which no-one wanted to do. </TEXT>
