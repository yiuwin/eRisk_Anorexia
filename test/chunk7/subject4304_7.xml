	<TEXT> **ingredients**
-
* Bacon lardons/pancetta
* Cherry tomatoes
* Onion
* Pasta
* Cheddar cheese for finishing
* mixed herbs (optional)

**method**

* Cook off the bacon bits and onion in a frying pan. You shouldn't need oil if your pan is nonstick.
* while you are doing this, get the pasta into a pan/pot with some water and bring to the boil. Allow to simmer but stir once in a while so it doesn't stick.
* once the onion has softened, start adding the tomatoes, halved before adding. Once all the tomatoes are in, stir for a bit then allow to simmer while the pasta finishes cooking.
* taste-test the pasta every so often. You want to get it off the heat and drained once it has a slightly nutty texture in your mouth. Drain the pasta, add to the frying pan, and simmer.
* sprinkle some cheese (preferably grated) over the top to finish.
* ???
* Enjoy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I'm in the 4th week of boarding sixth form.

We've had some interesting experiences.

One of my roommates seems to love making spontaneous, unnecessary sex noises whenever he walks in the door. So, one day he does it, and the housemaster is sitting on a bed, just chatting to me and the other guy.

Luckily, our housemaster has a decent sense of humour, and just burst out laughing, and pretty soon we did too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had rather an odd dream where I was fighting in some sort of amphibious assault. It was incredibly surreal, and I woke up vividly remembering charging up the beaches, my men behind me, lobbing a grenade into a bunker and seemingly saving the day. The weird part was that my squad mates were my school buddies. Not many of them made it out alive in this dream. Quite sad really, but after all, it was only a dream. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. They are herbal remedies that have been working for millennia.

Valerian might help you sleep or tea tree might help soothe a burn. Lavender can help a wound close up and heal.

Essential oils are good for the little things. They won't cure cancer or your diabetes though. </TEXT>
