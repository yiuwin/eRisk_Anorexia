	<TEXT> No use for a mouse if you can't see the cursor*; that's why it is important for all functionality to be available via the keyboard and why touch typing is probably the most useful IT skill a blind user can acquire. 

Screenreaders, noted above, let you know where you are, and what you can (and what keys to press!) at all places on the screen, and so make it possible for a user to use their computer completely without needing to see the screen. 

Touchscreen phones are even easier to use without seeing the screen using the built in VoiceOver software mentioned elsewhere. Extremely simple commands like swipe left-to-right to advance to the next onscreen control, swipe right-to-left to go to the previous control etc, make the entire phone system accessible. And the best thing is you can turn the display off on your iPhone, using it just via audio prompts and swiping the screen - much longer battery life as the display is no longer needing power. 

* Note that blind doesn't mean lack of vision, but often even with residual vision, a user will find it difficult to navigate using a small mouse cursor.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Annoying issue I'm having working with polygons. When in component mode and have some faces selected, I'll typically alt+LMB drag to rotate around the model and select further faces. However this has recently started deselecting any currently selected faces, and switching out of component mode. Very frustating! No idea why it's happening, but it occurs across multiple files, some complex, some very simple. 

I'll probably end up deleting my prefs directory but just wondered if anyone else is experiencing this, or knows why it may be occurring. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quick answer would be to try deleting, or renaming, your Maya prefs folder. Likely something in there is screwed up. Should be at "My docs\Maya\2014-x64\prefs" or similar. 

The prefs folder will be recreated when you next run Maya, with a default set of prefs setup for you. You will likely need to tweak it to match the previous setup, but it'll probably be working at least.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd be surprised at the amount of people who come back with "He jogs faster", or "it's a longer distance". Really though, this is at least partly due to leading language when posing the riddle - say "yet it only takes him 1 minute 20 for the last leg" and a lot of the time folks will focus on the "only" and assume the time is different.

	<TEXT> These are good points, and you can definitely save some money this way. 

My current rig is a Q9650, 4GB RAM and a three year old graphic card, so just treating myself to a long term upgrade really.

I agree that an SSD is by no means essential, and can easily be ignored if on a budget. But they are a well worthwhile upgrade for an existing system further down the line. 

With 4GB of RAM in my current system, I've rarely had problems with modelling. I do some messing around with MEL scripting, and this is where I've run into RAM problems more often (some of it undoubtedly to sketchy scripting on my part.

I'm going for the nicest rig I can afford at the moment as I'll not have to upgrade for a good few years again - current rig has some parts 7 years old! - so definitely some savings to be made in cutting the spec down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just in the process of finishing a workstation that I'm putting together for Maya, happy to share what I'm putting together and why. 

**CPU: i7 4770k**

Getting the fastest quadcore I can, and the k suffix models allow for overclocking. 

As rendering is very CPU intensive, you'll want a fast CPU. I was torn by the option of going for the 6 core series (4930 etc), but these are not far off double the price of the quad core series and I found it hard to justify that increase. Also, this is influenced by an add-on card (below), I'm possibly getting. 

I'm getting the Corsair h100i aftermarket cooler to hopefully get a stable overclock of around 4.5GHz. 

Less time waiting for renders to finish = better :-) 

**RAM: 16GB**

Don't think speed of RAM matters overly, more the amount. I'm getting 16GB (2x8GB), with the flexibility to expand to 32GB in the future. The more RAM, the more geometry your scenes can handle. 

There's another side to this though: you should learn to be frugal with geometry to some extent too. Having boat loads of RAM shouldn't mean you go crazy and add in unnecessary levels of geometry into your scenes as this can create further problems! But, having lots of RAM is never a bad thing with 3d modelling.

**Storage**

Same as my existing computer, I'm going for an SSD for OS\apps, and then a RAID 1 setup with x1.5TB drives for storage. I've lost a harddrive full of data before, so now keep a redundant copy of everything. Well worth it considering the price of storage now. You can also get away with some of the online storage lockers I guess, but need to be regimented in backing up your data. 

**Graphics**

Whilst I do some gaming, I've decided to go for a pure workstation card in my new machine. I managed to get a Quadro K2000 for around 200. Having a workstation card** only** helps in the viewport; it doesn't help with rendering! But, if you're working with geometry heavy scenes, a laggy viewport can be very frustrating. That said, there are lots of options in Maya for speeding up viewport performance (disable shading, bounding boxes etc), but I felt like treating myself. 

Depending on what level of stuff you're doing you maybe as well getting a gaming card (esp. if your gaming and working on 3d on the same machine)

I'm also looking at getting a Caustic R2100 ray trace card at some point. This allows for (near) real time ray traced viewport in Maya; this can save loads of time on mental ray renders when fine tuning a model, saving the final render for the CPU, but using the R2100 for intermediate renders. Costs a bit, but sounds very cool. 

A few thoughts for you, feel free to ask any questions though! </TEXT>
