	<TITLE> Should I buy Rainbow6? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi all
I'm a MASSIVE Halo and COD fan. I've played Rainbow six once  YEARS ago and I'm looking for a new FPS to play.

Would you recommend Rainbow6?
What sort of multiplayer modes does it have?
Is it smash mouth killstreaks/scorestreaks/rewards in online?
Is it your standard Team Death match orientated multiplayer?

Thanks all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How are offshore Oil rigs constructed? They seem like such a massive engineering task.

Are they constructed in the sea using multiple ships.. or constructed on land and then moved? Are there large poles holding them up underneath the sea all the way to the sea bed?

Someone kindly explain </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you guys think the best weapon is now post patch, I know it depends on a lot of variables, but since the update what has improved noticeably?

for example, the Vesper going from a Gun you'd never use, to now being your top 2 weapon of choice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tt's due to reptiles receptors having a higher level of heat sensors than pain sensors. The pain receptors are poorly developed because, during evolution, objects hot enough to burn are uncommon in the wild and such receptors therefore aren't needed. One would then lack a burn/pain withdrawal reflex.]
A humans pain receptors are a lot better evolved. We would scream and jump/move around due to that much pain (albeit our adrenaline would try to get us out of there and therefore we may feel less pain) But you get the idea. </TEXT>
