	<TEXT> Why do trolls on reddit make sweeping generalizations about an entire city? Is it because they have an inferior football team who has worshipped a murderer and a woman beater? Is it because they have a sub-par QB that they need to make excuses for?

Or is it because they live in... Baltimore?

Love, A Boston dickhead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, the sweet smell of Ravens fanbase jealousy. 4 Lombardi's and counting; no tears here in NE.

You real football fans in Baltimore know a better team when you see one.

	<TEXT> I think if you picked one animal per day/week/month or whatever timetable you pick, that would be fine. Have that thread always be at the top of this sub and people can click it or not click it. I don't know why people think that would be intrusive or change the point of this sub. When a major corporation sells goods but then also has fundraisers, it doesn't mean they are no longer a corporation selling goods. It is OK to have 99.99% of this page be feel good posts, with a single post always being there if you want to donate.

As long as it's a single link and you don't allow other people to post links for funding, it really isn't a big deal and will save lives.

I don't know about everyone else but seeing before n after pics or anything rescue related always makes me want to donate at that moment. Why not have a convenient place for people who feel the same?

Let's do some good people! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My father is a stats professor and published a book called: Nine Out of Every 5 People Do Not Understand Statistics (Pearson Educational Publishing). He's always making your same complain that "People cite statistics all the time to back up their claims and have no sense for the story behind the numbers."
