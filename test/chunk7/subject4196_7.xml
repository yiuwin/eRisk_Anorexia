	<TEXT> Be as talkative as you like :)
I love hearing what people appreciate about my drawings because what I like and what the viewers like seems to be totally different. 
I'm almost always supprised when something gets popular as I might not like the drawing at all. 
The chopstick/fish as an example is one I personally don't like.
As for the 80's super polished robot, I might do that someday soon.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts :)

	<TEXT> A bit of a late answer but I wanted to get some time with the game, so yes I bought infinite air because I was suspecting that people who dont understand how jumping works on a snowboard hates the controls and yes that is sort of the case.
I have been snowboarding 2/3 of my life and had no problem understanding the controls as they are sort of accurate when it comes to flips and so on. My problem with the game compared to Amped 2 is that there is no real progression, its feels empty, lonely and a little pointless when I play it. I mean I like it and it fills a need but its lacking on the fun factor. Also the constant frame drops, popping in trees and epileptic powder snow doesn't  really help.
I wish the developers would watch Shredbots the movie 20 times in a row and then release a huge patch to the game haha.
Either that or I wish steep would have a baby with infinite air.

	<TEXT> After a frustrating half hour with the game I didn'tt have any problems doing crazy tribble backflip 1440 dubbel nose grabs and crazy stuff like that. However it feels super weird, it feels like the developers have no idea how jumping on a snowboard works and the whole trick system is just horrible. Overall the game just feels unfun as you said. 
It got no soul whatsoever, however I also think SSX is a horrible Snowboard game but that is a discussion we dont need to get into :P </TEXT>

Some people can't hear these kind of high pitched sounds, I am however super sensitiv to it and can even hear my iphone 7 sound in a silent room when the phone is 1 meter away from me. </TEXT>
