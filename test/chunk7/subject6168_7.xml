	<TEXT> This is the best response. Reddit and forum bitching is just a small subset of the players who have difficulties enjoy the game for what it is...a game.

I visit Reddit for some good strategy tips and deck guides. I wish all the complainers would stick to r/clashroyalecirclejerk </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm absolutely loving this deck and my princes are only level 2. I've been using it in tournament for now. I tweaked it a little based on my original comment. I put in furnace instead of EC and ice wiz instead of princess. Furnace costs less and keeps the pressure on 1 side so it requires an answer, much like princess. Ice wiz as we know is a defensive power house. His ability to slow things down helps generate elixir for a counter. I try to drop double Prince as spirits spawn and drop an ice spirit in the mix. Total destruction. I managed to win vs 2 balloon decks with furnace, ice spirit and ice wiz to defend. Give it a shot and tell me what you think compared to your original deck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has a permanent place in my deck. It's seriously a versatile card. Rush of barbs? Log. Hog coming in? Log + something cheap. That valk or mini p coming in at half health and about to take a swipe at your tower? Log. Goblin barrel about to land? Drop that log. 

So many more uses. The most important being a positive elixir trade to princess. My suggestion? Learn to use it now, I'm sure a buff is coming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I run a vastly different deck. I don't believe in the RG cancer.

3M, giant, knight (sub miner), fire spirits, goblins, elixir collector, log, ice wiz (sub princess or bomber).

Basically log is a great combo with ice wiz, princess, knight, bomber, even spirits or gobs. Those units turn to offense, and you get the added benefit of a cheap 2 elixir princess killer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone else feel like they're just currently going through the motions with this game? Opening chests, requesting cards, maintaining trophy level. 

There's been numerous posts about the current state of the game. ChiefPat's video had the most clear points of what SC could do to help the game. So I'm not going to get into those details.

I just wanted to see who else is eagerly awaiting SC's next big update. I'm curious to learn if they've taken anything the community has said into account. In my opinion, the next update is going to make or break this game for a lot of people, myself included. Even simply adding a couple more legendaries might be enough to drive me away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey I had to follow up. I went back to your original 3M deck and it's an absolute wrecking ball. The only adjustment I made was replacing FB with Log that I got yesterday. It makes the deck more flexible on those counters. Sparky is still my biggest problem though. How do you manage it usually? I typically drop giant and hope 2M are far enough not to get obliterated. I have about a 50% win rate against sparky. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I was to guess you're strategy, seems like you hold rocket unless there's something good to counter, 3M, collector, etc. Then you're trying to get the giant to the tower with every push so you can chip away until it's rocketable. You've got variations on your pushes, but giant seems to be the corner stone of it all.

How do you keep RG damage to a minimum? And if you have any legendaries which would you sub in? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sat in legendary for a while then I got bored of the struggle to keep my chests going. I dropped back down to 2500 and now enjoy using random decks that seem fun. People still offer a challenge and I'll rarely lose (unless on purpose to keep trophies low). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm getting close to level 10 as well. I sit in arena 7 by choice. Arena 8 has a lot of hard fought battles and on most days I don't have time to battle 30 times to get my crown chest. Sitting in arena 7 I can get it done much quicker. Yeah I'm missing out on a few cards and gold, but sitting in arena 7 has the added benefit of allowing me to test various decks for fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been flip flopping back and forth between both these variations. They both have their pros and cons. I just wanted to thank you for the original deck idea. I'm having a blast with it and getting away from the meta is my favorite part! The biggest learning curve was being OK with sacrificing a tower in order to build the push. Most wins are 3 crowns.

Thanks again </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spirits and FB together felt a bit redundant. Faster reaction with zap and helps a lot with sparky. The biggest drawback is you can't FB their pump. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your comment gave me an idea. I subbed out giant for sparky. Switched knight for valk and zap for FB(cheapen the deck and counter sparky). Using your general strategy I've been having huge success. Primarily because sparky needs attention when played. Bonus she'll blow up any barbarians dropped on the 2 Musks behind it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually want to play more and more. I have two accounts. After reaching A8, my main just trolls around in lower A7, testing new decks and having fun. I can easily get it back into A8 if I feel like it. But I have the most fun trying different things. My second account is also in A7, I focus on 1 deck that has always worked for me (level 8 account with a couple level 10 commons and 7 rares). I keep my chest slots full and crown completed on both accounts. 

I've stopped playing clash of clans and boom beach because of this game. It requires little effort compared to the others.

I've considered starting a 3rd account so I can battle high level players in lower arenas.

I get enjoyment out of the game by not worrying about legendaries, p2w barriers or trophies. I enjoy it purely for the fun strategy and ease of play. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's an RG cycle deck. It's all about keeping the pressure on. If I see a pump go down I'll be pushing right away. You never let them play how want. I don't want until 10 elixir at the start either. If I have an RG in my hand he's played almost immediately. It either takes them off guard or ruins their set up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 9 zap cannon, 7 hog, 6 for the rest, 1 sparky/IW. That got me into A8. After I got my mini p and wiz to 7 I topped out at 3300. Good players with a miner deck were giving me trouble. Everything else I could compete with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Currently testing this deck to much success: RG, spear gobs, tombstone, fire spirits, minions, mini p, zap and ice wiz (sub in stab gobs or archers). This is a bit of a variation on yarn's RG cycle deck. Some use hog, but I like mini p for the current meta. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're looking for a sparky deck, try this: mini p, hog, wiz, ice wiz, collector, cannon (may change to Tombstone), zap and sparky. Use sparky only on defense, deploy wizard with him on counter. If you have a collector down, you should be able to deploy mini p and hog in the other lane with zap ready. Both pushes require an answer or they'll lose a tower. My experience is the hog mini p does most of the tower killing. Sparky is best for defense and a distraction.

I took this deck to 3300, miner cycle or hog cycle can be difficult, but not impossible. </TEXT>
