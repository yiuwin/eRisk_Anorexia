	<TEXT> I travel a lot and want to still be able to use Photoshop and Word/Excel. That is literally it. I'd like a smaller/lighter computer and as cheap as possible as this is just my road machine. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

EDIT: form below


**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* Screen size preference: N/A

* OS preference (Windows/Mac/Linux): Windows probably

* Gaming requirements (example games and desired fps/settings): N/A

* Other performance requirements (video editing, CAD, etc.): Just run Photoshop without freezing

	<TEXT> Apple SE from '86/'87. I also have the cool old-school dotmatrix printer, unfortunately I can't find any of my floppy disk games except Carmen Sandiego. Does it have any monetary value?

	<TEXT> I'm 5'8" and in the beginning (a year ago) I lost about 12 lbs just from the exercise, but I haven't lost for a few months. It's good to maintain, but I still have flab and I'm not a disciplined eater </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've found that I can eat about 1,900 calories/day based on age weight lifestyle etc. I work out 6x/week burning about 700-800 calories per time. I'm trying to lose about 10 lbs belly fat and tone up (details below), Does this mean I can eat 2,600 calories or do I stick to the 1,900 total? Sorry if this has been asked I can't find a good answer.

Info:
29 M 145lbs workouts 6x/week are 30 min run (3.5 miles) and 30 min walk at 15% incline. Also basketball 1x/week, shooting baskets 3x/week, weights 2-3x/week.

Trying to get more tone and less belly flab

Thanks for any insight </TEXT>
