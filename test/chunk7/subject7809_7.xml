	<TEXT> A rough explanation of gnosis: The final stage is a dramatic awakening, a transformation that produces what they called the fire of gnosis. Here, there is a direct personal experience of God. (However, I would like to add that many see multiple gnostic experiences as not only possible, but necessary)

I have often wondered it, and have had personal experiences that have strengthened my faith. I was wondering what you all think. Has anybody ever tried to practice psychedelic shamanism in the context of a belief tradition? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I signed up for this Saturday's SAT French test (no listening). My confidence in my ability was quickly quelled by taking the practice questions. What are some resources for catching up quickly that are more easily navigated than ABOUT? I especially need help for expanding my vocabulary because I get tripped up on grammar questions I know because my vocab is very lacking.  </TEXT>
