	<TITLE> Problems with my sewing machine while quilting?  </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-11-30 07:59:23 </DATE>

	<TEXT> This is my first quilt. I did all my "stitch in the ditch" sewing fine, but now I'm trying to add some more quilting and my sewing machine is acting up. The tread comes out of the needle CONSTANTLY, and the needle often gets stuck. When I try to sew with just a regular piece of fabric the sewing machine works fine. Any advice would be wonderful, I'm getting very frustrated. 
Thanks! 

edit: it's a singer simple, I'm using new machine quilting thread, the upper tension say it's at a 4, I'm making a tee-shirt quilt with thin batting </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There isn't a cheaper programs, I'm going to a state school for undergrad. There are no state vet schools in my state. Even state schools cost 45-50 grad a year. 
Tuition reimbursement...I will look into that. Thank you </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am currently working at a veterinary clinic as an assistant and I love it. I've worked my phone life with animals. So yes, I've thought long and hard about it. And vets do make good money. You're probably thinking of a veterinary technician. </TEXT>
