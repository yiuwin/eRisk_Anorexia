	<TEXT> True true, I'm glad you like the lore! For me, maybe it's a bit greedy but I wish there was also very short flavor text that you can read even when in game. You know, while waiting for your opponent's turn. Maybe you could hold on the card and a sentence or 2 can pop out. For example, "Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty can from a distance of over 160 feet".

	<TEXT> I agree with you on this, the lore on the cards are a bit hit and miss for me at the moment. Some of it is a bit too vague right now. It would be nice to get some fun facts on the creatures, maybe a bit like Pokedex? haha. Tell me how much Earthwalker can lift! Tell me of a time when an Earthwalker grew way too large and destroyed entire cities :].  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hydras are a metaphor for her problems. One may die out, but they will never stop coming. Of course if you think it's all just random crap then it must be true! Lol have a nice day.  </TEXT>
