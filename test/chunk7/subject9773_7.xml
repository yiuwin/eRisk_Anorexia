	<TEXT> First, I would never intentionally hurt the people that I love most. That doesn't sound like a good time to me.  

I could be called manipulative at times, at least by the people that know me well. For instance, I'll be really nice to someone at work because I know that I can get someone to cover my shift if I don't want to work that day. Or try my best to change the conversation that benefits me the most (like warm and open body language, nicer tone, small verbal fist bumps here and there, etc..). So you could say that I'm a person who is generally nice, pleasurable to be around, and gracious.. or that I have underlying motivations to get what I want out of you.

I don't want to, or try to hurt people. I'm out of control on the empathy meter, but sometimes, I feel like *I'm* not that nice, just my actions are. I clearly have some unresolved issues with this. ugh. :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, welcome to the shoe gazers and the hermits. It sounds like you are an INFP to me... Don't really pay any attention to those dumb 3 paragraph descriptions. They are pretty lame! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I *totally* understand why you are offended. She probably isn't aware, or at least as aware as you are about gender identity/performance. I honestly think she was just trying to be friendly and supportive. 

She clearly doesn't have any issues with femininity, so if it develops more then you can explain her the *much* better reason to be supportive. For now, I'd say just take it as a fleeting drunk compliment. 

But I do understand.  
 "Oh no, I **love** the gays! They're so much fun!"

"Yeah.. I'm not very fun. I like to read, watch the news, and play video games.."

"Oh nooo!! I bet you know how to have a great time! Gays throw the best parties!"

	<TEXT> This girl at work always likes to hug and generally get up in my space. She was one of the smarter people there so I enjoyed talking to her a lot. One day I just couldn't take it anymore and told her "Hey, I need to have a little bit bigger space bubble. It makes me a little anxious when people are close to me all the time." 

She still hugs me every now and then but she always gives me my space bubble when we are working for the most part. Just be honest. It's not because she is gross and you hate her, touch just makes you feel uncomfortable. Tell her that people invading your bubble isn't comfortable with you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, I'm not sure. I'm generally very dry and sarcastic and it's sometimes really hard to convey that I actually mean the opposite of what I'm saying through a text. 

...but I'd have to consistently answer texts to know that. I'd like to pretend that I always have game though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a gay man, I wouldn't ever date a lady with a masculine body.. because they are a lady. If I tried, I would feel like I was completely objectifying her and erasing her gender and only looking at a masculine body. Hope that makes sense :) </TEXT>

I'd answer yes to both of those questions. I'm prone to depression as a person, but also I can't help but to *feel* that lots of things are structured around me contribute to this as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   relationships with INFPs end typically because of imagined slights, or the realization that nothing youve said for the last fourteen months have even been processed by their brains. 

Yeah... I'm that guy for sure. I think that I should feel a lot worse about it than I do though.  </TEXT>
