	<TEXT> I'm sorry in turn for misunderstanding where you were coming from! I'll grant too that his partisans can sometimes be quite frustrating, though I think this might be more of a product of their partisanship than of who they're supporting. 

I have a soft spot for Bloom too, in spite of the many things he's done to annoy. I've read that intro before, but thanks for linking it again -- always fun to have another good tooth-grind.

In any event, think nothing of it! You were acting on your experiences and the information available to you -- that's all anyone can do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Still, besides that, it was a verrry nice book to read. It also kept its charm when it shifted in full allegory, wich isn't easy to achieve for many books.

This is a good point too. For all that Joyce is the superior experimenter and draftsman of the human condition (or whatever words one might wish to use to describe his work -- mere writing doesn't seem to quite cover it), I certainly know which of the two authors I'm more likely to turn to when I want to have a good time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Chesterton's non-serial fiction is so odd in character that it is very difficult to parse what is his and what is artifical.

This is a pretty good evaluation of the problem. There is nothing typical or expected about what he writes; it's all so deliberately weird and unserious that it's practically impossible to compare it meaningfully to the work of other authors. Most of the people in this thread seem to have a favourable opinion of *The Man Who Was Thursday*, but there's nothing in it that really puts it on a different level than *The Man Who Knew Too Much*, *The Flying Inn* or *The Return of Don Quixote*. Its chief merit seems to be that it is more widely known and commercially accessible.

The standard by which I judge all of Chesterton's writing is his Autobiography. Having read that startlingly honest work, everything else he has written -- fictional or otherwise -- seems overdone and affected to the point of decadence.

That might point the way towards some comparisons, though. Chesterton is so little remembered now in part because he seems to have had the bad luck to have been a part of every literary school that *lost*. He was firmly on the side of the Squirearchy in the battle with Bloomsbury for the heart of English prose, and we all know how that turned out; he wrote ironical and satiric adventures that wouldn't have been out of place in the oeuvres of Saki or Wilde, but couldn't arrange to die tragically to cement his legacy; he produced poems that could have made Henry Newbolt or John Masefield rightly hanker with jealousy, but look where either of *them* are today. Even his less grandiose poems were thought to be too Victorian to be included in Edward Marsh's *Georgian Anthology* more than once. As for his drama, I've never met anyone who's read *The Surprise* or *Magic* and not enjoyed them, but when are they ever staged? Who would bother? The only people who would likely go to the trouble are also likely to be ideologues of some sort.

I'm sorry to go on and on like this, anyway.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  While The Man Who Was Thursday is an excellent book, everything Joyce did was operating in an entirely different world.

Exactly. I'm not even sure it's fair to actually compare the two, given how starkly different their work is. It's like saying that Wordsworth was better (or worse) than Thomas Pynchon. You *can* say it... but why?

As for influence, his Father Brown mysteries remain perennial favourites to both readers and mystery authors alike. Borges was impressed enough with his mystery writing (not just Father Brown, either, but also stuff like *The Club of Queer Trades* and *Four Faultless Felons*) to have declared Chesterton "his master," so that's at least some sort of influence worth noting.

Chesterton certainly never wrote anything on the level of *Portrait* or *Ulysses*, but it's also pretty clear that he neither intended nor wanted to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Well, he's kind of the Christian version of today's Gnu Atheists, smug, self-assured

This evaluation surprises me, I must say, given how frequently his works are marked with hesitation and doubt.

 I can't help but associate the man with the worst aspects of political and religious discussion in the world today.

This is just sensational nonsense. I apologize for being rude, but to say something like this in a world containing things like ISIS and Pat Robertson and the Westboro Baptist Church is frankly incredible. At his worst he was a rather fussy Oxbridge don who preached an aesthetically English Christianity; this is certainly not worthy of such broad condemnation.

Also, Harold Bloom is one to talk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  (Canonical simply means 'works that are discussed in literary criticism. That is an objective meaning, not a subjective one)

I find this interesting. From where have you derived this objective meaning, and what do you feel to be its most important implications? I'm not saying you're wrong, to be clear -- just expressing interest.

There's a lot with which I agree in the rest of your comment, I should say, though I confess that I have actually met some of the seemingly class-determined readers that are at issue, here. Well, maybe that's the wrong way to describe them; they're motivated by identity more than strictly class, choosing works that offer them a chance to see themselves and their experiences reflected in their pages. This doesn't seem to motivate *all* of their reading (and viewing, and listening) decisions, but it motivates enough of them to be noticeable.

Also, I hope you'll reconsider your decision to leave; it's too easy to talk past one another in a pure-text setting, and I'd hate to see a few downvotes out of 200,000+ users drive someone away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kind of wanted to go through the whole thread for things, but the recent AMA with the 'Great War' YouTube channel guy had this amazing comment from him:

 What tactics worked best when assaulting the trenches? I know of the creeping barrage, but I would like to have far more knowledge on the subject.

  I recommend two videos about the topic from our show:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfKUd8bvQfc  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsSxBSYdlsA 
If you want to read more about it, go for Erwin Rommel's Infantry Attacks.
Paraphrasing Remarque here: Melee weapons, a lot of hand grenades, constant movement and the element of surprise were key.

First, he offers two sources. Two. Sources. This is inexcusable given the absurd wealth of information that exists on this subject, and even more absurd given that neither of them is actually academic. It's not like he'd have a hard time finding things to cite for this.

Worse, the two sources he offers are a highly idiosyncratic memoir and a sensational novel. Rommel's tactics worked for Rommel, except for when they didn't; generalizing them into a totalized program for "what worked best when assaulting the trenches" is insane. Remarque's novel was a work of grotesque fiction by a deceitful author who spent a couple of weeks in the line before being confined to a hospital for the remainder of the war. He is no authority on anything -- not even himself, as his post-war career of pretending to have been a decorated officer suggests.

Why am I even going any further with this? He paraphrased *All Quiet on the Western Fucking Front* to answer a legitimate operational question for which hundreds of accessible and in-depth scholarly sources exist. I am beginning to think that my time-based decision not to follow this channel was for the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've just finished Liam O'Flaherty's peculiar little 1929 novel, *Return of the Brute*. It tells the story of a single day in the life of an infantry battalion on the Western Front, and about how the titular brute returns in the soul of the novel's protagonist. He has had enough, and something has to change -- so he changes it.

O'Flaherty was an important member of the Irish Literary Renaissance, but his significance as an author belies the obscurity that has fallen upon his most focused WWI novel. I think it deserves a broader readership than it has (I am not even sure that it's still in print, at that), and it would certainly reward critical engagement as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  *Obviously some did, but they were in a minority.

I get what you're saying, but this is illustrative of a problem that plagues studies of the war in a general sense. The war simultaneously bears two features: 1) it had more literate participants writing about their experiences and motives than ever before, and 2) nevertheless, virtually all of the war's participants left no written record of those experiences or motives. We're blessed with an embarrassment of riches in terms of written records, but those records are also *contextually* tiny when compared to the muteness of the whole.

The simple fact of the matter is that it is very difficult to know just what the men at Verdun -- or the Somme, or Passchendaele, or Tannenberg, or etc. -- were thinking about their experience. We can know what certain atypical men thought about it, but it is very hard to extrapolate any trend from this given that they really are atypical.

All of this is not to disagree with your comment, generally speaking, but rather to point out that the asterisk you've included says a lot more than people might realize. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition to the works already suggested here, you might consider the following:

1. F.G. Scott's *The Great War as I Saw It*: A remarkable and oft-cited account from a military chaplain who was also an excellent prose stylist. 

2. Will Bird's *Ghosts Have Warm Hands*: A Canadian infantryman's experience with the trenches told in fine style; the title refers to a seemingly supernatural encounter he had during the war, and which he describes in considerable detail.

3. Sidney Rogerson's *Twelve Days on the Somme*: A really excellent account of his time in that campaign, and especially good as a window onto the often banal realities of daily life. Highly recommended.

4. Vera Brittain's *Testament of Youth*: A lengthy novel-memoir based on the author's journals from the war. Brittain served as a nurse, and was at the center of a social circle that saw service in many other branches as well. An immensely tragic work, but very well done. Recently adapted into a film, and also had a very well-regarded TV mini-series back in the 1970s.

5. Flora Sandes' *The Autobiography of a Woman Soldier: A Brief Record of Adventure with the Serbian Army 19161919*: The memoirs of probably the most remarkable woman of the entire war. Sandes was an English woman who began the war as a Red Cross nurse working on the Serbian front, but through a series of unusual circumstances found herself inducted into the Serbian army and eventually awarded its highest military honour.

6. Edith Wharton's *Fighting France*: The famous author's memoir of what it was like as an American expatriate to watch the country she had grown to love go to war around her. A truly excellent account of things from a civilian perspective, but with considerable insight into the military side of things as well.

7. Guy Chapman's *A Passionate Prodigality*: Yet another memoir, this time from one of the great anthologists to emerge from the war -- you should also check out his Great War miscellany if you can, as it provides lots of snippets of the sort you're seeking, but from hundreds of different perspectives.

8. Adrian Carton de Wiart's *The Happy Odyssey*: Covers rather more than just his First World War experiences, but this is nevertheless one of the most sensational memoirs ever from one of the most astounding soldiers ever. de Wiart found in the war -- and generally in all wars -- a great deal of excitement and joy, and he writes of his experiences with an enthusiasm that is wholly different from what you'll usually find in such pieces.

9. A.O. Pollard's *Fire-Eater: Memoirs of a V.C.*: Another excellent memoir from a man who loved the war. Pollard was something like a British Ernst Junger when it came to his theories of redemptive violence, but he was very far from being as educated as Junger was. These are the plain recollections of a plain man who had few prospects and an unhappy life -- until the red god gave him a chance to discover where his real talents lay.

I can provide some more, but this is all I have time for at the moment! I hope at least some of them will help. </TEXT>

Bones | 6 pounds per ton
Dry bones and marrow | 7 pounds per ton
Crackling if pressed | 3 pounds 10 shillings per ton
Crackling if not pressed | 9 pounds 10 shillings per ton

Cooks were expected to save at least 1 oz of dripping per man per day if they could. They were also encouraged to use special sinks for washing up that would preserve the greasy water at the end and allow the grease to be filtered out before the water was discarded.

	<TEXT> I feel I should add, since I did not properly emphasize it in the post above, that in times of heavy fighting it was both possible and likely that the distribution system would break down and the quality and quantity of food received would be very poor.  To stave off such disasters, each British infantryman was required to carry at all times what was known as "the iron ration," which was comprised of:

- 1 lb of preserved meat
- 12 oz of biscuit
- 5/8 oz of tea
- 2 oz of sugar
- 1/2 oz of salt
- 3 oz of cheese
- two cubes of the appetizingly named "meat extract"

These could only be consumed as a last resort, and on the orders of a superior officer. Infantrymen found to be missing any of their iron rations could be formally reprimanded.

There was a dark side even to conventional service: due to strained resources, many of the rations (even water) were brought forward in reused cans that had previously been filled with gasoline -- the taste of it often lingered.  The necessary distance between the cooking operations and the very front lines, and the difficulty of the ground in between, meant that the hot food brought forward in the dixies was almost always lukewarm at best by the time it arrived, and very often just plainly cold.  Still edible, but not exactly hearty. 

At certain points of the war even the bread ration became a difficult prospect owing to flour shortages back home; at such times, a fine meal made out of ground turnip was substituted, much to the men's disgust.  Old, stale loaves were also often distributed out of a wish to avoid waste, but these were so hard that the men had to literally smash them apart with their rifle butts and then soak the bits in water before they could be eaten.  

As the war dragged on and the supply situation worsened, all rations were slowly scaled back.  The meat ration dropped by a third, for example, at least twice that I know of, and the War Office began opening contracts with less and less reputable companies for their tinned stew ration.  Horse meat eventually became a regular feature of the infantryman's diet (there was so much of it available, alas), and the men swore up and down that still more distressing animals had made their way into the pot.  At its worst, the stew distributed in tins was a mixture of turnips and carrots in a very thin broth.  Eating it cold was not a thing to be envied.

I'd like to go on a bit more about the stove situation (and the comparative merits of the Aldershot and Soyer portable stoves), but I don't have the time at the moment, I'm afraid!  I hope this has been of interest to you all the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm adapting the following from an older answer of mine, but with some additional material as well.

=-=-=-=

I know most about the British experience, so I'll be sticking to that below.

First, here is the standard issue *daily* food ration for a British soldier in the summer of 1917:

Item|Amount
:--|:--
Meat (fresh or frozen) | 1 lb
OR Meat (preserved) Bully Beef | 9 oz
Bread | 1 lb
OR Biscuit | 10 oz
Bacon | 4 oz
Cheese | 2 oz
Fresh Vegetables | 8 oz
OR Dried Vegetables | 2 oz
Tea | 5/8 oz
Jam (plum and apple) | 3 oz
Butter | 2 oz
Sugar | 3 oz
Oatmeal (3 times a week) | 2 oz
Rice | 1 oz
Salt | 1/4 oz
Mustard | 1/100 oz
Pepper | 1/100 oz
Milk (condensed) | 1 oz
Pickles (weekly) | 1 oz

----

Now, let's talk about distribution -- we'll start with breakfast.  Getting hot food in the front lines was amazingly difficult, though the men often found a way. The official means was to have it brought up from the rear by other soldiers carrying huge covered trays ("dixies") of pre-prepared food. Unofficially, many soldiers invested in small portable stoves or enthusiastically burned whatever wasn't tied down, army property or otherwise. Whatever the case, the men could hope for eggs, sausage, and very low-quality toast, if hot food was available; if not, they'd have to settle for hard biscuit and tins of corned beef ("bulley beef") and/or jam.

Tea would be brewed in the trenches, though often only "tea" in the loosest sense of the word; a popular alternative was colloquially called "burgoo," which saw the meager tea stores supplemented by sweetened condensed milk, whatever sugar could be had, and toffee or chocolate from the care packages sent to the men from time to time. The result was a very thick, hot, sweet mess -- perfect for an added dash of rum, a daily ration of which was also typically given out.  This often had to be done surreptitiously, though.

When off-duty, soldiers could snack throughout the day on whatever they had at hand.  Depending on where they were stationed in the lines, there was a great deal of scope for trade, purchase, or outright thievery, all the way up to liberating entire cows or pigs from their undeserving French or Belgian owners -- but you were asking about rations.

As the day wound down, dinner would be served, and it would often be very similar in its contours to breakfast. More hot food would be brought forward if possible (sausage and eggs again, typically), but would now be ideally supplemented with tinned vegetable stew. Maconochie's was a widely-distributed brand, and that name came to be used as a shorthand for tinned stews of all sorts. Typically lots of root vegetables in a broth. The men would do all they could to make their food more interesting, though often with limited success. It was sometimes possible to procure better fare from civilian sectors behind the lines, but they had it very hard as well and often relied upon the presence of the soldiers to bolster their own diets -- especially when it came to meat.  Bully beef was the only meat readily available for some impoverished French and Belgian citizens during the war, and the tins became something of a de facto currency.  Certain enterprising ladies even lit their red lanterns over signs offering a whole array of services carefully measured out in quantities of corned beef.

In addition to all of this, there was, as I mentioned above, the rum ration.  Rum was drawn by battalion quartermasters in brown earthenware jars marked "SRD," which stood for "Special Rations Department."  The men joked that it instead meant "Seldom Reaches Destination" or "Service Rum Diluted."  The ration would be distributed out of these jugs, and typically amounted to a quarter gill per man per day -- roughly equivalent to 1/16th of a pint, or about what you'd get in a shot glass. The ration was given out at the morning stand-to, and was officially viewed as "medicine" for political reasons.  It was a punishable offense to be found drinking on duty otherwise, but many men found a way and, if they were punished at all, it was often kept "in-house" for the sake of convenience.  Nobody likes paperwork.

Now, it would be easy to think that the men in the trenches would starve on such poor fare as described above, but in most cases it was rather the opposite.  The ration-production industry was a vast and largely efficient one, and the typical British fighting man was kept up on over *4000 calories a day*.  The rationing situation was so gigantic that a great deal of wastage sometimes occurred.

From Richard Holmes' *Tommy: The British Soldier on the Western Front, 1914-1918* (2004), quoting Captain Gerald Burgoyne:

 The wastage in rations is terrible. Going round the place [Kemmel, behind the Ypres salient] this morning, I saw enough tins of Bully thrown away, or simply left in their boxes, to feed a Battalion. The men really get far too much, far more than they can eat, and extra rations like tinned salmon are counted extra and the same amount of Bully is issued to the men. The same with the biscuits. Men prefer to buy bread, and tins after tins of biscuits are lying around everywhere...

Holmes goes on to note an "an artillery headquarters where the tent floors and paths were composed entirely of full tins of bully used as paving stones."

From Corporal Ronald Ginns of the Royal Engineers:

  I saw whole cheeses thrown to the pigs, and paths made of bully beef tins unopened, while many a good fire was obtained from army biscuits. But it was the sameness that caused us to spend our pay on French food.

In any event, the "sameness" that Corporal Ginns notes above is at the heart of the matter. British troops were very well-provisioned indeed, but the realities of mass-production led to a great deficit in quality compared to what they could get from the nearest French estaminets or what they could have mailed to them from back home. Since there was no danger of the supply of bully beef and biscuit drying up, these rations were often treated with reckless abandon -- up to and including, as we saw above, being used as architectural supplements.

Sometimes you got more even when you didn't need it to begin with.  Captain Burgoyne notes how extra rations were counted as such and the typical rations still came in regardless. This sometimes had interesting consequences in other ways: when a battalion in the firing line was engaged in fighting, rations for the battalion's full complement would be sent forward each day regardless of how many were left alive to receive them. In particularly hot times, this led to each survivor receiving food and drink meant for two or three men, if not more -- and while it was technically an offense to consume rations not intended for you, this was not something that anyone seemed to have the heart to prosecute.

As to your question about the men in reserve or resting behind the lines, there were indeed differences to note.

For reasons that are likely obvious, the most successful field kitchens were those that were situated as far from the firing line as possible. They tended to create a good deal of smoke in spite of the best efforts to construct smokeless stoves (which did achieve some success, I must admit), and consequently became prime morale-damaging targets for enemy artillery or aerial strafing. The British consequently perfected mobile kitchens that could move quickly, deploy quickly, and pack up again in time to get in, cook a passable meal before being bracketed, and get out again. Even at that, though, the food itself had to be brought forward via the dixie system already described above.

Further back, though, the construction of more permanent kitchens was possible -- to say nothing of commandeering the facilities available in still-standing buildings. Those nearest the kitchen could expect to rely on hot and plentiful food, and those *working* in the kitchens were also not above treating themselves to some choicer cuts of meat when it was available.

An interesting feature of the British Army's cooking discipline was that field cooks were expected to *be financially successful*. In addition to providing food to be offered as rations to the men, cooks were expected to prepare surplus food for sale to anyone willing to buy it. Each cook was also expected to make his own arrangements with farmers, merchants, and other suppliers to secure a constant supply of fresh (or, often, "fresh enough") ingredients, and cooks developed ingenious means of wringing the most out of what they had to work with. There was a tremendous trade in grease and dripping, for example -- a commodity in which the Army itself had considerable interest (and for which it had considerable paperwork), but which was produced in such quantities that cooks made arrangements to barter it with civilians for more mundane supplies. Some cooks became very wealthy indeed through arrangements such as these -- and sometimes the men under their care even benefited as well.

	<TEXT> Thanks very much for being here!

I have three questions, if that's alright:

1. At the time of the disaster, was the *Titanic* the main touchstone for comparison? Or was the more recent (and similarly costly) sinking of the *Empress of Ireland* spoken of more often?

2. What are your impressions of Diana Preston's *A Wilful Murder*? It's occasioned a certain degree of controversy since its publication, and I'm curious to know what your take on the matter is.

3. I have not yet had the pleasure of reading your book, so please forgive me if I this is something you've answered in its pages: what do you think of certain modern tendencies to exculpate the men of U-20 and place the "blame" for the ship's sinking on its alleged function as an arms smuggling vessel? To be more blunt, I have noticed a certain implication from some modern readers that the *Lusitania* more or less deserved to be sunk, or that any outrage over the sinking is no longer justified. What do you think on that subject?

Thank you again for being here. This is one of the war's more remarkable episodes, and I'm glad that you've taken the time to offer your account of it. </TEXT>

Oddly enough, the paper's founder, the bellicose and conservative Lord Northcliffe, was uncharacteristically delighted with the way in which English women had stepped up to fill vital industry roles, and published a number of essays admitting that their success had given the lie to many arguments that had previously been made about strict roles for the sexes and the advisability of admitting women fully to the public sphere.

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for joining us here again!

My question may lie somewhat outside the scope of this AMA, but I'm curious to know your answer to it all the same.  In recent years, so convinced have many people become that the war was started, maintained, and essentially dominated by "propaganda" -- and that "propaganda" and "bald-faced lying" are synonymous -- that there are now people who seem seriously to question whether the Zimmermann *was actually real*. Obviously it was, and Zimmermann himself admitted as much; I'm curious to know what you think about just why such an incredible new belief may have come about, and what you would say against it if someone were to put it to you.

I'm also curious about your thoughts on the state of awareness (if we may call it that) on the general public's part when it comes to the activities of German agents in the United States during the war. This, too, is often dismissed as mere propagandizing, though obviously it was a very real thing. Do you find people more open to hearing about it than they have been in the past, and more aware of the scope of the situation than they previously were?

Thank you again for stopping by.  </TEXT>

This lavishly illustrated article describes the ways in which the famous *Punch* magazine, one of Britain's most prominent historical periodicals, responded to the First World War through the production of widely disseminated editorial cartoons.

I once did (very) some rough back-of-the-envelope calculations on this and discovered that there were enough men serving in the front lines on each side to have manned those trenches continuously from the Vosges to Ostend simply by standing at intervals of about six feet. Obviously this didn't take into account many of the things you mention, especially when it comes to topography and the like, but it seemed to be a relatively vivid image of just how many people the Western Front was keeping busy at any given time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hector Hugh "Saki" Munro (1870-1916) was one of Edwardian England's finest satirists and ironists. His works applied a red-hot lancet to the boil of polite European society, putting the wealthy and self-satisfied into the oncoming path of satyrs, anarchists, natural disasters and -- worst of all -- pranksters like his recurring character Clovis Sangrail.

While Saki would be killed at Beaumont Hamel by a sniper's bullet in 1916, his literary legacy had already been secured by collections like *The Unbearable Bassington* and *The Chronicles of Clovis*, to say nothing of the bewildering alt-history (alt-present?) novel, *When William Came*.

"The Background" tells the tale of a travelling salesman who gets drunk and ends up receiving perhaps the most imprudent full-back tattoo ever created. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The brief history of manned space flight has been largely a pacific one, with such combat-oriented aspects of it as there have been being limited mostly to missiles or orbital lasers--and mostly only in theory, at that.

Have two space-farers ever had cause to fight one another while on a mission, though?  I don't mean two from competing countries during the Cold War, or anything like that, as I'm sure that would be an event I couldn't help but have heard of; instead, I'm wondering if tensions have ever boiled over on Mir or Skylab, or on a shuttle mission. I won't ask about the ISS due to the 20-year rule.

This is a pretty trivial question, all-told, but it occurred to me that a brawl in zero-gravity would be pretty interesting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While the reality differs in some details from the account you cite above, I'm wondering if your teacher might have gotten the assassination of Franz Ferdinand mixed up with that of the Russian Tsar Alexander II.

In 1881, while indeed riding in a closed carriage through the streets of St. Petersburg, the Tsar was assailed by the first of three waiting assassins.  This one threw a small bomb which exploded beneath the sturdily built carriage, killing many of those aboard but sparing the Tsar for the time being.  The chief of police, who was travelling with the Tsar, tried to persuade him to flee at once, but Alexander demanded to stay to tend to the wounded and examine the scene in person. 

A second assassin, likely scarcely able to believe his luck, threw yet another bomb. This one did its job, and the broken emperor fell in the streets, mortally wounded. He would die of his wounds later that day.

A third assassin hovered nearby, but his services did not prove necessary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a number of things that I'm working on, so it was a tough call as to what direction to take this.  I'd likely have to say the comparatively rare *Check-List and Index* of the works of Stephen Leacock that was prepared by Gerhard R. Lomer, one-time librarian at McGill University. The volume has since been definitively supplanted by Carl Spadoni's 1998 bibliography of Leacock's works, and I mean *supplanted*; comparing the two side-by-side is like pitting a hard-cover phone book against an issue of *National Geographic*. They're each useful in their way, though, so I'm happy to have both.

There is nothing esoteric or arcane about this where actual understanding is concerned, to be clear, but it's hardly the sort of thing that one would just have lying around. </TEXT>

On February 7, 1910, [a group of foreign dignitaries](http://i.imgur.com/n59z3zN.jpg) -- Abyssinian princes conducting an extended tour of England -- arrived at the docks at Weymouth.  They had come with the intention of inspecting HMS *Dreadnought*, the most formidable warship on earth, and to pay their respects to her crew and commander.  Her captain at the time was Herbert Richmond, a prickly and unpopular character in the Navy, but one who could be counted on to observe the proper niceties in a situation such as this.

Their arrival was not unexpected; Herbert Cholmondeley, a clerk of the Foreign Office, had telegrammed in advance to warn the *Dreadnought* and her crew of the dignitaries' imminent arrival.  Their Abyssinian provenance threw everyone off kilter; protocol demanded an honour guard and a formal reception in a case such as this, but the notice of their arrival had been so short that no Abyssinian flag could be acquired.  It was consequently decided (somewhat bafflingly) that the flag of Zanzibar would be flown instead, and the Zanzibar national anthem played.  The visiting princes seemed touched by the gesture, much to the crew's relief.

The inspection duly proceeded.  With the aid of an interpreter (the princes spoke no English), the visiting party made clear its complete satisfaction with the *Dreadnought* and her crew.  They were very impressed with the ship, very grateful for the warmth of their reception, very pleased to be able to report back home that all was well with the Royal Navy, etc.  Captain Richmond was suitably chuffed, and bid them a happy farewell as they departed.

The problem with all of this is that there were no Abyssinian princes.  Herbert Cholomondeley did not exist, and certainly did not work for the Foreign Office.  The "interpreter" was not interpreting anything, and the visitors were speaking gibberish made up on the spot.

The visitors were in fact artfully disguised members of the Bloomsbury Group, a literary and artistic coterie that had at the time attained a somewhat notorious reputation in England.  The ringleader of the hoax was Horace de Vere Cole (who never met a joke he'd turn down), but it involved a number of the leading lights of the Bloomsbury scene, such as Adrian Stephen, the painter Duncan Grant -- and a young Virginia Woolf.  They had been made to look like "Abyssinians" by the accomplished theatrical designer and make-up artist William Clarkson.

The hoax quickly became public knowledge and the Navy was suitably chastened.  The tricksters were never formally punished, as it was not apparent what law (if any) they had actually broken.  It became a matter of national embarrassment that a group of uncredentialed people off the street could simply board and walk around the Navy's flagship with impunity -- this, too, during a time of heightened international tensions.

Security was tightened significantly after the hoax, thankfully, but all involved were keenly aware that it could have been far worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, not all of the books one owns are necessarily meant to be "finished." I own many that are used for reference, for example, even though there would be no way on earth I'd ever sit down and read the thing from cover to cover.

His activities may also have been intended to endow a small (and actual) library after his death, or at the very least save other people the trouble of consolidating a certain kind of knowledge in one spot.  That, too, has tremendous value. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am currently reading Basil Thomson's [**Queer People**](https://archive.org/details/queerpeople00thomuoft) (1922), the memoirs of the man who served as director of the CID at Scotland Yard during the First World War. It's a sprawling and deeply entertaining work, including many interesting anecdotes about Edwardian-era crime and crime-fighting, but the things that stand out most are his narratives of the police force's attempts to catch and interrogate German spies in London. Thomson was personally involved in interviews with both Mata Hari and Sir Roger Casement, both of whom would eventually be put to death for their exploits. 

I will note that the 2015 edition I'm currently reading has changed the title to **Odd People** out of some sense of political expediency. The rest of the text has been left unaltered, thankfully. </TEXT>
