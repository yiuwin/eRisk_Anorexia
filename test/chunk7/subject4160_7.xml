	<TEXT> Why does it feel like everyone's quest prerequisites are different.... Anyway, if you haven't finished the entire Tan'Celg quest line (Biahno Lake Water Purification Plant), do that, do "The Bodyguard," it can be found in the tunnel between Sylvalum and Cauldros, see if you have any active Heart to Hearts in the Outiftter Hangar.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i think you have to do The Lurker, you can receive it on the Ma-non ship (entrance to Portside?) from Go Rogan (Wrothian). Don't quote me on this, its been a long time since I finished doing Normal Missions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Durvin does drop the II's with Potential Up and Boost, I got mine off of him, and he's a lot easier to farm than Feliciano. You can find him during the day in the Beast's Lair in Primordia </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but YOUR character isn't the unique one, you simply support and serve alongside the unique one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. I love the fact that Cross isn't anyone special, but instead is just an average BLADE just doing his job. This makes such a huge change from where the protagonist is the "Special Snowflake" and it's just insanely refreshing to see a "different" type of MC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NP. Collect all the Yggraliths, all three have different coloring a and poses. I think my order would be Yggralith Zero, Pharsis, then Phanatos. Yggralith Zero is golden (surprise, I thought it was black), Pharsis is white, and Phanatos is pitch black with greenish-white spines. Yggralith is doing its Dark Ray pose, Pharsis is just striking some flying pose, and Phanatos is in the Yggralith idle position. They're all super cool and probably the best holograms in the game (besides Telethia). I'm a bit of a Yggralith nut (pun intended) in case you can't tell.

Edit: Be prepared to do the mission sequence for Phanatos a lot. His hologram is a rare drop and took me at least 20 tries to get it. Also unequip any treasure sensor gear you have on if you want to have even the slightest chance of getting it. It's an RNG grindfest out there, but keep at it, it's totally worth! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to do The Insect's Fear, activate the treasure boxes, then complete the mission. This unlocks The Awakening, which is you vs. a black yggralith named Phanatos the Netherlord. He drops the secret hologram. This is in squad 20 and you have to hunt 14 Tersequals to unlock The Insect's Fear. </TEXT>
