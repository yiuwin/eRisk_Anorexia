	<TEXT> Almost all of the characters on Mad Men are awful in one way or another, but they are interesting and well developed; not just annoying and the show itself has a plot that you want to follow. I think it also helps that Mad Men is a period piece; we all know people with those bad traits but the context of the show makes it more novel and entertaining since those traits are being shown in situations that we ourselves don't experience. 

I know people like the characters on Girls and they drive me crazy, why would I want to come home and watch a show about them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like it because flavored yogurts are too sweet. I'll either eat it as is with some fruit or cereal, or add a little bit of honey. 

Also, plain NONFAT yogurt sucks ass. I only eat low fat (which is 1.5-2% depending on the bran) and it is so much richer, creamier and less weird and bitter. My dietician wants me to start eating whole milk yogurt but I can't imagine I'd be able to eat a meaningful amount with how rich it must be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ballet and strength training. 
I struggle with compulsive overexercising so I need my exercise to be somewhat self limiting. Ballet class is over when its over and I'm not creative or strong enough to spend more than an hour lifting so its harder for me to go overboard. 

Ballet has honestly been good for my body image; I like seeing what my body can do and I notice how much weaker I feel and look if I don't eat enough before class. My teachers have always been pretty body positive (or at worst, neutral) and always emphasized that we need to be strong and technically excellent, not delicate waifs. 

I miss running and cardio but I know ballet keeps me in good shape and that I can't control myself once I open that can of worms.  </TEXT>

My pediatrician always recommended that girls start going when they were around 16 no matter what. Even if you aren't sexually active or having any problems it is good to get comfortable with the experience, have questions answered by a professional and a lot of girls who should be going don't because they don't want to have to bring up the idea that they are sexually active with their parents.  </TEXT>

I think the biggest thing that you have to worry about is learning how to deal with their hair! I'm half black and came out with a full head of curly hair that my mom had no idea how to care for. 

Obviously questions about race will come up and I think that kids should be aware of their backgrounds but it doesn't need to be a 'thing'. I've never felt insecure in my racial identity and it honestly never occurred to me that I should be until people started trying to reassure me or ask me if it was an insecurity.  </TEXT>

Tried again when I was 8 or 9 thinking I was too young to get it the first time. 

Tried AGAIN in high school thinking that maybe I would at least be able to appreciate it as something that wasn't aimed at my demographic. 


I've never made it to the halfway mark of that book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have an eating disorder and my weight is too low for me to safely exercise so I've been sitting on my butt since Thursday and I'm so restless and now I have no healthy outlets for my stress. 

I was making good progress (gainz, mile times coming down) but then I got a stomach bug and lost 5 pounds and I feel like I'm going to end up back to square one.  </TEXT>

I'm really struggling with my eating disorder right now (managed to bargain my way out of leaving school for inpatient for now by agreeing to a weight contract) so this really strikes a nerve.

I LIKE exercise and I WANT to do it 6 days a week, but right now I need to sit on my ass and eat or I will be forced to completely derail my education. I wasn't even trying to lose weight, but because my brain is fucked up I managed to put myself back in the "danger zone" so now I need weekly doctor appointments and lab work to make sure my organs haven't started shutting down. 

I could rant for ages but I probably shouldn't haha.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Type 1 causes lose weight if it isn't controlled because the body isn't producing insulin so none of the glucose that you take in can actually be absorbed into your cells and used as energy. Instead, it just stays in the bloodstream and gets peed out, so patients are super hungry, crazy thirsty and lose a ton of weight until things get under control. 

Most of the type one diabetics are solidly in the middle of the healthy BMI range. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not "into healthy living", I have an anorexia/orthorexia and compulsively exercise. I function pretty well but my diet and exercise habits aren't a choice, they are my main coping mechanism and I can't deal if I am unable to workout or eat my carefully planned meals. I'm a picky eater with celiac disease so its pretty easy to convince people that my bringing my own food everywhere is normal. I am obsessed with food, I spend way too  much time on Pinterest looking for ways to get the most volume for my calories and just staring at recipes for things I could never let myself eat. 

Nobody that I go to college with has ever seen me at a healthy weight so everyone thinks that I'm a naturally thin, small framed person not someone with a larger frame who is at least 15 pounds underweight. 

I have made some progress; I rarely purge and I do eat 3 meals a day every day, even if I only eat so I have the energy to workout and do well in school and I limit myself to "safe" foods.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a full time college student so my wardrobe is pretty casual. I spend about 95% of my life in either scrubs, workout clothes or the "college girl uniform" (Norts/leggings and an giant t-shirt) 

My essentials: 
Leggings 

North Face Backpack (it holds EVERYTHING and still looks nice after years of daily use)

Patagonia fleece (lecture halls are cold!) 

Oversized cardigans, so I can look like a grownup in leggings and a tank and because I'm always cold. 

LLBean boots 

Birkenstocks

Tevas

Sports bras that don't give me uniboob 

Hats (beanies to keep my head warm in the winter and baseball caps for when I workout/run because I have super short hair so I need something to absorb sweat or it all ends up in my eyes)   </TEXT>

Many of them live in country club neighborhoods that HAVE POOLS and go on Caribbean vacations so its not like they don't have exposure to bodies of water, swimming just isn't seen as an essential skill in a lot of black communities and a lot of moms really don't want their kids to swim because it will mess up their hair.  </TEXT>
