	<TEXT> Not sure if this counts and I'm super late, but oh well.

I got my cat, Thomas, when I was two years old. We were inseparable. I'd push him around in a stroller, tie vines to his collar and try to walk him - he'd just flop on the ground and look at me - go on adventures in the forested area of our property. When I had my tonsils and adenoids out when I was 8, he slept on my head and would meow whenever I got up. He would lay on my stomach or stand at my door. For two weeks, he didn't leave my room. In 2011, I was diagnosed with an eating disorder and got really I'll really quick. I couldn't walk at one point. I was so cold and he'd curl up next to me, sometimes in my sweater. I left for treatment and my parents later told me that while I was gone he'd sit on my bed and mew. In 2012, he was 14 years old and grumpy, but we were still best friends. One day, I noticed he was lifting his food to his mouth with his paw and only chewing on one side. I took him to the vet and he said nothing was wrong, but Thomas ate less and less. Once I caught him with his face in a butter dish. He started to smell, especially him mouth. He lost so much weight. He wouldn't walk across the house. I'd had enough, something was very wrong. I took him to the emergency clinic immediately. The vet looked at him and then looked in his mouth. He had a tumor the size of a grape under his tongue. They asked if I wanted to operate. He was an old man, I couldn't put him through oral surgery. I opted for euthanasia. They gave me a while to tell him goodbye. I wrapped him in the blanket I brought and held him to my chest. This was my best friend. I held him and cried. He tried to climb onto my shoulder like when he was a kitten. Eventually, the vet came back in and asked if I was ready. They gave him the first drug to make him sleep. I held his paw while they did it, they wouldn't let me hold him. As they put the IV in, I told him how much I loved him, how much fun our adventures were, how happy he made me. He kneaded my hand one last time and his whole body relaxed. Then he slipped away. My best friend that I never knew life without was gone. I wrapped him back up in his blanket. They brought him out a little kitty coffin. I buried him under the sycamore in the backyard by my window. I hope he heard what I said, even if he didn't understand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Love these.  They almost look like digital art. Watercolor is my favorite way to paint and these are beautiful. Have fun experimenting! I don't know how new to watercolor you are, but salt adds a really cool effect. Unfortunately, it makes the painting decay a little quicker. Using different liquids is always cool, too. Happy painting! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No idea either,  but I assume it's kind of a jab towards the cop. He's on duty on a beautiful summer day. Others are relaxing in the sand, hence "it's a little sandy". The smug face is saying  "you're working, I'm relaxing, but I'll complain about this small thing because you'd take sand in your bathing suit over be in at work".

Just my take. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this is an old post, but I'm just seeing it.

My best friend is schizophrenic. Delusional paranoid schizophrenic. Over the last seven months, I've watched my best friend die and the disease take his place. I get where you're coming from. After a while, you realize you can't help. The only thing you can do is watch them get worse. It's depressing. 

Your last paragraph broke my heart. I hope you and your husband are alright.  </TEXT>
