	<TEXT> Warren Theatres do a pretty stand-up job of keeping it classy.

I do wish that it were possible that I could smoke herb in the Directors Suite in Old Town. If they could permit that, and somehow incorporate toilets into the recliners, I'd have no reason to be in here posting this right now. Wouldn't that be amazing??  </TEXT>

The Alien sees through its dome omnidirectionally. Kind of like a 360 degree camera. That opaque dome is like one big eye that sees all over.  </TEXT>

To elaborate:
Que up your copy of GOTG on monitor one, cue Raiders of the Lost Ark on monitor two, play simultaneously and experience The Dark Side of Oz in a new form. 

Raiders of The Galaxy? Guardians of the Lost Ark?

Don't tell anyone. This shits secret, and Gunn says he'll drop a nasty cash load on whoever spills the beans. I'd hate to be that person! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a third generation, Seventh Degree Rodeo Master,  I am quite ashamed to admit that I am scared of equine farts.

Bulls, goats, and pigs can fart all day. Heck, they could all shit in my face at once and I wouldn't bat an eyelash, but if I hear so much as a toot from a horse or horse-like being, my blood runs cold and fight-or-flight kicks in.

This hasn't been much of a problem until recently. Someone has been feeding the horses, ponies, donkeys, and zebras nothing but Enchiritos from Taco Bell. I haven't had the balls to enter a Rodeo Battle Arena in months. My kids are suffering from scurvy.

Please send donations. Or, if you can't do that, please investigate and discover the person or persons behind the misfeeding of my hoofed pals, and kill him/her/them.

Shalom!

	<TEXT> Marvel had nothing to do with my review, while I do thoroughly enjoy their films and comics (especially while I down a bowl of my favorite Rold Gold pretzels), they paid me nothing to piss all over Snyder's brand of white-ish brown, salted charcoal. Two stars for your comment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TBH, those are some lousy pretzels. While the sticks themselves are not so awful as to be commented on publicly, the nuggets are fucked. I have an easier time chomping through a bowl of Gobstoppers than those bastards. People talk about Cap'n Crunch shredding the ceilings of their cock holes... Snyder's straight up peels the ceiling right off. From the teeth to the uvula. Bone. That salty taste? Your own blood and tissue. Three stars. </TEXT>
