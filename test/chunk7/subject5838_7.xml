	<TEXT> Hey all, I'm looking for (mens) snow pants for my SO who faces the challenge of finding clothing for a large, active person.  Apparently most people who need snowpants do not have a 46-50" waist.  I've tried looking around locally (Denver) as well as online and I'm coming up empty handed.  My hopes are that there are other big guys out there that like to participate in the sport.  I understand that this may involve me shelling out a bit extra, and that is fine/expected.  Thanks in advance </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can't do much about that.  Seller support doesn't seem to care if you're out $$, if the customer says xyz, item didn't arrive despite having tracking and confirmed delivery, you *still* have to suffer the expenses.  The worst is when snot-nosed college kids change their address every 5 minutes, and get mad at YOU when you ship it to the wrong address.  Or, my favorite, when they forget to change their fucking mailbox and then their parent(s) write you an email saying I'm shitty for not sending it, they should get a refund, blah, blah, blah, and then an hour later "Oh, s/he checked their mail and got it."

	<TEXT> I've used both - assuming you mean [this](http://www.vitacost.com/Images/Products/1000/Palmers/Palmers-Cocoa-Butter-Formula-with-Vitamin-E-010181040009.jpg) as cocoa butter and [this](http://pics2.ds-static.com/prodimg/276092/300.JPG) as cocoa butter lotion.  The butter was more greasy/oily and worked okay, but I would only use it when I was weird pjs around the house or shorts before I got dressed, to let it sink in a little.  It can stain your clothes if you're not careful.  The latter, the lotion, is smooth and creamy, smells like chocolate and absorbs into your skin relatively quickly, like normal lotion.  Both are fairly cheap, $6 for the first (3.5 oz), $2 for a bottle of the lotion (17 oz).  I started using cocoa butter at first because of the vitamin E and smoothing scars/marks because I fell down a mountain last August.  Both have vitamin E and both have produced results for me, personally.  In a nutshell, I'd totally get the lotion.  Smells better, applies better, and it's cheaper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I buy wholesale and make anywhere from a 30%-50% margin (so buying at 50-60% retail price). I get higher discounts from people I've bought from routinely and/or at higher quantities. Your wholesaler is looking for a better margin for her because she's taking on the risk of having inventory that won't move (that's not a rip on you, just sales in general) and wants to make it worth her time to absorb that risk, along with shipping and listing fees, as well as customer service time and effort dedicated to timely packing/delivery. More expensive products may be good to have a 20% margin, but a wholesaler would still have money tied up in what they may or may not be able to sell or adequately advertise for. To be honest, I would pass on a product at 80% retail. As a seller, I would absolutely love to sell at 80% if someone was buying in bulk. I would advise you to have a quantity discount structure available to inquiring wholesalers and let them make their own decisions. Don't sell your product for less than what makes you a profit that you find acceptable!! </TEXT>

Have a variety of products.  Make sure you have good customer service.  Do groups.  I feel like almost no one responds to individual posts, but if we had a stickied "Advice for noobs" post, maybe that would be more helpful.  </TEXT>

(Depending on what color you want to be white.)  In the future, should you like to gift anything to your girlfriend or make stuff for your apt, let me know, and I would be happy to cut/ship you the vinyl for free.  Lettering is a piece of cake.

	<TEXT> Eh, I like to think it doesn't nag you. It gives you the hard facts about the types of food you eat and the calories consumed.  It's been proven that those who count calories are naturally inclined to eat less.  For me, it's because I'm too goddamn lazy to log food, so I'll just not eat it instead.  My goal is to use it as "training wheels" until I can eat healthy all the time without it.  I've gone off and on a couple times....I'm closer to success now more than ever! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My parents had a similar situation - my mom just **stopped breathing** at 7am, just lying in bed.  If my dad wasn't next to her, and didn't give her CPR until the ambulance got there, she wouldn't have made it.  It gives me the chills just thinking about it.  I'm glad you were so lucky as well.

	<TEXT> We got married in the Chicagoland area but to find a caterer, we went around to restaurants and asked if they would be interested in catering a wedding and if we could sample different dishes.  The place we used had never done a wedding before.  Ended up being a minimal cost compared to other restaurants we asked.  Remember that *you* have the money, and *you* have the negotiating power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would recommend jam from [Lucile's Creole Cafe](http://www.luciles.com/).  They make the jam themselves (they actually make their own ketchup, too).  It's not terribly expensive, runs ya about $5/bottle, and it's a nice, homemade, Colorado gift.  They have locations in Denver, Boulder, Ft Collins, Littleton, and Longmont. </TEXT>
