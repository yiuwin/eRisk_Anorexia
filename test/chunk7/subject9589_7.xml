	<TEXT> It's hard because no matter how many people tell you how beautiful you are and how you don't need it and it's a crutch, I just couldn't find the will power to stop. I hated myself for liking it and became a vicious cycle of self hatred where I used it to calm my anxiety while simultaneously causing the anxiety. I've had some pretty bad depression in the past as well which definitely didn't help but truly I began to understand I am the only one who would be able to save myself from it. With that in mind I just kept telling myself if I loved myself I wouldn't need to do this anymore. Eventually I started to believe it and once I realized they could still even grow back, that motivated me enough to want to see what I looked like with them. It had been so long since I had them I couldn't remember what I looked like without drawing them on. As cliche as it may sound, it's mind over matter and if I can do it you can definitely do it. It isn't apart of you and the only outcome is happiness and growth. If you ever feel stressed about it too or find yourself starting to do it you're welcome to contact me or pm me and I can give you my number as a sort of support system. Being alone in this is very difficult it's nice to have a helping hand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am. My mom cried when she saw me because I can't imagine how it would feel to be a parent trying to get their kid to break free from something so destructive. It was worse than any drug I've ever done. It's nice to believe in myself again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to add a little back story and reference, I have been doing this much longer than twelve years. Here's a picture of me in [the 5th grade] (http://i.imgur.com/ptM5hr9.jpg). I did happen to overcome it once before in the [8th grade] (http://i.imgur.com/EWtyJNz.jpg), but due to stress pulled them out all over again which was devastating. I essentially looked like [this] (http://i.imgur.com/Bd1QtqT.jpg) through out high school up until about half a year ago when I decided to learn to love myself. 

Edit: [no make up] (http://i.imgur.com/qWkd2DO.jpg) </TEXT>
