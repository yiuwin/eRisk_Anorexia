	<TEXT> To be fair, Britain's FPTP also prevented UKIP from gaining more than one seat. And a big reason for the Lib Dem collapse was Clegg reneging on his campaign promises. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was referring more to large-scale ground wars like Vietnam and Iraq. Those are the ones that crush presidents. It marred LBJ's legacy, and did the same to Bush.

Americans are usually okay with very quick ground wars, like the Gulf War, and ignore drone wars, like in Yemen. Obama showed that it's easy to get away with waging lots of micro-wars with drones, so that's probably how most wars in the future will be fought. Trump will be fine if he continues Obama's model. He'll be crucified if he launches a gigantic land invasion of Iran. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to [Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/208778/trump-job-approval-first-quarter-lowest-points.aspx), Trump still has an 87% approval rating among Republicans, which is similar to Bush's approval rating 100 days into his term, and higher than Reagan's. Two years ago, traditional Republicans may have been skeptical of Trump, but by now they aren't.

I actually think he's bleeding support from his nationalist-populist base faster than from traditional Republicans. The recent flip-flops have made the alt-right worried about him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's still too much war fatigue in the US, and even in the Republican Party, for that to happen. The interventionists were soundly defeated in the Republican primaries, and Hillary's Iraq War vote definitely hurt her too. The alt-right panicking after the Syria strikes shows that the isolationists won't start beating the war drums just because Trump is.

The Iraq War was possible only because 9/11 made everyone blindly rally around Bush. That hasn't happened with Trump, and without similar circumstances, an Iran war will never happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Even before FDR, blacks were basically split even between Ds and Rs.

Hmm, this doesn't seem to be true. [This source](http://www.blacksandpresidency.com/herberthoover.php) suggests Al Smith got only 15-30% of the black vote in 1928. But it also says blacks were becoming increasingly frustrated by the Republican Party at the time.

I don't know much about the Republican track record on race issues, but what I recently found out is that, as late as the passage of the Civil Rights Act, Republicans were [more supportive of civil rights.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/27/1377639659080/partycivilrights.jpeg?w=620 q=20 auto=format usm=12 fit=max dpr=2 s=e2b48772c34c943cdf7cff7292c1a636)

In general though, I do agree that the Republicans should have done more, and more earlier, to end segregation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The [original meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism) of libertarianism, before it was hijacked by the right, was quite similar to anarchism.

Personally, I'd place anarchists on a separate axis with anarchism on one end and statism on the other. </TEXT>
