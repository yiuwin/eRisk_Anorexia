	<TEXT> That's fair, I've had the same problem with the Splinters rune on Poison Dart. My reasoning is that the Shadow DH really doesn't give a crap about much beyond killing Guardians as quickly and as efficiently as possible. When you kill the RG, the rift is over, period. Besides, with the spread you're still just as likely to have two blades flying off into nowhere if you stand too far away, only now it's every single shot instead of just the last one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think the set dungeons are designed to be a tutorial on how to play the set. It's an experts-only level of play for people who know the set so well that they can even play it on a handicap. Maybe it's because I beat most of these dungeons pre-nerf and want them to stay hard to keep the cool wings exclusive ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've said it before, but I feel like the PTR is missing a golden opportunity to put the DH in the meta, but in an interesting and unconventional way: making the Shadow's set worth a damn as the premier single-target DPS build currently occupied by the gen Monk. The only thing holding the Ninja back is the monk's ability to attack so crazy fast that BotS stacks ramp up fast enough to compensate and then surpass Impale's slower spike damage. Holy Point Shot is a step in the right direction, but if all three daggers could hit the same target it would allow the DH's own Bane to compete with the monk and stay ahead. Forget about AoE; if the HPS was redesigned to fire off three daggers in succession rather than in a spread, it would IMO synergize nicely with the Ninja's focus on boss-killing and allow it to take that coveted 4th place in the meta. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a break from the grind; I'm also looking forward to the Challenge Rifts. It's almost like playing Diablo 3: Puzzle Mode, because a lot of the dungeons can't be beaten with ever-increasing numbers. You have to experiment with unconventional builds and playstyles, and that's appealing to me. It's one of the few things in Diablo that actually requires a brain beyond rote memorization. Even with the hard ones, I appreciate the challenge and that moment of satisfaction when you finally beat it after banging your head against the wall repeatedly. The high isn't all that different from beating a boss for the first time in Dark Souls, or another similarly hard game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand it's all just a matter of perspective, but I actually didn't have a problem with Wastes. Once I figured out using the Gangway rune kept enemies from touching me, it just became a matter of keeping that up at all times and resisting the urge to WW everywhere. I beat it in like two more tries and is one of the few set dungeons I regularly do from time to time just for fun :) Seriously, it's a blast! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Holy Point Shot suggestions </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-16 23:40:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Does anybody have strong thoughts on this item in the PTR? As a huge fan of the Shadow Impale DH (henceforth, "Ninja"), I'm of two minds. Clearly Blizzard wants to support this build with its own BiS quiver, and HPS in its current form is definitely a huge step up, but there is still room for improvement.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. First off, bear in mind I'm not on the PTR myself so this is all theoretical. For those who don't know, the Ninja is an astoundingly high single-target DPS build that focuses on mobility and elimination of priority targets. It suffers for AoE which is why nobody plays it much, but Holy Point Shot (a quiver on the PTR that allows Impale to throw three daggers in a cone) appears to be an effort to alleviate that.

What concerns me is that people running the Ninja build already know the AoE is butts and presumably want it to be the designated "titan-slayer" in the 4-player meta (a role currently taken by a monk with high attack speed who is able to ramp up those Bane of the Stricken stacks). More spread and having daggers flying off into nowhere is helping nobody.

Part of the solution to this is having those three daggers all able to hit the same target within a certain range, so the build essentially becomes a shotgun. It works, especially if each dagger can proc BotS, but it feels inelegant to me; the Ninja is about range and precision. Not to mention there are already more than enough melee to mid-range builds out there. My idea: instead of a spread, have HPS fire three daggers in the same direction, similar to the Splinters rune for Poison Dart but faster. In other words, less of a shotgun and more of a burst-fire rifle.

There are several benefits I can see to those willing to forgo the spread. For one, it could theoretically triple the attack speed, allowing it to compete with the generator monk for BotS stacks. Another reason is its ability to take out white mobs who get in the line of fire, a common frustration for Ninja players. The first knife takes out the mob and the other two proceed to target, like getting a pseudo-Overpenetration rune for free. Finally, it simply keeps with the spirit of a build that focuses entirely on precision and accuracy at long range. 

In fact, the only downside I can see (I'm only brainstorming) other than the area damage is having to stay in place long enough to fire three daggers in succession. It's probably only a fraction of a second, but every bit counts in this game.

Anyone else have thoughts on how to make the Shadow build useful? I really, really like this build, you guys. HPS is awesome but I don't want it to be a missed opportunity :)

tl;dr: preserve the range, triple the speed and stacks, and don't emphasize area damage, and you could theoretically shake up the 4-player meta </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like you put a lot of thought into it. Few objections, though...

Story: Problem with framing Imperius as the antagonist is he's already gone through an arc, from standoffish skeptic to reluctant ally, and then to real full ally. Besides, the Diablo universe already has a ready-made antagonist with unresolved Nephalem issues in Inarius, the angelic progenitor of humanity who was last seen being taken and tortured by the minions of Hell after losing to the Nephalem hero Uldyssian.

Story Mode: It's not spelled out, but a lot of evidence suggests that Blizzard really wants to make a new hub in the Skovos Isles, the Amazon homeland and the subject of innumerable conversations between Tyrael and Lorath. I'm no Diablo expansion bookie but if I was, I'd have good odds on that.

The rest of your suggestions are kind of a pick n mix bag, but some are legitimately interesting if overly optimistic. Still though, ideas are cheap and development is not, but Blizzard has definitely *not* given up on Diablo 3. They may be taking their time on a scale slower than players want, but personally I'd rather wait to get a great product than to receive a slapdash product right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Or better yet, what if one click released three daggers in very rapid succession along the same trajectory, like the Splinters rune for the WD's Poison Dart? That way you preserve the range while still tripling the volume, though admittedly it would take longer to fire off and leave you flat-footed. As an added bonus, if white mobs get in the way you can clear them and still hit the boss in the same shot, almost like getting the Overpenetration rune for free. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If all three can hit the same target then what we have is a shotgun by another name. The new meta will necessitate getting up close and personal, which aside from the fact that there are already more than enough melee and mid-range oriented builds in the game, it just doesn't feel right to me.

For one thing the Ninja as it stands now is highly mobile and able to strike from any range. The triple-strike mechanic you described would basically limit the range for max damage, thus limiting the number of places the DH can fight effectively. Second, it puts the DH in more danger for being closer to the fight when before he could just hang back and drop daggers of doom in on a Rift Guardian bogged down by a more tanky build. Finally (I admit this one is personal, but still) there's just something cathartic about the surgical precision of a single, devastating sniper shot from a full screen away, and it kinda saps that feeling to watch two more daggers flying off into nowhere, and knowing that I only have 33% accuracy with them :/

Don't get me wrong, I'll gratefully take HPS in whatever form they give us and call it a massive improvement. But as long as they're taking suggestions, I just want to keep the effective range and stack BotS bonuses quickly. If nothing else, at least narrow the spread of the two flanking daggers to make it less blunderbuss and more rifle barrel, if you understand my meaning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not on the PTR so this is all just theory, but as much as I love the Shadow Impale build getting its own BiS quiver, is the bonus of Holy Point Shot keeping with the spirit of the build? I can understand wanting to give a little more AoE but I thought that sacrificing AoE in exchange for massive single-target DPS was the whole idea, ideally a designated "titan-slayer" in the 4-player meta. To that end, the best thing HPS could possibly do is somehow increase the attack speed of Impale to really ramp up those BotS stacks. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been advocating the Armory feature since forever and am so glad it's being added! Just a quick question for those of you on the PTR: let's say I have two demon hunters. The female saves a build that has a Manticore but switches to Yang's instead. The male then takes that same Manticore from the stash and equips it. Where does the Manticore go if the female goes back to that first build? Does the male end up empty-handed?

Has anyone experimented with any other unusual circumstances concerning the Armory? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In that first push to 70, most agree that having a slower weapon that hits harder is preferable. This is because you depend a lot on your resource (Fury, in your case) and attacking faster tends to just mean running out faster, so attack speed in those cases is more of a liability unless you depend on your resource generating attacks. </TEXT>

Most will agree that the easiest one to solo is Tal Rasha's; as long as you watch out for the rock worms, I mastered it on the second try. Vyr's is easy too, if you're used to the playstyle, but steer clear of DMO unless you like the idea of banging your head against the wall for three hours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There have been quite a few changes since Season 2; the power creep is real. If you haven't yet, go to the Ruins of Sescheron in Act 3 and find Kanai's Cube, the update of D2's Horadric Cube. It's basically three new gear slots. Each character has four class sets now, and most items have been revamped to allow for crazy damage and toughness relative to season 2, so there's no shortage of builds that can clear formerly impossible GR's.

Some tricks from back in the day are still around as well, though many are outdated or compromised. If you can find two Unity rings and the follower token of invulnerability, you can still effectively double your toughness, but new high powered jewelry sets can make it difficult to find a place for Unity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have pretty much no idea what you're talking about. The MPAA does indeed have strict [guidelines](http://www.filmratings.com/downloads/rating_rules.pdf) on the rating system (arbitrary though they may sometimes be), and the entire point is to allow parents the discretion to determine what kinds of films are OK for their children to watch. You can't slap a PG on Big Boob Panty Ninja 6 because they'd get sued back into the stone age. It's a matter of liability; theaters mostly prevent kids from going to R rated movies unless accompanied, but otherwise it's the parent's job to be sure their kid isn't watching something inappropriate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is that a bad thing? Practically any build can get use out of Akarat's Champion as a support skill anyway; may as well have it up 100% when all you have is rares. Akkhan's may not have the highest numbers (and is certainly overdue for a tweak), but if there's one thing it does better than any set I can think of, it's versatility. No matter if the first legendary weapon/shield/bracer you find goes with Heaven's Fury, or FotH, or Condemn, or Blessed Shield, Akkhan's is *always* helping out in the background. It may not keep up in the endgame, but it's exactly what you need in the early season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That particularly shouty girl just over her shoulder is 15-year-old Hazel Bryan, saying something to the effect of "Go home, n-----, go back to Africa." You know, real class act.

So the story goes, she started listening to MLK Jr's speeches and came around years later, calling up Elizabeth Eckford in the 1960's to apologize. They've since met and even been interviewed on Oprah, though a lot of evidence suggests Bryan was only trying to cover up or downplay her own involvement rather than aiming for genuine reconciliation.

It turns out what people mean when they say "racism is bad" is "being called racist is bad" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've actually been thinking a bit lately about what makes a "good" starter set. It has to function well enough on its own without other support items, and it has to gel with a wide variety of whatever miscellaneous skills you do find gear for during that initial push. Akkhan's and IK are probably the most perfect starters out there, while Firebird (whatever else can be said of it in the meta) is a terrible pick. </TEXT>

The thing that makes something a physiological addiction and not just a psychological compulsion (like when someone is "addicted" to gaming or the internet) is a real, measurable and detrimental effect on the body when taken away: withdrawal. Drug and alcohol addiction may not be caused by an invader but similar dynamics are at play. </TEXT>

There's no fixing that without going in and redrawing the entire formula for DPS calculation, and at that point you're better off just making a new game. Weapons don't need to be primal for the same reason that *any* item doesn't need to be primal: it's not like the Ancient gear is going anywhere. There are seasons I don't even find the normal Ancient weapon I want. You can't account for RNG, you can only play the odds. Sic semper erat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, I'll say The Simpsons as both answers.

It's been nothing short of a cultural institution for more than one generation at this point. As a kid what drew me in (as well as I would imagine most of my age bracket) was not the acerbic pop culture satire or sharp writing, but rather the fact that there was a cartoon with violence, family dysfunction played for laughs, and a smartass kid that sassed authority figures and got away with it. What? It's OK, we were kids!

So episodes that showcased the less mature humor ("Bart the General", "Some Enchanted Evening") that I considered the best at the time, I go back and consider kinda lacking as an adult. Meanwhile the boring episodes to kid me ("Life On The Fast Lane") had a wit I couldn't then appreciate, and tend to hold up a little better. So yeah, taken as a whole the show has been a series of ups and downs that has remained consistently above average, I just learned to appreciate it in different ways as I got older. </TEXT>
