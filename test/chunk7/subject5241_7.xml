	<TEXT> The current one is a lot of fun, I like the changes and the documentary style but there's a few things that need to be changed...
1. One game away from a World Series sweep, no pregame speech or anything. Way to make it seem big.
2. After sweep, NO celebration or anything fun. 
3. Trade requests suck this year, I want to request a trade without my agent.
4. The sleeves not being customizable if you receive one or buy one. 

What else is good? Bad? Should be changed?! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My father continues his obsession with my hair and how it's a failure with this lovely comment as I walked in the house after it'd been raining.
"Your hair looks shitty and crinkly you need to cut it you look like an animal"
When in reality? I cut it last week. My campus is big and I had to walk across which caused my hair to be wet. He constantly makes it out to be like he's perfect and with my hair being like it is I'm a failure and look like shit. Everybody has to be exactly like him and if they're not then they're wrong and they suck.  </TEXT>
