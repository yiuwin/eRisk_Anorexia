	<TEXT> It's 12 pages of text. I'll try to summarize it as best I can, please excuse the shorthand I use on this, and if you have any questions just reply.      

* Concerns were brought up regarding rolls of Silvertowne 2015 buffalo rounds   
* Several users with testers posted their results, most were good but as many 3-4 per roll were reporting out of band   
* A few users tried to contact ST either through eBay or directly, there were a few useful contacts, but for the most part they got a canned response (about how ST sells a high quality product and has for many years, etc....)   
* Concurrently with the above three points, there was an ongoing debate as to giving ST the benefit of the doubt due to their high respectability and being long honest and known high reputation. This debate continues throughout the later pages as well, weaving in and out with the other topics discussed.     
* A user ("mnymgr1") claims to have made contact with someone higher up in the organization and that a ST response on the forums is incoming)   
* Two pages, later user "Silvertown LP" replies with the following:  
  
Dear Bullion Stacker Members,  
 nbsp;  
We at SilverTowne are very concerned that some of you have received silver rounds from us that you believe are not at least .999 fine silver. As a respected member of many Numismatic and Bullion Associations, we make every effort to ensure our products meet the highest standards of excellence. And as a manufacturer of silver bars and rounds for more than three decades, we have maintained one of the strongest reputations in our industry, providing high-quality, competitively-priced bullion products directly to consumers and wholesale dealers.  
 nbsp;  
We first want to assure all of our buyers that if you have any concerns with the products you received, you can return the product to us for a replacement, or a complete refund. We are unsure at this point exactly what may have caused the discrepancy in the purity of the silver we received from our refineries, and the silver content reflected in the testing some of you have noted in your comments. We expect to receive the first samples back from some of you later this week, at which time we will inspect and assay them to determine their purity.  
 nbsp;  
We appreciate your patience while we work to resolve each of your concerns. Please feel free to contact us through the eBay Messaging system, if you have questions on how to make an exchange or initiate a return.  
 nbsp;  
Respectfully,  
 nbsp;

SilverTowne-eBay Business Manager

* Immediately after, the efficacy of responding to eBay issues here vs on eBay comes up, along with a short debate on requirements as to where they respond for eBay related customers' complaints.   

* The following insight from user "natsb88" (note: I have not verified this at all, so take it as his opinion/speculation only):  
Resistivity increases from left to right as you are looking at your PMV screen. A reading out to the right means higher resistivity than expected.  
 nbsp;  
Pure silver is very conductive (and therefore has a low resistivity). In fact, silver is the single most conductive metal. Which means as soon as you start to add atoms of anything else to silver, even in trace amounts, they begin to interfere with the flow of electrons through the metal. How much they interfere (meaning how much they decrease conductivity / increase resistivity) depends not only on the amount of foreign atoms, but also what they are. Some metals will cause a greater loss in conductivity than others, even when present at the same percentage by mass. (This is why 90% coin silver is so challenging to categorize...that other 10% is nominally copper, which is about 95% as conductive as silver, but as soon as you drop in a trace of something like lead, which is only 7% as conductive as silver, it throws everything off).  
 nbsp;  
Temperature also affects electrical conductivity, and therefore the PMV reading. Metals become more conductive at lower temperatures, thus exhibiting lower resistivity, and less conductive at higher temperatures, thus exhibiting higher resistivity. (If you find this phenomenon interesting, go to YouTube and look up superconductors.) So cold temps will move the block left and hot temps will move the block right. For accurate testing, the Verifier and metal should both be at room temperature.

* Also of note to the above, "natsb88" sent off the worst "offender" from his tubes (read 3 blocks to the right) and shipped it out to testing. I didn't include it in my previous points, but others have also sent coins off to ST and/or for independent assaying using pre and post melt XRF and other verification.  

* I'm going to quote the definitive answer from "nats88" from the assay results he got back, as well as his conclusions (page 10 and 11 of the thread):   

They first tested the round as-is on both surfaces.
 nbsp;  
Average Before Melting
.9988 Ag
.0012 Pt  
 nbsp; 
They then melted the round into a homogeneous blob and tested it again.  
 nbsp;  
Average After Melting
.9999 Ag  
 nbsp;  
Now, if there really was a trace amount of platinum in the alloy, it would still be there after melting. Since the metal assays at .9999 after melting, it really is pure silver. So what is going on here?  
 nbsp;  
These results suggest a very minor surface contaminant on the rounds. Something that interferes with surface testing, but burns away when you melt the silver.  
 nbsp;  
If you do an XRF assay through a plastic slab, it will often show a trace amount of Pt and/or Pd in the results. That is not actually in the coin, but is the result of interference from the plastic. This would suggest that other non-metallic substances could throw off the results too.  
 nbsp;  
A round going through the minting process could be exposed to lubricants from any of the hundreds of moving parts in the production line. There could be a small amount of oil or some other release agent on the dies. The blanks could be washed with a cleaning solution prior to coining that doesn't fully rinse away. Anything on the surface of the blank or the dies at the time of coining will essentially be embedded into the first couple thousandths of an inch of material, meaning it won't simply wash away later.  
 nbsp;  
A minor surface contaminant could interfere with the PMV's electrical testing similarly to how it can interfere with an XRF assay. The variance from one round to another within the same tube (some rounds reading as expected, some rounds reading 2-3 blocks to the right) also supports the idea of a surface contaminant increasing the resistivity of the round. It is very unlikely for the metal content to vary from one round to another within the same production batch, but completely plausible that some type of minor surface contaminant would vary from one round to the next.
 nbsp;  
Once I get the melted round back, which assayed at .9999 fine, I will test it with the PMV again to make sure it reads as expected. I will also continue to pursue some hardness testing to see if variance in annealing and coining could contribute to the different readings.  
 nbsp;  
The takeaway from all of this should be:  
 nbsp;  
- The 2015 Silvertowne Buffalo rounds really are .999+ silver :thumbup:  
 nbsp;  
- The PMV is a very sensitive and useful tool, but you need to know what it measures, how it does it, and what can affect the results. It is not meant to replace the human brain, so don't turn yours off when you use it :thumbup:  
 nbsp;  
- Keep calm and stack on :thumbup:    

 nbsp;  second post

After discussing this more with Sigma they do not believe the slightly right PMV readings to be due to a non-metal surface contaminant, but perhaps due to micro cracks in the surface of the rounds from the minting process. Such cracks would be plausible if Silvertowne is not annealing or fully annealing the blanks before coining, or are coining at particularly high pressures. Those cracks would affect the PMV reading but would obviously disappear when the round is melted. In that case I'm not sure what would be causing the slightly 999 initial XRF assay though. I actually wouldn't be surprised if Silvertowne figured out a way to skip the annealing process on these. They are cranking out an ungodly number of these rounds at miniscule margins for their eBay promotions. The design is also very shallow and not so crisp. Could be that they skip the traditional annealing step and just crank up the coining pressure on these. Just postulating here...  
 nbsp;  
In any case, whatever is causing the unusual surface readings on these rounds does indeed disappear when melted. Below is a photo of the silver round that was melted and assayed a second time for the "after" results. I rolled it flat enough to test with the small wand and it now reads inside the brackets. It read 3 blocks to the right of the brackets before melting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, unfortunately it isn't. That being said, while the people here who are in favor of American hegemony and the supposed economic and political exceptionalism that allows us to do things like worldwide taxation (i.e. the people opposed to my view) are perfectly willing to reasonably discuss a million other issues, most of which I agree with them on, they aren't exactly willing to reasonably assume validity to other arguments either.   
There's extremists on both sides of every issue I'm afraid, and while one side definitely holds more blame than the other. The side **without** the orange baboon isn't perfect either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is actually one of the few things in his plan I can support. Do you realize that we are pretty much the **only country in the world** (bolded for emphasis) that does not use a territorial tax system?    
We don't have some great form of American exceptionalism that makes that make sense, not to mention making that morally or ethically defensible. No! We're just that arrogant and pig-headed that we think that because we're America, we deserve to tax income from companies and people who are, in the case of people often solely by birth, tied to this country when no other country claims that right.   

Since I don't hold hope that our government, and more than a few people here who vehemently defend our system, will get its collective head out of its ass, tax holidays every once in awhile to at least incentivize companies bringing the money back in is the next best thing, since it'll still help our economy. </TEXT>

Some of the Rockefellers still have money of their own (not tied up in foundations and other restricted entities where they can't use the money for themselves), but the Vanderbilt's have lost most of their money, as have many if not most of the other robber-baron families. Unless there's some reason to thinking that these new-wealth families have some secret that these, arguably very smart, people didn't, they'll lose it all too given time and a few stupid heirs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No more silly than the idea that there shouldn't be a legitimate discussion as to the government's role, if any, of using taxation to achieve social/societal goals, rather than for the original sole purpose of using taxation to raise revenue for the state.   

There very much is an argument to be made that the government shouldn't be using, arguably misusing, tax policy as a form of social leverage to, in essence, blackmail people to do what the government wants. It is in fact IMO ethically and morally suspect for it to do so, especially since it is inherently and unequally picking winners and losers in the process (case in point, punishing renters with the homeowner tax credit). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the most part, there is some other part to the transaction. Money is taxed when it is exchanged for something else, be it goods or labor. The one time other than inheritance where that isn't really the case is money earned on money without buying or selling an asset, such as for interest or dividends. Large gifts are also ostensibly taxable,  but not necessarily actually taxed (in practice, not necessarily legally) if they're something non-monetary such as art. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a pretty broad definition of income you're trying to drive a logical truck through. A transfer of assets from one person to their descendant(s) is not income by the farthest stretch of the word. It was income when the first person earned it, but giving it a $5/10mil (single/married) exemption just cements the idea that the government isn't treating it as income on the transfer, but as an asset tax. That's is at least worth questioning since it is really the only federal asset tax (property, vehicle, and other such taxes being at city, county, or state levels). </TEXT>

I'm more worried about the rate of false negatives (fake/plated pieces testing as real), since if the machine is wrong then, then you're probably out quite a bit of money. If there's an even more than infinitesimally tiny rate of false pieces testing as real, then that totally negates the purpose of having a tester. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After the fucktardery that they pulled to try to scuttle medical reform, they can go fuck themselves. I, and many other people, will go out of our ways now to fuck them over to any extent that we can become aware of.   
I will happily lobby my representatives against any bill that that they support, or for any bill that they oppose, solely to screw with them. I will donate to any legislator that stands up to them. I have a life so I won't spend every waking breath trying to screw them over (plus that would be overly dramatic), but I will spend some of my free time working to do so, because they deserve it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You do realize that you don't have to keep it **in** your logbook, right? Much less show it to every CFI, FBO, or FAA inspector as they see fit. The suggestion is to keep it with or in your logbook so you don't lose it, but it's just stupid to believe that there is some mandate as to where you specifically have to put it.   

You can and should tell any CFI or FBO who wants to see it to fuck off, and the FAA inspector can ask for it, but as the ASI above said, they don't care about anything except the certification by your doctor on the last page. </TEXT>

If there's some sort of incident then the pilot would have to show it, and the doctor might be forced to show their copy, but otherwise it's a lot less onerous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those laws are also a good example of why populism is bad policy. Laws against price gouging, in general not necessarily in the case of a restricted market like pharmaceuticals, have been shown to reduce supply and slow the restoration of supply back into the area with an emergency occurred. The laws also encourage hoarding.   

Again, doesn't really apply to those laws when they're (wrongly IMO) applied to something like pharmaceuticals which is already subject to a lot of supply restrictions among other things, but since you blindly mentioned price gouging laws, it should be pointed out that they at best don't work and at worst actually make problems worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, fine line balance. What the administration needs to do is create a viewpoint neutral (both in the the rules as written and in effect) set of rules for clubs when it comes to speakers.   
Controversial speakers, i.e. (in/at Berkeley, conservative speakers) should not and cannot be penalized for the fact that precious little liberal snowflakes don't want to let them speak and indeed don't recognize their right to speak (at least not without being shouted down/interrupted until they give up).   
In that same vein, no speaker, liberal or conservative, should be penalized for the fact that anarchists/rioters/and other pseudo-fascist elements from either or both sides, want to use these speeches as a platform to further their own ends, most of the time through use of violence.  

That's where the line stands. You've crossed the line IMO the moment you start taking action that punishes the speaker, by restricting their right to speak or erecting extra barriers to their speech, solely based on the content of their speech or because of of the reaction of others to that speech. Incidentally, that's also the stance the Supreme Court has taken when it comes to the right to free speech an the right of speakers to not be silenced by the heckler's veto. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're barely letting her speak. We don't know all the terms but they are by all accounts pretty onerous and we can assume that they're beyond what she feels she wants or needs. Maybe she's willing to be shouted down or even assaulted to serve as a martyr, but assuming she doesn't, then the University is actively hindering her speaking by trying to force a delay and these terms on her.   

I'd agree that the school has an interest in ensuring safety, especially in circumstances like this, even, as you said, when they otherwise wouldn't be informed. That being said, there is a very fine line between giving in to a violent mob (on both sides of the political spectrum, since the far right wants a fight as much as the far left) and working to keep order in the venue while allowing her to speak and doing their best otherwise.   
If people want to hurt each other, they're gonna hurt each other, the University's goal should be to protect the speaker, school property, and any uninvolved members of the public that may be in the area. Likewise, City of Berkley PD should be worried about innocent people and city property, not what a bunch of douchebag anarchists and fascists do to each other when they're actively looking to start a fight/war.   
The focus here, on stopping these idiots from fighting seems way off, and totally unrealistic. There's no reason why the immediate goals, tied in to protecting her and letting her speak, can't be achieved though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Protest can take place to try to stop the speech but the school has a moral, ethical, and probably legal duty to protect the speaker and do what they can to allow the speech to take place. The speaker is an invited guest of the school, by the fact that the school has dedicated the authority and the funds to the clubs to invite speakers that might interest the clubs to speak.    
The same isn't true of the protesters. The protesters of course can speak, but not necessarily in the same venue at the same time, and to the extent the rights clash, it seems pretty obvious that the invited speaker has a greater right to speak at the given time and place designated than the uninvited protestor. That's not to say the protestor can't protest/speak, just not in a disruptive manner then and there. </TEXT>

That's your opinion, but you're wrong in this instance because as a public institution, the school itself, by allowing the clubs to pick speakers, doesn't get a right to veto speakers just because they may not be liked by people outside the club, doubly so if the club's discretionary funds (as in, at the discretion of the club to spend how they want within a given set of guidelines) are being used (which is what it seems like) to pay the speaking fees. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a legitimate question as to whether clubs usually notify the University higher-ups for speakers invited by the clubs though. If a club got a smaller name speaker and booked a space, would they be expected to get the OK from the school to do so beyond that?   
I don't know the answer for sure, but I would strongly suggest the answer is no. The University is in a no-win situation here because at best this is blatantly political, and at worst this is a double standard and cowardice because they have to give in the heckler's veto, mainly the threat of violence by anarchist fucktards (the violent mob, not to be confused with the people who want to, and need to have every chance to, peacefully protest this bitch). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With the little of the language I know (and admittedly I relied a bit on Google Translate for this) I always get mixed up on the to/from relationships in German. I can't be the only one though, I remember 30 Rock had a bit of one of the episodes' plots (the episode where Cabletown is buying a German network). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Next time APMEX or Provident does that I'd love to see it, because I've never seen it happen and I honestly doubt they'd be that stupid. Jacking up prices just makes customers think you're ripping them off and eventually builds up a bad reputation.   
Plenty of people, myself included, only heard about BGASC because of this, and because this is the first impression that they leave, will never give a cent to them now because they've shown themselves to be scummy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, but fuck BGASC for being assholes by ripping people off because of it. You didn't see Provident do that with P2 onwards to capitalize on that, because they aren't stupid enough to drive off customers and ruin their reputation by ripping them off. BGASC may make short term profits acting like this, but they'll get a horrible reputation and they can't survive just off de-facto exclusivity on series. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So that isn't a mistake? Fuck them then. That's how you make sure that nobody ever goes back and buys from you ever again.   
2.5x spot is a ripoff and they need to not only be denounced but blackballed for trying that shit if it's really the price they're charging. I don't care if they have defacto exclusivity, Provident doesn't pull that shit, even APMEX (arguably the biggest name out there) would never pull that type of bullshit because they know that nobody would buy from them again if they did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ~~Two things, they're now listed out of stock. Is that a temporary thing or is the run totally sold out?   
Secondly, the site lists the price as $92, that's about 2.5x spot. Is there a reason for that when every piece so far in the series has sold for spot plus a fair premium? Hopefully you'll come back and tell me that's just a big mistake or I'm reading it wrong, but that seems ridiculous if true.~~       

That's how you piss off potential customers and make sure they never purchase from you again, if they'll even purchase from you the first time when you blatantly try to rip them off. Again though, I really hope I'm wrong and can apologize for implying that your company would be that douchey.   
 nbsp;  
Edit: Apparently not a mistake so good luck getting anyone here to give you money in the future. I'll happily mention the fact that you rip off your customers anytime your business comes up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for clearing this up and it somewhat preempts the somewhat indignant, and to be truthful more than a bit angry, comment I was going to write after reading the OP.   
That being said, this still doesn't make me feel great about Provident, and whether it's your fault or not, I'm really not happy after buying Privateer 1-5 **from you**, mainly because you, until now, have absolutely blown other sellers I've tried out of the water in terms of customer service, quality, and reliability. Not making a deal to carry the whole series strikes me as a huge oversight and if nothing else it doesn't engender loyalty.   
I'm only one customer, and I'm currently locked in to buying another series (the Four Horsemen) from you, but I'll be honest when I say that this will make me reconsider future series releases I see from Provident and overall hurts my loyalty, especially when it came to the fact that Provident was the first place I looked when looking for new silver to buy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was pretty much no chance for individuals after the very beginning (during which individual work was often randomly snuffed out anyway), which IMO was kind of the one downside to it. The only way I could think of them being more individualistic though would have been to lower the delay, which would allow individuals an edge over larger groups (unless they use scripts, which could be discouraged in other ways). </TEXT>
