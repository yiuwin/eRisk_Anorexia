	<TEXT> They are extremely dissimilar.  
Warhammer 40k has a good sense of just how vast intra-galactic distances are.  
All interstellar communication is time consuming and highly lossy. All interstellar travel is time consuming and dangerous.    

Palpatine can communicate near instantly with anyone using the holonet, he doesn't have to find an astrotelepath, translate the message to symbols and metaphors, then hope that the message doesn't get diddled by a daemon half-way through.  
Palpatine can hop on a shuttle and reach pretty much anywhere in the galaxy within a couple of weeks. When a ship enters hyperspace with a proper calculation it is almost certainly going to exit where it wants in a timely fashion. It doesn't risk getting caught in a warp storm, get infiltrated by daemons, or flung through time.  
  
This combines to result in an empire that is far more centrally planned and ruled, as opposed to the quasi-feudal system that the Imperium has, where most worlds are by necessity more or less completely autonomous.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the start it was 1 vs 330, because only the Yi's flag ship was brave enough, the remaining 12 only joined in later.  
It's worth pointing out that Yi lost no ships in that engagement.  
  
However the real tactical thing was this: Yi's ships had many more and better cannons and would fire broadsides into anything on the water.  
The Japanese barely had cannons on even their largest ships and would usually try to board.  
  
So it's less 300 and more Space Invaders.     
Yi had several naval engagements with the Japanese and lost few to no ships simply by staying back and broadsiding them to death. </TEXT>

This chemical is known to attract bugs that eat other bugs.   
Usually when grass is damaged it's because of bugs eating it, so it releases a chemical to attract things that eat the bugs before they eat more of the grass.  
So basically the smell is grass trying to call for help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your nose contains cells called Olfactory receptors.  
There are about 1000 different kinds of them, though you probably don't have all of them.  
When a scent molecule comes into your nose, it tends to stick to some, but not to others.  
When a scent molecule sticks to an Olfactory receptor it sends a signal to your a specific area of your brain called  the Olfactory Bulb.   
From there it sees which kinds of receptors are firing and how many are firing and figures out what smell it is and how strong.  
For example, these kinds of receptors are firing, these aren't, not alot of them are firing so this smells faintly of strawberries. </TEXT>
