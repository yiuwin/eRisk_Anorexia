	<TEXT> I mis-read one of your comments.  No, the increases were not due to the federal government.  but the more important thing was he did absolutely nothing to curb them.  No, I was not implying that the decreases we've seen so far were mainly because of this federal government.  That's why I mentioned it was before the carbon pricing is fully in effect.  I think I've made all of this clear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right.  But at the end of the day we hold the coach responsible.

Uh, maybe because despite all this they finished 42-40?  They're mediocre.  We should not be struggling with a team that finished one win from .500

Khris Middleton is good, but he has no excuse to get embarrassed like that.  If it was LeBron then whatever, shit happens.  But it's Middleton, he's good but not nearly that good.  No truly good defender would get embarrassed he did by Middleton.  He's mediocre on defence and useless on offence who is okay rebounding.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did not mean to imply that it was from federal action, yet at least.  It may have had some effect.

My point was more that emissions are already declining - and we haven't seen the full impact of carbon pricing set in yet.

Blocking pipelines is a *terrible* and inefficient way to combat climate change.  Forcing the oil sector to simply operate more inefficiently so it won't be profitable to take oil out is a horrendously stupid strategy.  Its akin to making them dig the holes with hand shovels.

We have far more effective and efficient means of combatting climate change, carbon pricing chief among them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nuclear does indeed work.  But whether it can or how much nuclear can compete on cost in the future will most likely determine its role.  Wind and solar are both already cheaper, so it will depend how cheap they get, how much additional costs it takes to integrate them, and if nuclear can make any cost improvements.

Right now, nuclear would be needed if you tried to go 100% 'clean' and your country did not have significant hydro, tidal, or geothermal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Read the last article.  Fantastic read.

Its not that easy.  Seasonal changes mean it would take a truly massive amount of storage, like an unbelievably large amount.  Not impossible, but very difficult.

There are a number of possible solutions.  It could very possibly end up with a smart mix to balance supply with some storage combined with excess production knowing we will have to curtail some.  But it all depends on the economics of the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not quite.  [Prices are already competitive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source?wprov=sfla1).  Thats not the main issue.  Its unreliability.

Integrating a small portion of renewables affordably is very doable.  Integrating a large amount (40% +) is challenging.  100% is very difficult.

Renewables suffer from short-term intermittency, which storage is a promising solution to.  But renewables suffer from seasonal changes, that's the real challenge.  Some nations have hydro or geothermal they can use to balance it.  Nuclear is the most likely solution for those that don't.

	<TEXT> Okay, so I see 2 ways you're taking this argument, but neither makes much sense.

1) That renewables produce far less energy for the same investment, and must less Gwh less jobs are produced.  [This still is not true](https://web.stanford.edu/group/emf-research/docs/occasional_papers/OP64.pdf).  That research from Stanford indicates that 1 Gwh of solar PV produces between 0.846 and 1.205 jobs.  Wind produces between 0.081 to 0.318.  Natural gas produces 0.108 and coal 0.115.

2) That it produces much cheaper electricity which creates jobs elsewhere.  On its face, that is [not significantly true](  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source), but it depends who you go by.  The EIA says wind and natural gas are roughly equal (natural gas slightly ahead), and solar is slightly more.  Lazard says wind and solar are both slightly less than natural gas on the other hand.  Either way, that doesn't really hold up.

Even if we use the more favorable numbers for natural gas that gives it a slight edge, it's pretty clear that the [economic damage from emissions and pollution](http://time.com/4082328/climate-change-economic-impact/) would cancel out any gains.

It is debatable.  Some countries are actually phasing nuclear out; nuclear's future is very much up in the air.  I'm not anti-nuclear by any means and I would prefer it any day to natural gas, this is just reality.

By saying "it has a future" you're relying on us being unable to economically balance an all-renewable grid.  That is not a sure thing in the slightest.  I'm not saying it *doesn't* have a future, because no one knows.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to note, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), has said it does not classify nuclear as a renewable resource.

The US Department of Energy [also does not classify](http://sciencing.com/nuclear-energy-renewable-nonrenewable-4579290.html) nuclear as renewable.

That's the two biggest authorities in the world classifying it as non-renewable.  There is an argument to be made that it is renewable, but it is one that has very little backing internationally.

That isn't to say anything bad about nuclear or even  suggest the supply is in danger of running out.  But let's not go re-writing the accepted facts to fit what we feel because we wish we could call it renewable.  It is not accepted to be classified as a renewable resource. </TEXT>

But it certainly isn't trending in the right direction, in America at least.  The US added [1.1 GW of nuclear capacity in 2016](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=25172).  Along with 6.8 GW of wind, 8.0 of natural gas, and 9.5 of solar.  That 1.1 GW was in the form of one reactor, the first and only brought online in 20 years.


Meanwhile, they've retired 5 GW of nuclear in the past [4 years alone](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30112).

The reason for this is pretty simple: [price](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source?wprov=sfla1).  Wind, solar, and natural gas are all significantly cheaper on average.

So right now things don't look good for nuclear.  But nuclear has the huge advantage of being dispatchable over solar and wind.  And in the future, that could bring nuclear to the forefront.

But thats an iffy 'could'.  Unless things change, nuclear will be required for deep decarbonization of the grid.  But deep decarbonization is still some time away.  And it all depends what happens until that time.  A lot of factors will play in: costs, load balancing, new technology, storage, among other things.

So it's not out of the question to say nuclear has no long-term future.  Its highly debatable, but not surely false.  It all depends on what happens in the coming years, so unless someone has a crystal ball, I don't think any of us can say what nuclears long-term future looks like.  It may play a large role, a smaller one, or no role at all.

	<TEXT> The carbon tax is a *far* more efficient solution than subsidies.  Fix everything?  No.  But a carbon tax/cap and trade is pretty much proven to be the best solution.  Econonmists are [on board with it](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/04/consensus-of-economists-cut-carbon-pollution).  Studies are [in line with it](http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/carbon-taxes-and-emissions-trading-are-cheapest-ways-of-reducing-co2.htm).  

You still need other things to combine with the carbon tax.  Regulations mainly to account for other emissions as well.  Certain, targeted or specialized subsidies might be useful too.  But a carbon tax or cap and trade is an essential foundation for any climate policy.

China, all of the EU, India, and Canada have all adopted one at this point. </TEXT>

Given that they were treated very well, they had an opportunity to go out into communities, work, meet people, and form very close relationships with the the farmers they worked with it's not crazy to say that they honestly saw a life in Canada.

A much smaller portion [of America's POWs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_prisoners_of_war_in_the_United_States) chose to live in America, but even then it says most of them left with very positive feelings of the country.  One POW commented that "I've yet to meet a German prisoner who doesn't tell me that it was the time of their lives.".  

So given all that, I guess I would say do you have evidence to the contrary that they simply tried to stay because they didn't want to go back to a desolate Germany? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe far in the future, but not anywhere near this level. 

The US has [6.5% of intermittent renewable sources](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427 t=3) (wind   solar).

Here are some other countries for comparison:

[Germany](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-energy-consumption-and-power-mix-charts): 17.8%

[Denmark](http://www.energinet.dk/EN/KLIMA-OG-MILJOE/Miljoerapportering/Elproduktion-i-Danmark/Sider/Elproduktion-i-Danmark.aspx): 53.2%

[Portugal](https://www.iea.org/media/countries/Portugal.pdf): 25%

[Ireland](https://www.iea.org/media/countries/Ireland.pdf): 23%

[Sweden](https://www.iea.org/media/countries/Sweden.pdf): 10%

[Spain](https://www.iea.org/media/countries/Spain.pdf): 23%

[United Kingdom](https://www.iea.org/media/countries/UnitedKingdom.pdf): 14%

[Greece](https://www.iea.org/media/countries/Greece.pdf): 17%

[Austria](https://www.iea.org/media/countries/Austria.pdf): 10%

You could quite easily double the share of intermittent sources with few issues at all.  If you rely on intermittent renewables for a high percentage of your electricity mix, then sure, you might be in trouble if you don't properly balance them somehow.  But at the level the US is at destabilization is not a serious issue of any kind.

You might has well conduct a study on the threat of a penguin invasion at this point in time. </TEXT>

No, of course not.  It only represents current cost.  If demand in the future increases, it will reflect the increase in price at that point if it does in fact increase prices.

No, emissions/indirect costs are never reflected in these analysis.  The same way that LCOE costs don't calculate the cost of damage from fossil fuel sources.   </TEXT>

I don't know what chart you were looking at in the study, but it seems pretty cut and dry to me.

EDIT: Were you looking at total number of storms?  If so, that would make sense.  The study indicated the intensity of storms increased, not the number.

First of all, do you have any evidence they aren't increasing?  I can't find any data either way.

Secondly, there is a lot more factors to it than that.  Way more considerations also go into pricing.  For example, buildings are also getting sturdier and safer.  That brings costs down.  There could be 100 explanations. </TEXT>
