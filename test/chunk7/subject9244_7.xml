I was watching a PBS NewsHour clip yesterday *very* soon after it was uploaded, and Trump/Russia trolls had already pissed in the comments section (I think theirs were the vast majority of the few comments at that time). This on a wonky channel that doesn't get a lot of traffic, relatively. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, if he goes before day-3 I'll be surprised. Aaron Colvin is a decent comp; he went mid-4, though wasn't as highly regarded as Jones to begin with. Still, an achilles for a position like corner is no joke. Add to that you're essentially punting an entire year from a 4-year rookie contract, and that has to be a big discount.

P.S. Jones is also coming off a relatively sub-par combine performance, while a lot of his peers knocked it out of the park. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If we're really going to entertain PFF grades...Warford and Swanson's grades were within a tiny 0.5 points of each other; I'd hardly say one would qualify as "decently better" in that case. When put in context, however, Larry had the 20th-best guard grade overall -- out of 64 starting guards -- while Swanson had the 17th-highest center grade out of 32 starting centers. That would firmly put Larry in the upper-third of starting guards (69th-percentile) while Swanson would fail not make the upper-half of starting centers (47th-percentile). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disagree on Swanson  Warford. There's a reason Larry just got $8.5MM/year; he's a darn good player. Swanson got a lot of pub last season because he improved significantly over a terrible start to his career prior to that (the Lions drafted Glasgow in the 3rd-round in part to replace him), but I'd argue he was at best an average-level starting center. *At best*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In its sprawl, in its empathy for characters from all social spheres, and in its political fury, the new season may be the closest thing Ive seen to *The Wire*. Thats never a comparison to be thrown around lightly  and *The Wire*, with its police procedural spine, its action and suspense, and its abundant dark humor, was a far more fun and purely entertaining show than the relentlessly sober-minded *American Crime* has any interest in being(*)  but as I watched the new episodes deftly bring its many stories together with as much righteous anger as artistry, I felt a tingle in a part of my brain that has largely laid dormant since my days as a TV tourist in West Baltimore.
 
 *(***) Lately, when one of my reviews complains that a new series is humorless, people will ask me why I think comedy should be considered a mandatory ingredient of an otherwise dramatic program. I tell them I dont think that, but that if theres not some kind of humor, or lightness, then the execution of all the utterly serious material has to be so good that Im willing to wallow in the misery along with the characters. Few shows are well-crafted enough to clear that high bar;* American Crime *soars over it.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right or not it's the only source of TV news I actively consume, and has been for a while. Sometimes it's nice to not have to worry about curation and just fall back into an old reliable like *NewsHour*.

Also, the YouTube streaming/uploads has been a huge plus since that started relatively recently. Via YouTube, podcast, traditional broadcast -- it's super-easy to access whenever convenient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's complicated.

One one hand, he's clearly not the same player physically that he was even last season. How much, if at all, will he rebound next season? We don't know. Maybe he's done, maybe he'll go back to '15-'16 Reggie.

His attitude does seem pretty good overall this year, especially once this deep slump solidified, but his teammates still don't like him. That's evident. At least, on the court. It probably has to do with Reggie's style of play rather than his character, but it is what it is, still. Even ideal-Reggie isn't the most fun PG to play with: he pounds ball, is a bad passer, etc. It's why I think his admittedly-good box score numbers when he's going well bely a game that isn't the most impactful on a team level; there's a ceiling there that's lower than some Pistons fans assume. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Ish finishing games instead of Reggie is much more important than who starts.

Another thing to keep in mind -- and Dan Feldman has pointed this out on his Pistons podcast -- is that starting Ish should allow him to play his increasingly larger share of minutes over a longer period: 48min, instead of 39-40 or so. Right now he is at times having to play 15min-straight stretches to end games, for instance. And Smith is quite the high-effort player. </TEXT>
