Colonization was a good thing for Africa, for the most part. They've regressed massively since the West left.

says discrimination doesn't exist anymore,

Not legally.

says Japan is the gold standard for racial purity, 

If you're into racial homogeneity it is. I don't really care either way but I don't see a problem with saying that.

says rich blacks commit more crimes than poor whites, 

That is factually correct.

If I don't search your history, I call you a liberal as a kneejerk reaction. If I do, I'm unclassy. You just can't win.

 just so you know liberalism has nothing to do with "wanting more government spending."

I know, political science was one of my majors. Since you're a Romanian, liberalism actually does mean liberalism in your country. In the USA, we use "liberal" to mean essentially "social democrat", and since Reddit is a primarily American site which is uneducated in political science (durr guys Bernie is a socialist), I use liberal in the colloquial sense rather than its proper sense.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only Founding Father to be an atheist was Thomas Paine, and it's arguable whether or not he even is one. While many of the others were deists and critical of traditional religion, they were all devout in some sense. John Jay even said that if America ever lost its Christian religion, it would fall.

Albert Einstein, while also critical of religion, was a pantheist.

Galileo was, and I quote, a "genuinely pious Roman Catholic".

The other two listed, Dawkins and Harris, pretty much made their careers by being anti-theists.

There is not a single atheist on this list with any true accomplishments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there any evidence any of those people were Trump supporters? None of them stated that they were motivated by Trump. The Canadians could't even vote for Trump. 

Note that there were also only 6 of them. More Islamic terrorist attacks are carried out *each day* than that. 

You also completely failed to respond, because you have a script you think is clever and you lack the creativity to deviate from it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While it is embarrassing, I think the entire term political capital is absurd. Politicians and journalists make a big deal of political theater, but to the average man on the street, it doesnt matter a whit. There is no such thing as political capital, only votes. And Trump still has enough votes to pass legislation. </TEXT>

Secondly, we voted for him on the basis of shared concerns - not shared values.

	<TEXT> He's not Muslim though. His religion is kind of an enigma. In some of his episodes he's mentioned owning a Holy Bible, but he clearly adheres to Brobology in the Takeshi's Challenge video when he eats grilled Mormons and then consults his Broble to realize he shouldn't have. In his "Christmas with the Kranks" video he meets Allah, which is probably a joke about his Iranian origins. 

But ultimately, I'd probably say he's... ECHnostic

Edit: Actually he says [here](https://www.facebook.com/JonTronShow/posts/329884473694656) that he is an atheist or agnostic. I'm fake news. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll be glad to give a more detailed response later, but most importantly is the fact that a permanent underclass never developed due to social mobility and that living conditions have been steadily increasing for everyone, of all classes. Also notable is that Marx's belief in the "inevitability of socialism" has been proven utterly wrong by the collapse of socialist countries and the socialist ideology being largely discredited; dialectical materialism was torn apart by Ludwig von Mises, as all things are the results of human action, not some vague movement of history. 

Also, if you're tired of hearing "I used to be a commie", maybe it's because so many of us simply used to be communist. I was a Marxist-Leninist, anarcho-communist, De Leonist, and democratic socialist at various points, slowly drifting rightward.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jesus set out to found his own religion, though. He claimed himself to be the Son of God. he claimed himself to be fulfilling the law and teaching new ones.

Mr. Rogers never preached anything like that. It's not only disrespectful to him, it's pretty much willfully insane. </TEXT>
