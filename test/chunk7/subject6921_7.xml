	<TEXT> College: I graduated HS in 2012 and had no idea what i wanted to do. Ended up doing like 3 semester and flunking my 4th because I wasn't motivated. If i could go back i would just finished an associates degree like everyone told me too because now that I know what i want I have to finished my associates degree. Everything is much harder now; bills, responsibilities, no financial support, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I'm 24, no I'm not 17. Here you want to see my license. Yes I can drive, no I dont live with my parents, and no I graduated high school years ago (and yes I need full-time, i can work day shifts). I don't know why but being a guy I f-ing hate looking so much younger. people generally don't respect you as much and the only girls that give you attention are 6+ years younger.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two things. 

1. I have  glaucoma and im 24, diagnosed at 18. I have to take eye drops twice a day. So the problem
Is my eyes are really sensitive. Nothing helps,. So the eyes drops make my eyes blood red 24/7. Coworkers, bosses,etc are always questioning me. I've never smoked pot in my life and I'm tired of being judged and questioned on it. Plus when I say I have glaucoma less then half believe me.

2. Ok, I'm 24 male who looks 17. I get asked which grade I'm in high school or if I'm old enough to sell alcohol, etc. I get asked every day things like "you drive?!" or "what's ur mom making for supper?" haha  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that anyone involved in created or raping a child should have life or death. If you where referring to my cousin having life or death then thats extreme and cruel. Yes I'm glad they caught him, he was going down a spiral that could've ended very badly. There is no telling what he might of ended up doing years down if he wasn't caught. Im for a sentence, but for a shorter one with good rehabilitation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well like someone said earlier, You get added sentence based on how much you have. 15 years because he had a lot. He definitely wasn't creating CP, and very sure he wasn't selling it.
