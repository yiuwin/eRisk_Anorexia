	<TEXT> I'm not exactly sure where to post this, but I was wondering if other women experience this and if it's a cause for concern.  I'm mainly a runner (40 mpw), but I'm also lifting three times a week and playing in a recreational basketball league.  The point being, I'm pretty active.

I've lost 15-20 lbs since July down to a bmi of about 18.5 so I am of a normal weight.  I've never had my body fat tested, but I'm fairly vascular with well defined abs so it's probably pretty low.  I track my calories with myfitnesspal and eat really healthy and balanced. 

Do I have to gain weight and fat and ruin my progress to physique to be truly healthy?  I'm so nervous about accidentally overeating or eating junk food for calories.  Has anyone else been faced with a similar situation? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a bmi of about 18.5 down from 21 or so.  I've been slowly over the course of 6ish months losing the weight through copious running and moderate restriction.  I've gotten to the point that I am nearing underweight, and I have lost my period.  I know I need to stop losing weight, but I count my calories with MyFitnessPal, and I'm can't stop aiming to keep my intake numbers below my daily goal.  I also am starting to really like how my body looks- slim and muscular, and I'm afraid putting on a few pounds will ruin it.  When I do eat my fill, I feel horrible and guilty even though my "mini binges" are usually an extra handful of nuts- something I know logically to be healthy.  Something here has to give.  I'm sorry for the rambling, I just don't know where to go from here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a fan of "A HIIT Interval Timer".  Not the most creative namr but easy to customize and it gets the job done. </TEXT>
