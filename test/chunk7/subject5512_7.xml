	<TEXT> Good point- Fate 06 is supposedly not as good. I do recommend he check out the visual novel though at some point too, since it's pretty good stuff, not to mention it does have the proper Fate route adaptation as well as the to-be-adapted Heaven's Feel route if he can't wait so long. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He'll need to watch the other parts of the Fate series too: he'll need to watch fate/stay night, then Unlimited Blade Works, THEN Zero. Or he can read through the 3 Visual Novel routes then Zero.

From my understanding that's probably the best way, since apparently Zero spoils lots of things from the series it takes place before and will probably leave him pretty confused. </TEXT>
