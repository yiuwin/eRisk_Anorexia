	<TEXT> Jimmy Carter did a very similar thing to Iranians back when he was president. He banned Iranians from entering the country during the Iranian hostage crisis. Here's an excerpt from his speech:

Fourth, the Secretary of Treasury [State] and the Attorney General will invalidate all visas issued to Iranian citizens for future entry into the United States, effective today. We will not reissue visas, nor will we issue new visas, except for compelling and proven humanitarian reasons or where the national interest of our own country requires. This directive will be interpreted very strictly.

This type of thing happens. Trump isn't the first one to do this and he won't be the last.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The left has a very vague oppression Olympics that they like to put each type of person through. This is how it's kind of structured from what I can tell.

#TOP ROW
**There are the gold medalists in the oppression Olympics. These groups are not to be criticized EVER and doing so will automatically make you a racist/sexist/homophobe/xenophobic bigot.**
-Muslims
-Mexicans
-Transgenders*

*Only applies to liberal groups of this type, any conservative is deemed a racist

#Middle Row
**These are the groups that have been put through the ringer. Most of them have been milked for all of their political value, but still can squeeze some out of them**
-Anyone pro-choice
-Black women
-Gays and lesbians 
-Feminists

#Bottom Row
**Political capital is mostly used up. These groups are low on the oppression mobile.**
-Any ethnic minority besides the ones in the top 2 rows
-Black men
-Mentally and physically challenged 

#Scum of the Earth
**These are groups that are to be persecuted and deemed unworthy**
-White Males
-Jews
-Anyone conservative (regardless of other rows)
-Anyone that supports Trump
-Christians

	<TEXT> But the other 94% wouldn't suffer because health insurance would be insanely more affordable. The healthy don't have to pay for the very sick. If someone gets sick then yea the money is there, but they aren't inherently paying for the 6% to begin with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But the 6% is the most costly patients. It might not seem like a lot, but in $ amount it is a lot. Sorry not every American wants our taxes to go up 8% to pay for everyone's health insurance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Paying for 6% of people with preexisting conditions sounds like protecting preexisting conditions to me.  Not saying it's perfect but it's certainly not garbage. Taking the high priced patients out of the system will certainly drive prices down without compromising care.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure why you are being downvoted, but you bring up a good point. However, Mexico doesn't have enough leverage to call our bluffs. 30% of Mexico's economy relies on exports to the United States. We buy a lot of their goods. Our exports to Mexico make up 0.5% of our economy. There isn't really an instance where Mexico calling our bluff would benefit them as a country.  They can deny it all they want and try to stand up to Trump, but they don't have either the economical or political capital to do such a thing.  </TEXT>
