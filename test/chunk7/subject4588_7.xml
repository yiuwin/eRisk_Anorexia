	<TEXT> Hi r/personalfinance!

A bit about myself for context: I am a 23 year old grad student in California. Having now made a sustainable life on my own, I am now thinking about ways to establish creditworthiness. Hence I want to get a credit card.

There are a couple of factors that should affect my decision, though I don't know how much. First, all of my immediate family are on the east coast, and second, I am an academic so I think I need a card that will grant me airline miles or just savings on flights generally. I appreciate any tips that will get me on the right direction in getting a credit card that not only will not screw me over, but also be useful for the things that are important for me.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>
