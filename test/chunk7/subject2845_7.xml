	<TEXT> This was talking about a school in which the students wanted to make their prom integrated. I was under the impression that neither party (white students/students of color)  besides the school board wished for segregation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worded that somewhat improperly. I meant to say unwanted segregation. I don't think that anybody should be told they can't integrate with a certain culture or sex or anything when neither party has a problem with it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just say that because I am very fair skinned and too, have many more freckles than the op. I personally think that what you are born with looks the best on you. I covered mine up for years and years and years and now I regret that because I feel beautiful while showing them off. I apologize if I sounded forceful, I just know there's usually more pressure to cover them than to not. </TEXT>
