	<TEXT> maybe they'll include a lot of the historical parts of the story in the second part since its mostly from Mikes research that we learn about Pennywise being in Derry forever. That would definitely add to the run time and its part of the story that have never been adapted </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Palpatine has a good reason IMO. The Sith are the enemy of the Jedi and his goal as a Sith was to destroy them and rule the galaxy. In a universe thats not already established it would be fine for Snoke to be just this evil entity but this is a continuation of a story. When I say good reason I mean not just a character that exists to be the bad guy but a character that has a reason to be there as part of a threaded storyline. He doesn't have to be related to or be a character we know from the previous movies but hopefully his motives will be rooted in a situation or incident from the past films. I.E. The Clone Wars, fall of the Republic, the Rebellion..etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree and I misused the term "playing it for laughs" I just meant that DW's reading was more of playful life lesson and the audience was reacting to that, whereas JEJ was reading it as a no holds barred statement of fact.

	<TEXT> its amazing! if you watch the clip of Denzel doing the same scene they play it in completely different way. JEJ is so much more stoic and stern while DW plays it almost for laughs. I prefer the JEJ way because having read the play i feel thats emotion the playright was trying to evoke in the words.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So on the Facebook group "Stephen King Collectors" someone gave away doubles of 2 Stephen King books he had in a contest. All you had to do was post a pic of your Stephen king collection and there was a random drawing for the winner. Well needless to say I won one of the books a 3rd edition of Skeleton Crew.
