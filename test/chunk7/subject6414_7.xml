	<TEXT> Your not a coward and your not weak. You've had to deal with a toxic relationship with your parent. Parents should be there for their children, not to cut them down.

But please don't kill yourself. Even if your mom never believed in you, your friends did. Friendship is very powerful, and sometimes means more than blood relations. Why not try and prove her wrong? Why not become successful and achieve your dreams and show your mother that you are not worthless, but a valuable human being who doesn't need her hate and toxicity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hobbies are meant to be activties you enjoy. If you don't enjoy art, I don't think there's any reason to keep doing it. Still, are you drawing for fun or because your hoping to make it a career? If your doing because you enjoy it, who cares what other people say, or how you compare to others. If your doing it as a career, well, I know it's a tough business! While I only know so much about the art business, I do know a family friend who actually published a book on traditional art/sketches. So it's definetly not a worse less form of art or outdated. I draw sketches myself, and I'd be happy to compare our works if you want (I'm not that great though).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm surprised how much this resonated with me, how much this reminded me of my life. I've had friends betray and use me, treating me worse than the third wheel. The part about not ever thinking I will experience love is something I use to think and believe. So many times I've just wanted a shoulder to lie my head on, someone to hug. I've yet to have these wishes of mine fulfilled. Ive felt the emptiness and hollowness. Maybe I'm living a fool' dream, but there are billions of people on this earth, so I hold out hope that maybe just one them might love and understand me. 

The people who hurt you and used you are terrible people. I've had people, "friends" leave me out or try and take advantage of me. This of course just made me more lonely than ever. I personally found it helpful to leave these people, as they only drag you down. No one deserves to be used and betrayed like that. 

Still, I don't think you should end your life. To die takes a certain amount of courage; choosing to live, even more so. There are people and communities out there that can and want to help you. Of course I'd be happy to talk to you as well, anytime.

	<TEXT> As s teenager who has gone through depression, loneliness, and suicidal thoughts, I can understand to some extent what your going through. Yes, living can feel unbearable, and suicide might seem like the only way out. I thought so too. 

Thing is, it's not. My tenacity payed off and things got better. I'm still struggling of course, and my life is nowhere near perfect, but I've found meaning in this pain. It took work and commitment, but life became just a little more bearable. There are people out there who can and want to help you. And of course you can talk to me whenever you want. I would it mean a lot to me, having gone through what you have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, I can understand what your going through. The feeling that no one cares for me is something I've felt all my life. In 1st grade I was the one kid who sat on the bench alone while everyone else played and had fun. Things have gotten a little better, sure, but I still don't feel anyone really cares about me. So please, don't go. I do understand, being there myself. Maybe we can talk, help each other out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe you shouldn't abandon public education, till ya learn your grammar! Jokes aside, just because public education teaches that masterbation is healthy, does not mean we should throw the whole system under the bus. The mainstream view is that porn is healthy, and public education should not be blamed for this.

That said I personally wish my health teachers would have warned me about PMO addiction, and the side effects that come with it. Teachers should at least make students aware of possible side effects and what have you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Benefits come being proactive, not passive. Abstaining from PMO gives you time and energy (and other things as well), so start improving the things you want to be better in. Want to look more attractive, be more social, or get better grades? You have to actually practice at those things, not wait for benefits to just fall into your lap.

If you are being proactive, and still not seeing benefits, then just give it more time. Changes are a lengthy process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, PMO addiction works just like this. At first I was satisfied with just watching porn. Then I started to actual fap. But after a while the videos I used weren't enough, so I found new ones. But then "normal" videos weren't enough so I looked for videos that were violent/forced. If I didn't start NoFap, I would have started looking for even worse things for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, I think I better understand your position. And while I see that the animal part of our brain might override our rational part in suicide, I'm not convinced that this is the case always. 

I say this because our prefrontal cortex does (can) control our limbic system [1]. Of course it takes effort, but it is possible. And while our animal part of our brain might always act for survival, I'm not convinced that the other parts of our brain work this way. 

Still, I don't think this takes away from your message that we should work with our limbic system, not vilify it. But part of working with it means controlling it and not letting take over, if you will.

	<TEXT> Accept you can overcome anxiety and depression. It takes time and effort, but it's definetly possible. Look, embracing the fact we experience pain and suffering is one thing. Making that your reality is just stupid and self destructive.

I use to think like you do, thinking that I should embrace my suffering and loneliness, make it my reality. Trust me, there's no happiness in such a path. In many ways, it's the easy way out: Why try and cure my anxiety and depression? Why not just give in and accept this is who I am? Instead of fixing the problem, you just give up. 

To sum up, embracing pain is one thing, making it your reality is another. If you mean the latter, your advice is harmful and wrong. If you mean the former, you should change your language to clarify. </TEXT>
