	<TEXT> Awesome website. Great for a newbie like me. Also, as a UX designer, I like that its has a clean feel to it. Very easy to read, the green bar at the bottom is also a nice touch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats! Just curious, do you have type 1 or type 2? My partner has type 1.5, that was late onset diabetes. She's not overweight, but I think keto might help both of us.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, he's pretty expensive. However, he happens to be a friend of my sisters. He said he would fit what my budget is. :)

You are right though. I'd rather spend the money on our trip, than a ring! What is the general opinion on manmade diamonds?

Are the ring prices you are mentioning, prices in the US? I'm in Australia, and things seem a bit more expensive here :(   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I think you are the 10th person to recommend me getting a food scale, so I think I will have to invest in one. Logging can be hard when I'm guessing how much I'm eating. I like that I can scan the packets of things, but when I make a salad myself, or a meal myself, its a lot hard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She is definitely a classic kinda gal. I really want to pick up an antique looking ring, or get one made. Her hands are small. I also want something ethically sourced. I have been looking at [Rose and Crown](http://roseandcrownjewellers.com/) because I love his style. Thank you for all that info. I have so much research to do! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know the answer, but I'm in the same boat. My PT wants me to do some cardio with my strength training, just to bring up my fitness levels. I have noticed that I'm not actually losing much weight, but I am feeling stronger. I am losing cm around my waist though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hello! There is 30kg standing between me and asking my partner to marry me. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My stats. 31F, H: 160cm (5'2) SW: 90kg(198lbs) CW: 88kg (194lbs) GW: 60kg (132lb).

I've been overweight for about 10 years now. Completely my fault. I ate and ate and over-ate bad food. I've been on and off trying to lose it for years. Never been able to do it. I was pretty poor, unmotivated, working in a shitty retail job, in terrible relationships because I didn't feel like I deserved more.

2 years ago, I joined a soccer team. I use to love to play back in high school, and figured it'd be a good way to get back into fitness. There on that that field at the first practice, I noticed this beautiful woman. She had the most amazing blue eyes I had ever seen. She got her foot to the ball and immediately fell over. I totally fell in love. Fast forward a few months and we were madly into each other. She encouraged me to finish my degree, apply for a better job which she tirelessly practiced interviews with me for. I got a job that paid 3 times my retail wage, in my field. A job that I was inspired to come to every day.

She's known since she met me that I was uncomfortable with my body. She said she's always loved me, no matter what I look like. But she deserves a strong woman, who is confident. That's who I want to become. I know that she's the person I want to marry. But I want her to marry the best me.

So onto my journey. To be fit, to go on a big 6 month journey in 2018, to literally climb mountains. To get to a peak and ask her to marry me.

This year is the year. Ive started to eat properly since December 2016. I started the gym and personal training on Jan 10th. I measured, took pictures and I'm already feeling good about myself. I want to keep this up, lose the weight, build the muscle.

Any tips of buying an engagement ring?

Edit: pic for context. Me on the right https://i.imgur.com/4tZYMdd.jpg

Tl;dr: Am fat and unhealthy, will ask girlfriend to marry me when I feel confident and fit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah i have noticed I haven't dropped heaps of weight like other people have at this size. I'm not doing as much cardio (yet) until soccer season starts. I did measure myself and have noticed that I am slightly smaller, so that's always a plus! I'm trying not to focus on that number. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gosh, what a detailed response, thank you! I didn't expect such great replies! Sorry, I should have been more specific in what I have already been doing (see the reply to the person below). I probably should also clarify, I'm female, 31 years old, and weight about 88kg (thats roughly 200 pounds I think).

I've been eating a lot better, and I'm seeing results from that. Slowly, but surely, losing some weight. I want to get stronger, and so I am going to my personal trainer once a week, and attempting to go an extra two times a week. I manage the one extra time, but the third time has been hard, with work, and motivation. If I go 2 times a week, will I still see the results, or will it take a lot longer?

If I put in that extra 45 mins a week, will it shave weeks off seeing those results and getting stronger? I know everything takes time, I'm willing to do it. I just want to be realistic too, and make sure I can continue on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your reply. I probably should have added that I started with the eating heathy/MFP since December, and joined the gym in early Jan. I've been trying to stay under 1650 cal a day, and so far, its been going well. (Doc and nutritionist both told me thats the safest way to do it, long term, and to keep it off). I'm eating high protein, low carb and low sugar diet. I may look at getting a scale for my food. Thanks :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How many times a week should I go to the gym? If I'm serious about losing weight, gaining muscle and feeling healthy, and wanting to do that and see results in the next 6 months, realistically, should I be going 3 times a week?  </TEXT>
