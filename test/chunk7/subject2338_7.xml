	<TEXT> I found her to be pretty deplorable too. 
It's likely that she released the tapes,and I find that to be pretty shitty too. I don't think she should be praised for ANYTHING at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alrighty,so I've recently began considering working at a strip club. I'm a college student,living on my own,not making tons of money,and I'm just kicking around the idea.
What are your thoughts on strip clubs and stripping in general? I've always considered it to be bad idea at best,and degrading at worst. But I'm just wondering,what are your thoughts on strips clubs? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not politically savvy anymore,but I do know that this is a conservative think tank.
Does that have anything to do with anything?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's a weird eating disorder thing of mine.
I was really anorexic for a long time,and right now I'm a bit healthier than I've been in like 6 years.
The feeling of having food or liquids in my stomach freaks me out SO much. 
I used to only allow myself 8ounces of water a day,in order to keep my weight down.
Now I can drink like 36 ounces of coffee,as long as it's spread out throughout the day,but even then,I sometimes only drink 12 ounces daily.
It's a pain in the ass,and clearly effecting my running abilities,but I'm working on it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if I'm the type of High School dropout that you're referring to,but I left public high school my sophomore year of high school due to  mental illness.

I began homeschooling,where I essentially taught myself,but I would take Chapters Tests and Finals,that were sent to my homeschooling provider,who would grade and send them back.
Throughout High school, my older attorney friend and I published an article for a country wide magazine,I was able to work on a lot of other extra curricular things and have a job as well.

I did end up getting my GED immediately,just in case colleges didn't recognize my homeschooling(most do,but just in case)and I'm now in college. My high school experience really had no impact on college or life now. Doing adult things like teaching myself in high school,actually helped in college. 

All of my girl friends thought that i was throwing my life away by leaving public high school,but I'm doing fine. I have a good job,a full ride scholarship for college,plans for law school,and basically life is okay. </TEXT>
