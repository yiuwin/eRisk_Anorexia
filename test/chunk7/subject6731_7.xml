	<TEXT> Labels. I only have psychedelics. Wouldn't touch the rest of these RCs if you paid me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tried maybe 3mg before and got nothing.

I'd recommend taking 9-12mg. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Vaporizing 4-subs </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I have attempted two times to vaporize 4-sub tryptamines. First time was 4-AcO-DMT and there was a definite effect, perhaps a +++, with around 25mg. Used a torch and freebase pipe. 

That was a few months ago. The other day I noticed on both Erowid and PsychonautWiki the claim that you can smoke 4-HO-MET, so I decided to have a test run with 4-HO-DET. Same procedure as last time. Taste was TERRIBLE. Tenfold more disgusting than any DMT analog. Effects were imperceptible.

So it would seem that 4-HO-DET cannot be vaporized. I shall try again with another, probably 4-HO-MET, and see what happens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, that is HPPD alright. At least, in my experience. I usually only get it after a DMT analogs binge and after taking a toke. 

After taking DPT and MET a few times each within about two weeks, I would notice after a large toke that the carpet in my living room had turned into a TV. That is, it was like I was watching a cartoon from all the shapes and morphing going on with the carpet as the screen. It was quite intense, and rather enjoyable; I actually skipped watching Game of Thrones just to watch the carpet. Then, after maybe three days of this I went into a trance, just like my insufflated DPT trip, and then ever since coming to 45 minutes later I have not had a recurrence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am very excited for this one, not so much for any reason inherent within the molecule itself, but rather simply because of its discovery: Albert Hofmann first created it in the 1950s. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just acquired some too. Plan on trying ~20mg in the next couple days, as soon as the weather clears up enough for me to walk wherever the substance takes me without having to worry about getting covered in mud. </TEXT>
