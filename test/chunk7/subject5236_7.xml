	<TEXT> The divorce was absolutely heart breaking. I was 12 and it was the summer after 7th grade when my brother and I were told. The divorce was civil and my parents are excellent co-parents and are friends. Despite the civility of the whole thing, I put up walls around me which really fucked up my social life and academic life as well. I have since worked really hard to break down those walls and have made a decent social circle with whom I can go to for anything. My relationship with my dad sucked because of the walls I put up, but is doing much better now. I'm a senior in high school now, my mom just got married to an incredible man who I love to death and trust and I recognize that the divorce was in the best interest of everybody. In the words of Louis CK "Divorce is always good news". </TEXT>
