As a consultant, I'm writing designs (whether it's in an email or document) about 25% of the time, and I would say that makes the difference between a good developer and a great one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Locking your knees while standing at the altar is a nervous habit that can end up in "groom down". Keep 'em loose.
2. You are probably not very comfortable in front of a camera, so try and forget there is a photographer around. Assume the photographer does NOT want "look here and smile" unless they ask you do do that. Focus on each other while being posed and you can't go wrong.
3. You need to intentionally LEAVE the reception at a certain point and decide beforehand a cleanup crew that can deliver any extra stuff back to you. We ended up cleaning up after our own reception afterwards, not tons of fun.
4. You will be in front of people the whole day unless you intervene. Plan to have at least 5 minutes with your new spouse alone at some point after the ceremony, but don't wait until the end of the night. The day is about you, not the guests. Do allow your photographer to capture this (from a distance).
5. You might forget certain family members even exist while lining up for the formal family photos. Do yourself a favor and make a list of the family groupings you want for formal photos and give that to the photographer. Then the deciding is done ahead of time and you can just relax and smile. Photographer don't mind this, as long as you limit the list to just people, and not a scavenger hunt with "photos of the rings" and "dress and shoes" listed.

	<TEXT> I have worked at this place for 9 years, so I've become critical to their operation. Being a consulting firm, some employees live out of state, but none have been developers and none live in Hawaii. I just sat down with the owner yesterday, explained what I wanted to do, and I had already thought through all the possible objections and had a preliminary plan to ensure I was still productive and contributing. He was not real excited about it, but he did approve it and now we are making plans to move in a few months. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wife is a stay at home mom, but she may want to pursue education, so I believe Oahu is much better for that. We are including elementary school ratings in our search for a rental. Maui is another possibility, but we feel Oahu/Big Island have so much more to offer in terms of things to do/see. Buying is a possibility, but would need to feel good about staying at that house for 4-5 years for it to make sense, at least that's the conventional wisdom. We own a home in California which we may sell or rent out, not decided on that yet... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm aware of the pet regulations, I'm getting my pup's blood drawn this week to start the 120 day waiting period. We will probably not bring her on our "moving" trip, but rather in a subsequent trip back 2 months later (assuming we found pet-friendly housing). My salary will be at least $150k, my wife is a stay-at-home mom. I'm not sure what you mean by "living plans", we are currently planning to get an AirBNB / VRBO place for 2 weeks when we arrive as a base for apartment hunting, then hoping to rent a place for at least 6 months. If we really love it, we may purchase a property. </TEXT>
