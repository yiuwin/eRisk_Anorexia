	<TEXT> Honestly a large portion of Mass Effect 2. Never in my long gaming career have I cared so much and had such strong emotional feelings about characters in a game, to the point of being depressed when during the last part I lost some crew, I actually replayed until I had every single on of them survive, that is honestly the most relief I've  felt ever in a video game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In honor of the great Bill paxton I'm gonna have to go with his awesome character Pvt. Hudson in Aliens "I'm ready, man, check it out. I am the ultimate badass! State of the badass art! You do not wanna fuck with me. Check it out! Hey Ripley, don't worry. Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you! Check it out! Independently targeting particle beam phalanx. Vwap! Fry half a city with this puppy. We got tactical smart missiles, phased plasma pulse rifles, RPGs, we got sonic electronic ball breakers!" Some comedy but amazing quote. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My team already knew about this going in, we prepared with 2 mesas 1 rhino p and 1 octavia... I'll explain, my buddy and I as mesas situated ourselves on the tallest point on the map, with our peacemakers basically being as powerful a possible, max dmg boost from amp, rhino with strongest iron skin possible, running around trying to not die but keeping him occupied on the ground. Peacemaker from the height advantage would actually get a ton of decent shots on the jugg, we killed him in about 1 minute 30 seconds.  If anyone or any team is still struggling to kill this guy, I recommend this strategy it is highly effective </TEXT>
