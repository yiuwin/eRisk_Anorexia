	<TEXT> No. They fucked up on the Oscar nomination big time. Frankly I feel it's a movie worth an Oscar. 

 apparently they tried to squeeze in into the applicants list at the last second.  Made a quick dub and ran it at 1 theatre in the UK for 1 week. With no publicity. Hardly anyone watched it back then, as a reason and thus very few voted for it to even be nominated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them."

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, "OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?"

"No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it." So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

"Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!"

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

"No, no, just name anyone else," Dave says.

"President Obama," his boss quickly retorts.

"Yup," Dave says, "Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington," and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, "Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

"Pope Francis," his boss replies.

"Sure!" says Dave. "I've known the Pope for years." So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, "This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope." He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, "What happened?"

His boss looks up and says, "It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This LPT also helps while printing the said resume or any document for that matter.  PDF files keep the document formatting consistent across different platforms /operating systems. 

This really helps when you print, as the version of Office you may have used while making the document may differ from the system where you're printing, or even in cases where you're using a totally different word processor.  

Prints taken in such cases can end up being coming out as weirdly printed with the formatting style different from that you had.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> There was a farmer who had a horse and a goat </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> One day, the horse became very ill and he called the veterinarian, who said: "Well, your horse has a virus. He must take this medicine for three days. I'll come back on the 3rd day and if he's not better, we're going to have to put him to sleep."

Nearby, the goat listened closely to their conversation.

The next day, the Vet gave him the medicine and left.

The goat approached the horse and said:

"Be strong, friend. Get up or else they're going to put you to sleep!"

On the second day,  the doc again gave him the medicine and left.

The goat came back and said: - "Come on buddy, get up or else you're going to die! Come on, I'll help you get up".

Let's go! One, two, three... but the poor horse wouldn't get up!

On the third day, the Vet gave one look at the horse and said:

"Unfortunately, we're going to have to put him down tomorrow. Otherwise, the virus might spread and infect the other horses."

After they left, the goat approached the horse and said: "Listen pal, it's now or never! Get up, come on! Have courage! Come on! Get up! Get up! That's it, slowly! Great! Come on, one, two, three... Good, good. Now faster, come on...... Fantastic! Run, run more!

Yes! Yay! Yes! You did it, you're a champion!!!"

All of a sudden, the owner came back to the farm, saw the horse running on the field ... he was not aware of goats role in this. He began shouting: "It's a miracle! My horse is cured. We must have a Grand celebration...

Let's cook the goat!!!!"

	<TEXT> Valid concerns. 

Yes AMD chips used to run hot. With Ryzen however things have changed quite a bit and they are much cooler.  Like 65  on load at 4Ghz. Comparatively the i7 runs hotter because of its shitty TIM,  but then again it can overclock higher.  

The Ryzen 1700 seems to be the processor for you.  It's $ 329 msrp, iirc. Also they're was a deal few hours ago on rakuten which had it at 289. Keep an eye on r/buildapcsales. 

The difference between the 1700 and the 1800X is mainly their overclock potential. The 1700 hits 3.9GHz stable and the 1800X hits 4.1GHz stable. 

The 1700 comes with a stock RGB cooler in box unlike the 1800X. The stock wraith cooler is fairly quiet and can yet handle the 3.9GHz overclock. 

This will help you save on the cooler while keeping the same performance. Also, it's the X series processors that have the incorrect temperature sensor reporting problem(they add 20 degrees to the actual temperature) . The 1700 does not have it. 

This way you can probably put some cash towards that laptop. 

About high speed rams. There was a problem with them at launch.  Manufacturers ended up pulling mobos  from shelves. From what I understand bios updates are rolling in fast since it's a newer architecture. Also manufacturers have put out better and newer mobos and Higher speed rams are now supported.  And because of Ryzens infinity fabric thingy, you can benefit from the faster rams to get more performance. 

Microsoft is also working to optimize the Windows scheduler for Ryzen. So that will hopefully give some more performance gains. 

Overall, with the 1700 you should have a great multi purpose pc. With a good cost /performance ratio.

Let me know if you have any more questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mostly what others have said is correct.  Was that flash drive for a bios update or OS install by any chance? Does your mobo have a USB charging port for phones? Was the drive connected to that port? 

Another thing you can do is a bare bones test. Assuming you have your mobo box.  

Power everything off. 

Hold down the power button for 10sec.

Unplug and remove all power connections. 

Remove the mobo and the card from the case. 

I'm assuming you have your motherboard box.  Put your mobo (with the cpu, cooler and ram installated) on the box.  

Reconnect your PSU cables and check if it's turning on. (noting your previous replies, I'd say chances are low, but still) . 

If it turns on, yet and boot up to the bios.  Then switch off and try the same with the graphics card in. 

Most likely bad PSU, but then again worth a try. 

Also. If you have a Uninterrupted Power supply system, plug in your PSU to it and try instead of the direct wall plug. </TEXT>
