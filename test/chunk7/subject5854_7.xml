	<TEXT> Misery Loves Company, its a podcast that originally had Brennan (who honestly I just learned about a matter of months ago, he sort of just appeared and then started doing O J semi-regularly and showing up a lot of other places regularly) it had him and another comedian Lenny Marcus. Marcus left the podcast completely cause Brennan flies off the handle about everything and allegedly he acts the same way in real life and during phone calls/emails as he does on their podcast and Marcus got tired of it so he walked (off the air in between shows)

Then Brennan keeps the podcast going, starts rotating cohosts for a couple weeks, Martinez was coming in to fill that spot quite a few times so pretty much regularly, a few times it got a little heated between the two cause it was not like Marcus and Brennan (straight man angry man)  it was angry man vs angry man. 

Then the thread I posted in another comment here was the full meltdown of Martinez and Brennan over a phone call Brennan was making live on air to Martinez's agent

Tonight was the first night they were going to appear after that meltdown they were supposed to both be on LOS tonight but Brennan no-showed, Martinez started telling the story of what happened, Brennan then called in, the rest is in my post and I'll have a clip in a little bit if you wanted to see the followup. It's by no means the greatest radio event that's happened since Opie vs Jimmy We're not close, just some random meltdown drama between comedians, it's entertaining if you dont mind that radio drama type of stuff, I enjoy that stuff. Although if you dont recognize anyone involved at all and dont get entertained by the infighting of podcasts/shows etc it might not be  that entertaining </TEXT>

#[(Old) MLC Podcast: Released 12/12/16, recorded sometime last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w3ogNvEabw)

[Mirror #1](https://eroshare.com/b2icbcfb)


Full backstory for context:

Kevin Brennan hosts a podcast called Misery Loves Company (MLC). He rants and yells with some often brutal honesty about the comedy business, other comedians, clubs, club owners, pretty much anyone or anything. MLC has a small but dedicated following of people who see Kevin as a funny and compelling host, while others find him intensely abrasive, leading to the consensus that Brennan is more or less a loudmouth shit-stirrer. He's built a reputation for being great at putting on an entertaining show by being volatile and unpredictable. 

Kevin used to have a cohost named Lenny Marcus, who allegedly left the show because Brennan would constantly text and call Lenny, berating him about any given issue with the podcast or people involved with it and such. After leaving, it's been mentioned by some of Lenny's comedian friends on other shows/podcasts that Marcus went into MLC figuring Brennan's persona was somewhat of an act or a front for entertainment purposes. He came to realize there was no act being put on, and eventually quit MLC after getting burnt out dealing with Brennan's antics.

After Marcus left, Kevin started using a rotating handful of cohosts, one of which is this guy, Jimmy Martinez. Martinez has been active in NYC comedy but under the radar for quite awhile, [seemed to have had a friendship with Patrice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAox3WjOEPE), and is almost equally as loud and combative as Brennan is. I don't listen often but it seems that Martinez has been getting the lion's share of cohosting duties the past few weeks. Brennan and Martinez have already butted heads several times on air and discussions have gotten a little heated in the past few weeks but nothing like this level of totally breaking down. These two personalities doing a show together created a timebomb waiting to explode and this seems to be it.

 In the incident above, Kevin called up Jimmy Martinez's agent in the middle of a show after Martinez said he had been getting acting jobs in Hollywood through the agent. Kevin didn't believe him. Brennan asked the agent about Martinez's projects and if he had been cast officially anywhere. Brennan also took it further by unexpectedly spilling to the agent that Martinez goes on gambling benders for multiple days and then shows up to casting calls after being awake from partying all weekend. That was what seemed to trigger Martinez to lose his cool, he gets up to put his coat on and walk out on the show, but then he seems to snap. He beams Brennan with a lens cap from a camera, knocking Brennan's mic out of place. A confrontation takes place after and a woman who was the 3rd mic is caught in the middle of Brennan and Martinez. After shoving her chair out of the way and getting up in Brennan's face, Martinez angrily leaves the studio while Brennan, the cohost woman, and the off-camera producer guy are all left to figure out what happened and recompose themselves. All of this happens live on a YouTube video stream as you can see above. Originally this video had been removed after a brief window of being available on MLC's YouTube, but /u/Guinness525 recovered the clip, and about a day after he posted it on the subreddit, Riotcast uploaded a copy to their own YouTube channel.

----------------------------------------------------------------



#[(New) Legion of Skanks: 12/14/16 (9:30PM) -- LOS tries to mediate between Martinez and Brennan after Martinez's MLC meltdown](https://vimeo.com/195739151)

[Mirror #1](https://eroshare.com/i/9prfgrqd) // [#2](https://archive.org/download/brennanvsjimmy/brennanvsjimmy.mp4) // [#3](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x55ax87)

If you don't feel like hearing the buildup

* 18:15 -- they start playing the clip back from the MLC episode

* 26:50 -- Brennan calls in

Context --

It was supposed to be Martinez and Brennan both on Legion of Skanks tonight. However, the show starts and only Martinez is there. So they start recapping the whole incident and about 30 minutes into the podcast Kevin Brennan calls up. Brennan claims "his lawyer advised him to only talk over the phone", which seemed like it would be a joke, but then he backs it up with examples like claiming Martinez threatened the cohost woman in studio, and it seemed like he was trying to subtly tell LOS + Jimmy that Jimmy is kicked off the show for good now due to safety concerns.

Despite Luis J. Gomez trying to ease the tension, they don't come to any resolution on the phone. Luis even proposes an offer to sign both Brennan and Martinez together on a paid contract with GaS Digital Network, saying that Martinez wouldn't fly off the handle so easily if it was known that there was money involved. Still, the call hits a standstill. When it ends, things seem uncertain if Martinez will or won't be out of the picture in MLC's future.


----------------------------------------------------------------

#[(New) Legion of Skanks: 12/14/16 (10:30PM) -- LOS and Martinez finish reviewing the meltdown video](https://eroshare.com/i/hdu8c9nx)

[Mirror #1](https://vid.me/MoK2) // [#2](https://streamable.com/bcg4)

Context --

 Later in the show after the break, Martinez, with LOS, reviews the rest of the video clip. 

After this video, they went on several off-topic tangents about streetfighting and being kids etc. and then the show ends. Still no word on whether or not Martinez gets the boot from MLC or if/when they'll get back together to resolve the incident. 

----------------------------------------------------------------


According to these videos MLC streams again some time on next Monday, perhaps at that point we'll see the end to this. Will add an update if there's anything else worth sharing before or on Monday. I don't really follow these guys on social media etc so if anyone does follow them and sees something about this stuff feel free to send a heads up!

Not quite the classic old O Aw/J+Staff infighting sagas but hey might as well work with what we have these days

	<TEXT> Trying to figure out if there's a way to listen to the Comedy 101 that is going to take place tonight. ~~Supposedly Anthony, East Side Dave, Gavin, and Pat McInnes are all involved or at least all going to be there for it.~~

~~I'm not even 100% sure that they're talking about being at that event but it seems like all the pieces would fit, Comedy 101 is definitely tonight and Anthony called to reschedule his appearance at LOS that was going to be tonight and I think someone in that camp or someone somewhere slipped and said that he was going on Comedy 101.~~

* edit -- [Comedy 101 is definitely tonight at 8PM](http://theinterrobang.com/come-see-comedy-101-live-december/)~~but now the question is will Anthony and all those people be there for it, or somewhere else? (Anthony ended his show today saying that him and the above people were all going to be at an event tonight). And the other question is if there's a way to hear the broadcast live. If not, maybe look for periscopes when it starts at 8PM EST~~

* edit #2 -- https://vid.me/lbPV --- so it looks like a guarantee, since this Comedy 101 is at The Stand NYC, that Anthony will be either at the event or he'll be cohosting it. This will be the first time Anthony has technically co-hosted a Sirius XM show if they actually replay this or broadcast it on Sirius! 

  * If there's no broadcast tonight (kinda doubt they're going to broadcast it live) it starts at 8PM so our best bet for anyone who wants to watch it will be to find some periscopes because they definitely had them going last time. Someone made a Comedy 101 youtube video that included video footage from Periscopes that were being streamed that night </TEXT>

He used to have a cohost named Lenny Marcus who left the show because Kevin would constantly text and call him and berate him about things, basically the story is that Lenny thought it was somewhat of an act or a front but realized after awhile that he was not just putting on an act.

After Marcus left, this guy Jimmy Martinez has been a regular on their podcast, and things have gotten a little heated in the past few weeks he's been on the show but nothing like this.

Kevin called up Jimmy Martinez's agent in the middle of a show because Martinez said he had been getting work in Hollywood, and Kevin didn't believe him. He called up to ask the agent about it but then took it further by telling the agent that Martinez goes out gambling all night on the weekends and then shows up to auditions etc in the morning after being up  all weekend. This pissed off Martinez and then this happened.

We were watching the disaster known as TACSgiving 2 on the live room Wednesday when we notice how often Mike Red Bar was typing away on his computer through the whole thing. 

After Mike Red Bar got off the stream someone said why don't we go into his chatroom so we did and discovered [Mike Red Bar's Barmy wants war with Gavin's club the Proud Boys!](http://imgur.com/a/eUeJp)

Mike Red Bar claims he will destroy the life of anyone who released this video publicly so how could I resist

~~Mike Red Bar also reveals after joining the network he was 'disappointed' to find out Gavin only has about a max of 2,000 viewers on his shows~~

Also if you check on the main page I made a folder with /u/Beverly_Sheckler / Garcia Tortilla's archives in there. There's a shit ton of great stuff in there too like rips from YouTube of those numbered full shows with Louis CK / Vos / Burr / DiPaolo / CQ / Ian Halperin / Patrice appearances, the Nopies, his original Jim characters compilation, Scorch, some full years and other stuff too. With the 2 archives combined it'd be hard to run out of stuff! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if its just a problem with Archive or with the app itself but I just tried a few times and it was crashing a lot...that's a pain, it used to work perfectly.. they will still play sequentially one after another on Safari, I just liked the app more because you could save favorite archives and play in the background... if you still want to use them just bookmark

https://archive.org/details/@o_amp_a_video_archive

in Safari then you can choose any archive you want and play any clip/show it will just load the next one and start playing the next once that clip/show is over

edit - archives are playing with no problems for me but the app search function crashes it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> #####The Curse of Oak Island (Season 4)

* History Channel show

* In its 4th season

* Hoping to get the past 3 seasons if this is at all possible / available, but any episodes at all would be very much appreciated!


Off the coast of Nova Scotia sits a small island that is a riddle wrapped in enigma.

In the 1700s, people noticed strange lights there at night, and the person sent to investigate them disappeared. Eventually, a couple of kids who rowed out to the island found a strange indentation in the ground. This discovery began a quest that goes on until this day, and has involved everyone from FDR to John Wayne.

What lies beneath Oak Island? Is it a pirate treasure or a Viking horde? An ancient Fort Knox or even a lost Biblical relic like the Ark of the Covenant? No one knows, and anyone who has tried to find out has encountered an unexpected problem -- booby-traps. Someone went to great measures to hide whatever is there, because as soon as you dig down a few feet, sea-water from various hidden, man-made channels floods the hole.

Enter the Lagina brothers from Michigan. Older brother Rick is obsessed with decoding the secrets, so his little brother and Texas oilman, Marty, spent a fortune to buy access to the island. The brothers dig deep into their pockets and deploy technology like never before. This could be it, but there will be obstacles. The island is allegedly cursed. There's an old prophecy that says "7 will die before the treasure is found." The Laginas are fully aware of the death toll so far...6.

However the collection is still going through a finishing task "(this item is currently being modified/updated with a "derive" task)" once that is done the .torrent file will work properly, currently it's only 403mb so all the files aren't in there yet... that way you don't have to wait for Archive.org's seedbox to rotate around to you. Direct Download works alright.

##In this 3 hour saga, you will see and hear the downfall of a 7 -year-long member of the Opie   Anthony family. There is action, drama, suspense, professional relationships ending, black friends getting mad, white friends not knowing what to say, longtime personal friendships between comedians being irreversibly damaged, comedy specials getting bombarded with 1-star reviews, a shirtless Bobo, and much, much more. There will be plenty you've already seen or heard, and perhaps plenty that you haven't!

###VOLUME WARNING

The O J on Sirius XM clip is a lower volume than the others, and the TACS clips from November - March are the loudest. If possible, it's recommended to use the silence breaks to turn down the volume then back up as needed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to say that he was actually great back then because we all know better.... but could you imagine how 2005-8 pre-marriage, pre-children, pre-tits, pre-merger, still vaguely faux friends with Ant, comparitively easygoing (relative to now), Jocktobering, Cakestomping, poker chip destroying, Bernie Getz provoking, Shawna Lenee tear inducing, Paris Hilton interview bombing, Ed Asner insulting, CringeHumor, pre-Patrice stroke, pre-Hollywood Louie abandoned, loved enough by fans to not get booed on the Virus Tour, part of O A Show, KROCK/XM Opie would laugh, rip on, break down, and help set Jim and Anthony up to utterly destroy 2016 Opie? 2016 Opie, if he was a man that past Opie came across back in those days, would honestly be a week or more worth of recurring 30-60 minute segments of just pure trashing and brutal deconstruction beyond any redemption. What we are left with here, this human queef, actually makes the Opie of the past not seem so bad. Had we only known how far it would go. </TEXT>

Yeah it wasn't amazingly hilarious radio or a can't miss segment, I think I am just batting with a donut on CK because of his recent take-me-serious persona, was refreshing to hear the "You're fat I'm fat and your mother shits in your mouth" side of him again </TEXT>

 BTW I did a select all --- download with these MP3s and if that works out smooth, I'll put these all up on 1 archive so people can stream or DL them at max speed and not have to install soulseek and set it up and all that if they don't want to... they're all downloading well right now so by tonight or tomorrow I'll have that up if anyones interested </TEXT>

	<TITLE> O A MP3 goldmine found on Soulseek -- If you want easy MP3 downloads of O A stuff for your phone/iPod, look no further! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Out of boredom today I installed Soulseek, the old P2P music download program like KazaA/Napster/Morpheus etc... decided to try searching for O A and found some great stuff! 


There were some very obscure edits of the show that I can only find within full show uploads on YouTube for a few of them, for example an isolated clip of Nick DiPaolo and Louis CK arguing on the show, but the only thing that came up on YouTube was a 2h 44m show upload featuring the two of them I didn't look really hard but didn't see it right away either

 One of the first things that came up was something I hadn't ever heard before, a few searches on YouTube doesn't turn it up either (a small portion of it is featured in the clip below, will upload the entire thing in a little bit) it's Louis CK hosting the O A After Show with Than, not his new persona either, old timey good Louis ripping on Than a bit, ranting about things, shitting on people who call in and audience members who are still hanging around the studio after O A for this show... calling his daughter a cunt within 1-2 minutes of the broadcast starting and ensuring that it's going to be the good non-political version of LCK 

If you're bored and want to find some good O A stuff to download and put on your phone/iPad, save some data or just listen to try this old obsolete program, surprisingly there seems to be a lot of people on it and a good amount of O A clips that are downloading at a sufficient speed.


Here is a quick scroll-down of what came up when I typed Opie Anthony in the search bar, featuring a bit of that Louis aftershow somewhere in the beginning of it:

	<TEXT> This and the Chappelle's Show Walking Dead mash-up sketch were pretty much the only awesome and funny things about the entire episode, although the first sketch after the monologue with Chris Rock wasn't completely terrible, but not too great either imo... not even Dave Chappelle can save SNL from being good, the only times he made it good was when every other cast member was off of the screen </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We were talking abotu this on that live room tonight and someone I think Tom_Stall said that this just shows Sirius XM how much more irrelevant he is, he's killing off his own negotiating ability with these temper tantrums. They can see that he's not a big get outside of his current job and doesn't have professional relationships outside of work so he doesn't provide assets for them to give incentive to rehiring him. Handle this like a professional and a fuckin man and send Dana an email, make a good case for yourself, and get yourself into another one later in the year. This dude is just kicking and screaming like a child on Twitter and hurting no one but himself. Does he think the pests are going to mobilize against UFC cause Opester got shafted?

	<TEXT> Actually my man that's off about that stand your ground state part. States not like that you have it right, but the SYG law is absolutely insane with the way it's argued successfully in courts. I recommend to read about some of the craziest cases in Florida, which is pretty much the state you described, where guys have gotten no convictions or charges thrown right out with some of the ridiculous stuff they've done. I promise you'll be shocked at some of these cases.

 For example there was one guy who chased down 2 burglars off of his property, ran after them as they were fleeing for 2 blocks, stabbed them to death, hid the knife he used, didn't call police, then sold the car radios they had on them that they had stolen from OTHER people and *still* got off clean on Stand Your Ground law. He randomly died by a stray bullet a few months later too unfortunately. I'm on my phone at the moment but I'd link you otherwise, maybe I can later, but these cases aren't hard to find. Florida is a crazy state with the stand your ground law.

edit: 

Here it is

 * http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/judge-cites-stand-your-ground-to-clear-greyston-garcia-in-little-havana-stabbing-6539385

 In the midst of the Trayvon Martin controversy, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Beth Bloom has cited Florida's controversial Stand Your Ground law to drop charges against Greyston Garcia after he fatally stabbed a car radio thief in Little Havana on January 25th. Though, Garcia apparently initiated the violence, never called police, hid the knife, and then later sold two of the car radios the man had stolen.

 In the early hours of January 25, Garcia spotted Pedro Roteta and another man rummaging through his truck and taking off with his car radio according to the Miami Herald. Roteta and his accomplice had apparently been on a radio stealing spree, and Roteta was carrying a bag filled with three car radios.

 Garcia decided to chase after Roteta with a knife, and caught up to him. Roteta swung the bag of radios at Garcia's head. Garcia blocked the bag, and then countered by lunging a knife in Roteta's chest. The stabbing killed Roteta. Garcia then took off with the radio, even those not belonging to him, and never called police. Garcia hid the knife used and sold the two car radios that did not belong to him.

	<TEXT> no proof.. however he does own a nice house in a nice area of Rochester suburbs and he also owns a house on Sodus Bay right on Lake Ontario so he's gotta be paying that somehow and it'd defintely cost more than an $80k salary can handle. When I heard about all this stuff in 2008 on that split that's what they said he was offered at Clear Channel after having the fallout with Entercom.

I actually kind of like Wease cause I used to enjoy his show before getting more into O A and Howard, so I don't even mean to shit on him that much TBH, moreso calling out the overblown horse shit Opie spouts about it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah he plays things like Opie I think he has an agent and everything like he's some big name dude... that was the reason that in 2008 he fucked up his whole show and one half of them split to do a show on CMF while he went to Clear Channel to rebuild his own show without TOmmy Mule. Entercom built him this entirely new renovated nice studio  and it ended up just Mule and friends working in it because he couldn't agree to what they wanted to pay him. I guess they fall for it and he gets big contracts like $300k per year but 'word on the street' is that he barely has any savings cause of his gambling, which is why he's still doing radio as an old man when he should've retired by now. The person I know who does sales at clearchannel hates it because whenever companies ask about his ratings they find out theres multiple other shows/stations doing better than him and they'd get more of their moneys worth buying adtime on those shows, so it hurts peoples ability to sell for him.

Another fun trivia, you ever notice how Opie has all these random bands and acts like he's a big music guy but when it comes time to actually *discuss* music and not just play songs he doesn't know shit about it? I'm pretty sure that's because he just gets random suggestions from Wease. Wease was a concert promoter and actually is a music buff and I can tell from my days living there listening to Wease before I knew of where to torrent better radio (around 2006ish) that all of that shit Opie plays is spot on exactly the type of stuff Wease is into and uses as intro music coming out of commericla breaks etc. Just another little bit of the puzzle for Opie being a complete sham </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't let Opie fool you, I used to live in Rochester NY and I know people who work sales in radio there at Entercom and at Clear Channel I've asked them about the ratings. Brother Wease comes in fifth place with a very small share and third place in his own demographic, the one that he's supposed to come consistently in first in. Remember when O A trashed The Breakfast Buzz with Kimberly and Beck or Terry Clifford Morning Coffee Club? Coincidentally both of those radio shows destroy Wease in ratings and scoop up all the best companies advertising money in Rochester. He has not been popular in radio in Rochester NY since the mid 90s-early 2000s </TEXT>

Wow even less introspection that republicans had when Obama won, eh fellow liberals?

It must be everyone is evil and racist and hates women, not that u are shrill awful and dismissive. Oh and u try to crush dissent.

As much as I despised Trump, your fucking bubble needed popping.

It's almost like u jamming your horseshit "intersectionality" studies down these people's throats made them want to vote against u, huh?

"Buh buh buh my group labeled Trump a racist misogynist! How could he still win?" Gee it's almost like u cried wolf one too many times huh?

Same people who scoffed when i said Trump was gonna win scoff when I say Bernie would have won. Does your bubble EVER pop?

I get how maybe Hilary seemed great compared to Trump, but how do u ignore that she is grade-A prime patriarchy? Being young? Is that it?''

Ironically it was liberals who couldn't get over Hilary having a vagina. A Clinton dynasty is not a win for all women. It's more patriarchy

How bout next time u try talking with people instead of trying to destroy them for not swallowing every last drop of your piss like ideas?

Like maybe working class whites weren't gonna respond to having a privileged college kid yell "privilege" at them. Did that occur to u?

God no wonder I can never join a movement. How nauseating it is for me to be liberal and have to look at what liberals are now.

Democrats absolutely deserved to lose. U thought it went without saying that your side should win bc u are "the good ones." Arrogant.

All the people lefties gleefully spit on and dismissed kinda had a bug up their ass about it it turned out. U became a religion.

Exhibit A: Dems took a fucking compromised corrupt establishment lizard person and tried to sell her as the "feminist candidate."

"What do I tell my daughter?" Tell her she has to be actually qualified and not just slightly less awful than a guy like Trump maybe?

If liberals can't see how they created this shit by making people afraid to speak their mind out of fear, then Trump will get 2 terms.

Everyone is sick of having to tiptoe around some shitbag blogger shame mob. Trump stuck his thumb in your eyes and won. Get it?

In all your pathetic wailing is there gonna be ANY acknowledgement that u fucked up with your shitty fascist tactics?

Every idiot who destroyed some other idiot's Trump sign helped LEGITIMIZE Trump.

Start fucking treating people who don't agree with u like human beings instead of arguing from authority like u do now, progressives.

Instead of "I don't have time to educate u." Fucking educate people. U didn't live up to your own supposed ideals and now youre mad? Fuck u

Did u think your silly idea that "only white people can be racist" was true just bc u chanted it like an incantation?

U really thought u were just gonna win bc youre "the good ones?" Shit u should find Jesus it youre gonna be dogmatic and have faith and shit

Yes I know u thought just bc u label someone "racist" or "misogynist" that makes it fact in your world. But your world is kinda small.

In the real world u haven't been living in bc u are dicking around online, speech crimes aren't a thing. Actions are what matter.

I can't believe I was so against Trump when clearly the greater good was for liberals to pull their heads out of their asses for 5 min.

Good lucking trying to get people fired now, sjw's. U just got voted out of power. I'm really enjoying your meltdown.

No Hilary didn't lose bc people hate women. Hilary lost because she's a dishonest unlikeable woman being sold as feminist jesus. Take it

Really Hilary was a perfect candidate for u. Disingenuous and entitled and packaged and sold as some sort of "marginalized voice."

Where the fuck does an sjw find the balls to call Trump "petty" or "vindictive." That's u guys. U are those things.

Fucking whining on a blog about made up shit like "cultural appropriation" and u call Trump "petty and vindictive?" Trump is u, sweetheart.

And btw these so called feminists will tear apart any woman who doesn't fully accept the party line. U aren't feminists, you're mean girls.

Then I gotta sit there and watch these fucking liars libel me right and left and I'm a fucking liberal even.

Yeah the more I think about it, liberals needed their shitty bubble popped. U had a chance w Bernie but u were weak and stupid. U are Trump

Is your delusion so deep u really thought not being as bad as the supposed badguy is the same as being noble and good?

I didn't want Trump to win either but u people are acting like Jesus Christ got re-crucified.

Fuck your bullshit phony deluded emotions. Suck it up. Trump is as bad as u feared, yet your side lost to him. That means YOU suck.

Next time your side is in power try not sickening people with your unyielding hypocrisy for five seconds.

Bernie could have won Bernie could have won. U were wrong about Trump why are u arguing even? U fucked up.

And that's where your little religion of liberal emotion and nate silver algorithms does u the biggest disservice.

On the bright side, u gotta admit it's kind of a relief that it's finally over. America I mean.
