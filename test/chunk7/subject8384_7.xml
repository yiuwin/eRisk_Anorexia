	<TEXT> I just found this subreddit and wanted to say how much I miss the game City of Heroes by NCSoft. I cant believe they shut down the servers even though they still had a lot of players. The game would thrive so much if they would have included it in the steam store.

I miss having the feelings of superpowers. I met so many great friends there </TEXT>

They also try to sell his "crew" merchandise which probably costs like 4 dollars to make and are selling for over 50 bucks:

Perfectly placed "teasers", posting 10 times the same Spotify-Link to his track with the same picture to reach more audience (instagram)...

	<TEXT> Can you please tell me how you apply minox? Im so confused I cant really get it on my front hair.. Do you also apply it to the "borders" / side of your front hair? Cause there is so much grow. Do you only apply it to your hair or also the bald spots? Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh my hair got so much worse over the last six months... like really badly worse. im 26 and my back is almost white i still have some thin hairs there but one year ago it was almost still full. I took some pills one year ago but stopped after 2 days because i freaked about reading all those horror stories and side effects ignoring how millions of propecia takers dont have any sides and are happy... now I started again every day 1.25mg and minox once a day. i really hope it will fill up the back.

	<TEXT> what do you mean with "reset"? just cut the dosage down or try the same dosage every other day. or mo wed fr and the others day no pill. 

cutting the dosage down has almost the same effect with less sides:

	<DATE> 2017-01-28 01:37:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, im a little bit confused. i started minox / rogaine and bought liquid and foam. HOWEVER: I want to use it only once a day (night)... can  I apply more than recommended? How much do you use a day? More than allowed? And how am I supposed to get it all over my scalp ? Its impossible to reach my complete head with only 1 ml... are there any videos that could help me or sth?

my hair: http://imgur.com/a/js3wM

so how am i supposed to get it NOT on the hair but on all of my head? seems impossible...also is it even worth it to use minox on the back of my head...The bald spot is killing my self esteem (im on fin since a few weeks)

	<TEXT> Hello,

great to see you reaching out to users. I am happily using Trading212, I just wish you would add ore new features. You have been adding great new stuff over the past year.

My negatives:

- Yes, some spreads are tight and good, I also like how you change spreads (DAX- from 2 to 1.5) but some others are still too high.
- You added fees when putting money in (around 10,5%), when I started using it you didnt have any 
- Margin: Why did you make it higher? Positions will no be closed at 25%, instead of 10% one year ago. Why did you change that? It would be great if you would communicate such things.
- Why do I have to pay 2 Euros when buying stocks like Apple etc.? Didnt quite understood the reasoning.
- SWAP Fees are too high in my opinion
- No bonus programm for putting money into trading212 </TEXT>
