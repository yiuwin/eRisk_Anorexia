It was just like, "You know that episode of Quantum Leap where Sam goes back and tries to save Kennedy? What if EVERY episode was like that?" -- the creators of Timeless never understood that it was personal moments and self-redemption that made QL a success... not "famous people from history".  </TEXT>

As for sponsors? You want to wait until they start to approach you. Or, build up some ad-friendly (PG-rated) material in the genre you're interested in selling ad-space to, and then make some pitches on Famebit. Even if you're only pulling in like 1,000 views a video, you can land $100 - $300 contracts for product reviews, shout-outs, product-placement, etc.

YouTuber with 1mil+ subs here: **they're all shit. Stay independent.** If you need help with copyright / Content ID issues, talk to me - a MCN won't be able to assist you there. If you need royalty free music or assets, I can share some links. If you need help acquiring sponsors, I've worked with over 30, and could share some tips. There's literally nothing they can offer that you can't get for yourself. Unless you're able to negotiate a really favorable percentage with an off-setting signing bonus, don't bother with any network.

	<TEXT> *Star Trek* meets *Timeless*. 

I've had this idea myself - and I think there are ways to make it interesting, and maintain tension. I think longer arcs in certain time-periods would help, as well as stretches of episodes where they *don't* time travel. That being said, I agree with others here - it'd be difficult to truly sustain interest, or fill the show with any sense of 'wonder'. 

I loved Quantum Leap though, and I think keeping the temporal jumps to smaller-scale, person/ship-specific incidents (instead of saving entire planets, for example) would be really fascinating. And obviously, any time-jumps that took place within the short timeline of the show itself (going back to their own pilot) could be really neat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IANAL - but I would *not* consider that fair use. The amount used isn't relevant either, legally - but practically, a sample under 10 seconds isn't likely to be claimed. FYI.

Movie reviews though, or parody trailer, stuff like that is usually very safely in the 'fair use' category. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm - interesting plugin you have there, didn't know it was possible to see who owns the claim. 

It's entirely possible that they had a claim, fought it, and won. Or, since they're a managed channel, it is possible they weren't hit with it at all. Evidence here is spotty, but as far as I know - managed channels are only immune to automatic scans on upload. They can still be tagged by claims afterwards by both an automated search, or manual tagging. I know, because I was managed with Maker Studios, and now own my own independent MCN. 

I don't know that it qualifies as a double standard though. The channels that are managed have proven themselves in many ways, and YouTube, and/or their respective networks know that they are able to be trusted. 

In the meantime, if you have a LEGITIMATE fair use to a piece of copyrighted material, never be afraid to dispute *and* appeal, *and* counter-notify. Most people get scared, and give up after the first step, and then bitch that the system doesn't work. You can't give up after the first period in a hockey game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  with seemingly no recourse

How do you know they aren't hit with claims constantly? Their work is fair use, so they probably just dispute the claims as they get them. 

I'd recommend watching my video on [Content ID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slgldWAsB0M) - it'll explain everything you seem confused about.

Don't be afraid to do film reviews though; I've uploaded more 3rd-party copyrighted material to my channels than *probably* anyone else on all of YouTube, and I'm happy to report that I still have a 100% win-rate with the 2,000+ claims I've received over the years.
