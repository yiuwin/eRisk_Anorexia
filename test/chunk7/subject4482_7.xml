	<TEXT> Similar story here. At some point of time in my life, a friend attempted to gift me a canine. I looked straight at him and gave him a negative response. My justification is that I already owner a single canine and another single feline, and having an additional one would be costly. To be honest, I am not too fond of barking mammals.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What I described is DotA at 0-2K MMR, in the best case scenario.

You've said it yourself. You just described the experience of statistical outliers, at the end that nobody cares about no less. 

 A PvE game is not very fun if you suck and constantly get your ass whooped by the monsters. For some, it is even worse because it's not other people beating you, it's "the computer".

I mean, this is why game designers exist. They find the sweet spot between "too difficult" and "no challenge". If, in a PvE game, the player constantly gets his "ass whooped by the monsters", that's not the player's fault for sucking, it's really just bad design.

Can you win Football Manager?

Football Manager is not a story/campaigned based game. It's a simulator. That's yet another type of gaming experience.

Millions of people play football, with the majority comprising of kids fighting to kick the ball towards the opposing team's goal and finding that fun or middle class workers playing together after work or during company cohesions as a casual get-together session. In reality, only a very small minority of people actually care about playing football with playing to win in mind and that minority is amateurs, professionals and a little bit of passionate fans. In the end, the "millions of people" have fun but it's not because of the mechanics and rules of the game at all. Correlation is not causation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the game is still intended to be intrinsically fun. You kill stuff, you get more powerful, you kill people, you win, you enjoy yourself. Simple.

Perhaps don't say "simple" if you're gonna get it wrong. What you've described is the experience you'd get from playing a PvE, story/campaign based game. That is because such games were made to be won; they are ultimately another piece of entertainment, like movies except less linear and a lot more interactive. Dota, however, is neither PvE nor story/campaign based and obviously not intended to be won by every human player. 

Dota is not intrinsically fun. The fun comes from the competitive, PvP aspect of the game i.e. if a person isn't fond competitiveness or winning other people in general, they are unlikely to enjoy Dota. Same applies for other esports and traditional sports. When people find a game fun, it is also often just the satisfaction of winning/completing something. Dota is not made to be won eventually at some point. There isn't a day where a player can (correctly) say "yay I've beaten the game" for Dota. Your chances of winning and losing are realistically based on how good you (and your team) are against the enemy team. If you win a match of dota, you would be satisfied with beating *other players*, not the game. And even then, winning a match doesn't necessary make you happy/satisfied, it also depends on how you took it emotionally throughout the duration of the match. You can win and still be tilted or lose and still enjoy the intensiveness of the match. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And the problem is? Dota has always been designed around being competitive; being a sport. It was never intended to be intrinsically fun. Not that it can't or shouldn't be but it is just not designed with that as the top priority. As such, it only makes sense to improve the competitive experience as much as possible even if it means sacrificing the uncompetitive, casual experience. At most, Valve only needs to make sure thay the game is just fun enough for people to not quit the game to keep the cash coming in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a wild guess but I doubt any dinosaur larger than a toddler would do that. Constantly having such quick, sharp and repetitive movement doesn't sound sustainable at a weight where inertia would have a noticeable impact, especially when it's at the neck. And I'm sure this visual trick wouldn't work if the movement is any less quick and sharp. But who knows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dota doesnt work by logic, it works by stats.

Yes, and Monkey King contradicts that. He is given the superior attack range based on lore and that is working by logic. Every other melee hero having the same attack range regardless of weapon is what's not working by logic and I agree, it should not work by logic, so Monkey King is a problem. Fair point about Io.

are previous abilities "holy" and shouldnt be murred?

Fissure is a huge reason people pick ES. While path block is good, long ranged stun and nuke is what makes a hero a good support. To give those factors to a carry and, worse still, change the damage to be based on his physical attack damage and even add in critical strike, that's beding things too much to this monkey's favor. Honestly tell me, which hero wouldn't benefit a lot from having boundless strike instead of any one of their current skills? And it's not like the Monkey King's other abilities are inferior.

 Again, dont hold dota for some fake logic. monkey has a few unique abilities in an otherwise simple hero - stun, utility/mobility, on hit passive, and an ult. you cant have all the heroes be wraith king, you need some spice.

Implementing a new mechanic into the game isn't some "fake logic", whatever it may mean. And having a whole mechanic coded out just for one single ability isn't good design - what would you think of it as the programmer? Tree dance isn't just yet another mobility skill like how simply you put it. Leap, skewer, timber chain, meat hook, force staff, etc. can all be simply described as moving a target towards a point/direction at X speed and that obviously cannot be said for tree dance. There's a lot of "if"s you need to consider, code wise, when you're integrating a hero with a tree i.e. a destructible that has a few functions on its own. 

And since we're on the topic of mechanics, Mischief is another offender of this and it's on the very same hero. It sure is a very interesting mechanic that I would like seen more in the future but is completely unneeded on Monkey King, especially when he already has more than 4 skills. What does mischief synergize with? In the end, it's just an ability that's here to add to the "lore-friendliness" that's getting way too friendly on this hero and only him. Also, the concept of the mechanics behind mischief isn't a solid one. How to tell? If a mechanic is solid, it can be done in dynamic functions. However, the function that determines Monkey King transforms into based on his location is entirely hard-coded. So what happens if there's a significant change towards runes and/or consumable items? It has to be entirely recoded. It's very interesting for sure and that's because it's forced to be. The dynamism is faked.

 Also silencer. Its just a fun little point that goes into him. I dont see the problem.

Yes, it's an innate ability, but it's less of an ability than a simple passive function and even less unique compared to mischief. Stat stealing/gaining is available in enough heroes to not be considered as a one-of-a-kind mechanic which mischief clearly is. 

Might I introduce you to invoker?

Except you don't have all 10 spells at your disposal right off the ability bar. Invoker may have 10 spells, but he has to activate the correct combination of reagents to invoke the ability to cast each spell, and the additional difficulty of having to do that justifies giving him more than 4 unique spells. I mean, why am I even explaining, there is no doubt you know this; there is also no doubt you're refuting for the sake of refuting since there's an obvious justification you already saw coming. Just why?

  I chalk pretty much all you say to you not liking new things, ... weird anger at valve incorporating stuff that you are not comfortable with.

You're half right here. I don't like new things that are made for the sake of just one "thing", which is a hero in this case. I'm not comfortable with the fact that the metagame is now going to be affected by marketing and sales figures. You can call bullshit on my game design knowledge for what it's worth but I'm not here to necessarily say things people like or reinforce what people already know - that's just wanting attention and karma. Look at New Bloom, then spring cleaning, then how Valve approves poorly made cosmetics (think TA's onyx lotus), along with all the very oriental-looking sets that are borderline lore-breaking, then now Monkey King. Like I said I am okay if their sales and marketing are influencing the cosmetics department, but if it's starting to influence the metagame as well (which can be extrapolated from their actions) it cracks the integrity of the game as a competitive game/esport.  

Also, sure, fuck me for being Chinese and talking about other Chinese from the view of a Chinese. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd consider path block to have more significance over long range stun and damage? How often do you see fissure used as path block outside of early game ganks and creep blocking at the base entrances? Do you actually think that the spell is utilized more in game like that rather than as a relatively long ranged ground target stun and nuke? It's even used at point blank to combo with aftershock and whatnot. 

Theory is pointless if it doesn't work that way in practice. At least have a good point if you want to patronize someone, not that you should in the first place.

	<TEXT> He is given undeniable bias based on his lore. As in the Chinese legend of Sun Wukong in Journey to the West. Here's some examples off my head:

* 300 attack range melee hero, the one and only. The justification is that he uses the jingu bang. However, the jingu bang is actually a short rod by default and there's already boundless strike to pay homage to its changeable size. At this rate, why don't we start changing all the attack ranges based on the hero's weapon too? Surely phantom lancer, who uses a lance, shouldn't share the same attack ranges as dark seer,  who punches? After all, phantom lancer actually has an mkb (which is jingu bang) cosmetic. 

* Earthshaker's fissure used to be one of the most iconic aoe stun spell of dota. Now it's just the retarded brother of boundless strike. The existence of the latter is equivalent to pissing all over earthshaker.

* Tree Dance is an whole new mechanic by itself (movement based on trees) just for this monkey. Balance wise, unless you have specific heroes with vision granting abilities, there are literally zero possibilities of detecting him outside of the fixed high ground ward spots. Gives him insane mobility when not fighting heroes too. There's also this: so you're telling me that he has the ability to instantly jump 1000 distance away onto a tree, but somehow it has to be a tree and he can't just jump forward onto ground?

* A passive that grants 60% lifesteal once you hit an enemy hero 4 times. Well that's gonna be reeeal hard with 300 range.

* An innate ability active ability. There's only a grand total of 2 other heroes that has this, namely techies and earth spirit (might be wrong but would make little difference). And both abilities have no usefulness on their own while mischief is an invaluable, effortless, costless but significant mindfuck to the enemy. All in the name of being lore-friendly. Also yet another whole new mechanic just for this monkey. The amount of hard-coding that goes into making this ability the way it is is rather distasteful if I say so myself. 

Oh did I also mention that he has a total of 6 unique abilities?

To put it bluntly, Valve is just sucking the balls of the Chinese community, and I'm saying this as a Chinese. It is especially evident from last year till now and it's not hard to see when you're actively looking for it. I can still close an eye when it's only at a cosmetic level but, now that it's going to influence the metagame, it's an ugly sight. Coming from someone who does game design, this is a low for Valve and it surely makes me question their integrity as game developers. Ultimately, they are a business and they're not doing anything outright unethical or illegal so that's the reality of things.      </TEXT>

The idea is to make him coherent to the game, especially relative to the rest of the heroes in the game. IMO, and from a design perspective, this monkey is given too much lore bias so this is how I would fix him up.
