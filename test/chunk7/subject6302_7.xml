	<TEXT> [SPOILERS]

I adored this show when it first came out. Then, when Gretchen's depression surfaced (as someone who also suffers from mental illness) I thought the show was being really brave and thought provoking. 

Still, as time went on, I went from constantly laughing at this show and loving the characters, to feeling like I'm slowly watching people I care about destroy their lives. Even in the beginning of Gretchen's illness I loved Lindsay and Edgar's zany side-antics, but now even their storylines have gotten really dark. (I also completely hate Edgar's girlfriend and the fact that Lindsay got back with her husband and is basically in the same place she started in at the beginning of the show, except pregnant.) 

I'm slowly starting to dislike all the characters. Maybe the show is THAT meta though, and I'm supposed to slowly start hating everyone? Thoughts?  

EDIT: I'm not really saying the show got *worse* I think the writing and character development is still very complex, but I am enjoying it far less than I used to. Maybe it's just too *real* for me? I'm not sure... still trying to process how I feel.

	<TEXT> So the Taco Cabana near my house does mariachi music super loud twice a week and people go there and dance and it's always packed on those nights. It's a lot of fun and I like their food and stuff. We live a stone's throw away from Mexico so the population here is like 97% Mexican American. It's also the largest military instillation in the USA. 

Still, two years in a row, Taco Cabana's mariachi days have fallen on 9/11 and I bitched about it both times because it just felt super shitty to me. Several of my friends have told me that it's not really a big part of Mexican culture to "observe" (or whatever) 9/11. That pisses me off too, because they are Americans who want to be treated as such (as they should be!) and yet they claim "not my culture" when I express frustration at a large corporation throwing a rip-roaring party on 9/11. 

It just bugs me and nobody seems to understand why. They are just like "calm down, who ducking cares?" I'm not saying everyone needs to walk around with their heads down acting sad but just hearing the music and seeing the partying feels garish and disrespectful to me. I'm not even THAT patriotic. I'm not offended when people choose not to stand for the pledge or national anthem. Whatever, you do you. I wouldn't even be as upset if someone threw a party at their house on 9/11. It just feels shitty to me when a huge company doesn't give enough of a fuck to post-pone their bi-weekly party for this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't say cats don't mourn. They certainly do. They don't mourn for as long as we do and not the way we do. If a mom cat loses her baby or the baby is adopted out, they get over it after a while, whereas if someone stole my daughter I'd never get over it. The op of this thread is insinuating that months, if not years later, the mother still goes to the grave to mourn. Heck no techno. 

Maybe if a cat grew up with an owner or another pet for the majority of its life it might mourn longer or not be the same but I'm not buying OPs story in this case. Not a bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, all of these articles use anecdotes as possible evidence that cats *might* cry due to emotions but state doubt and a severe lack of scientific evidence.  They then go on to cite illness as a real cause for tears. You are basically posting people saying the equivalent of "lol I dunno , maybe?" 

Give me a real source.  Even these articles you are trying to convince me with say they lack proof or even good evidence and that cats most likely don't cry. 

Shit, the cat was most likely a stray considering its wandering around outside with kittens, there is a great chance it was sick. 

Claiming the cat still mourns at the grave casts even more bullshit in your story. When mom cats have their kittens taken away they look for them for a few days at most and then get over it. If cats were as emotional as humans, then separating them from their young would be animal abuse.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He started accusing me of cheating on him or being sneaky. He had a reason, one by one, to hate all my friends, convinced me they were trying to break us up and isolated me from them. Then he did the same with my family. It was a self fulfilling prophesy because after he did that they really did try and get me to leave him, but by then I was brainwashed. 

I was slowly given less and less freedom over a long period of time until I wasn't allowed to go grocery shopping, go to a laundromat or leave the house. Even my internet access was limited through constant monitoring. Little changes over time that prevented big red flags from going off. Like a frog in the pot that doesn't notice the water getting hot until it's boiling. 

He never physically hit me but by the end he was knocking food out of my hands, throwing things past me and hitting walls next to my head and I knew it was a precursor to physical abuse. What got me out was our daughter. 

She had no clean clothes and so I demanded to be allowed to go to the laundromat. He consented because he was too lazy to do it himself. Once I got there he demanded I come home and when I refused he said he left our one year old at home alone. I rushed home and he had been bluffing, but for me the writing was on the wall. He could torture me all he wanted but I would not allow him to effect my daughter's life. 

The next day I left without permission to go wash clothes *with* my baby. He texted, threatening to kill himself if I didn't go home. I told him to do it and then called the cops and had them do a welfare check on him. They arrested him because he had warrants for unpaid traffic tickets. I went home and changed the locks and never let him in again. After almost a week of sleeping outside in the desert behind the house, he got the message and left. It was about a year before he stopped trying to "win me back" though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A little under a month.

So I used to have a tricky shoulder that would come out of socket when he and I first started dating. About three weeks after we started dating, we were laying in bed after sex and he whispered in my ear. "I think I love you." 

I was not expecting that and whipped around so quick that I lost my balance and fell out of bed and dislocated my shoulder. So I was screaming in pain and he was freaking out because he didn't know what to do and I finally got it back in socket.... And that ladies is how I got out of saying "I love you" without anyone getting their feelings hurt. 

No I didn't do it on purpose but it bought me a few days with which to search my feelings and resize I loved him too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know exactly the point you meant. You clarifying it just made me more sure. 

You keep saying you are not perfect so even you admit you are doing something wrong. Scolding a grieving person. You should be ashamed of yourself. 

Now you are sitting here having a pity party because I'm "picking on you" for "not being perfect". This isn't fucking about you it's about this suffering person. The world does not revolve around you and I am not going to feel sorry for you because you can't keep your mouth shut because you "feel too deeply." 

It's the Internet for god sake, it's not like something accidentally slipped out of your mouth, you typed it. If you really think that shameful comment was an accident because you are "not perfect" then fucking delete it.  </TEXT>

I knew a lot of kids growing up who didn't know their fathers at all because their mothers cut all ties. Many of them almost worshipped the *idea* of their fathers and resented the hell out of their moms. Many did not consider that perhaps the mom had a good reason. 

I have a friend who is a family lawyer and he also told me that the courts won't legally take away his right unless he is dangerous. He's an ass but he isn't dangerous. I don't think he would fight me if I did it illegally because he can't afford to take me to court but then things get nasty and that can be traumatic for her too. 

Like I said, we are moving to another city soon and he won't bother following so I think this problem is about to solve itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it possible to have her go back to work and hire someone to watch your child while you both are at work? 

I lost my job about a year ago and have since been working from home as a freelance writer. Work is hard to come by and I've slowly been spiraling into a deep depression. I did not realize how much I based my self worth on my work. 

Being home all day, every day with any child, let alone one with extra struggles, sounds very depressing. It sounds like a dream to a lot of people who work full time, to get to stay home all day with the kid(s) but in reality, for many, becomes soul crushing. 

Most people thrive on accomplishment and if you are not getting out of the house every day and accomplishing things, however menial and inconsequential they may be, it becomes easy to spiral into depression until *nothing* matters. Tell me, were things better when she was still working?

	<TEXT> He plays with our daughter's heart. She's seven. 

He sees her about 1-2 times a year. Christmas and her birthday (half of the time). He is allowed to see her whenever he wants and we live in the same city. He still only sees her once or twice a year and I suspect it's because his parents ask where she is on Christmas or her birthday, not because he cares at all. 

He sees her just often enough to make it really hurt. She adores him. After she sees him, she cries because she misses him and wants to see him more. This goes on for months until she finally hardens her heart and then it's about time for him to rip the wound open and see her again. I wish he would just decide to either be involved or abandon her altogether instead of constantly wounding her. 

I thought about just not allowing him to see her anymore but I'm not going to be the one my daughter blames for keeping her and her dad apart. She has to realize he's a dick on her own. The second she tells me she doesn't want to see him anymore I'll oblige but not before that. Luckily were moving soon so I figure after that, he won't bother to travel to see her. 

One time he asked to see her out of the blue. I asked him why once he brought her home, you know, just casually because it's really out of character for him. Maybe he was finally missing her? No. He said he took our daughter with him on a first date  with a women he knew who liked kids because he thought it would help grease the wheels and show her he was a good dad. I was furious. 

I don't hate him for the seven times I caught him cheating when we were together. I don't hate him for the psychological abuse. I don't hate him for making me work two jobs while going to school full time and having to do all the housework so he could play video games all day and do nothing else. I don't hate him for the endless nights crying myself to sleep or the way he isolated me from my family. To hate him for Those things would mean there were still fucks to give about our relationship. I have no fucks for that. do however have a lot of fucks to give about my daughter.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I'm a total potty mouth. I have a seven year old daughter and instead of not swearing around her, I just taught her what certain words are "grown up" words, so she doesn't swear at all (Yet!) but I still do. I've been told that expecting this to work in the long term is a pipe dream and I respect that viewpoint. 

I have an English degree. It's my opinion that words are mostly about how you use them. There are no "bad" words. Telling someone they are worthless can be just as hurtful as calling them a fuck-head. It's all about how you use your words. In a perfect world, if my seven year old stubbed her toe and screamed "fuck!" I would not care. If she said "fuck you mom" I'd be furious. It's about how you use a word and not if (to me). 

Still, I realize the real world does not work that way so I've banned my daughter from swearing. So far so good. When she gets older and learns to use discretion I think I can teach her about the right setting to swear in and about how to use swear words in the right context. I never swear at work or in the wrong setting, but you bet your ass I swear at home. 

I've been wondering if any of you grew up with a mom (or even a dad) who swears and turned out fine. I'm open to my mind being changed if need-be. 

EDIT: I guess the reason I'm asking is I've seen threads about people who felt scarred from their parents swearing *at* them and though I've never sworn at my kid, I've sworn *about* stuff. 

Ex: "sweetie, please clean your room there is shit all over the floor." 

"Jeez! Your teacher gave you so much fucking homework!" 

"That girl making fun of your shoes sounds like an asshole and you need to not listen to her. Your shoes are fucking gorgeous and that should not even matter. What matters is who you are as a person and she sounds like a shitty person."  </TEXT>

Also where are these fictional little girls working out at PF? I'm in the women's locker room every day and I've never seen one. 

Alright, since you are an expert in transgenderism, at what point should we allow men in transition to women to use the women's bathroom? Where are we drawing the line? It's not so black and white! Unless they are being super overt, how do we tell who is peeping and who is just minding their own business? Aaaaand if someone were being overtly creepy and trying to creep on me, I'd report them regardless of gender. Women can rape too and women can be creepy too. Maybe we should ban lesbians from the PF women's bathroom too! What if they secretly enjoy seeing me change?! And I have seen some burly lesbians in my day too so maybe strong women should not be allowed in there either  because they might scare these little girls that are running around PF apparently. And what if the lesbians lie and say they are not gay?! Best not to let anyone in the bathroom,  you know, just to be safe!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man, a bathroom argument. This keeps getting better. News flash, any business that allows trans people to use their bathroom of choice doesn't force people to *prove* they are trans. What are they supposed to have a guy posted at the door to check their trans cards? What do you expect? 

There's no lever and the fact that you think there is, is just proof you have never set foot In a PF. There's an alarm that can be set off by *employees* (or loud noises) when someone drops a weight or is screaming through a set and honestly I prefer that. Respect the equipment and those around you should be a rule at every gym. Nobody wants to hear your shitty excuse for a roar. (Not you specifically, I just me the jack-wads who yell and throw weights). 

If someone wants to yell and throw shit they can go to another gym but it's nice to go places where it's not allowed so I don't have to put up with it. Plenty of gyms don't allow dropping weights or screaming but PF gets flack because they installed a funny alarm? Please.

And the pizza keeps people from leaving? Really. Yeah I know I love paying 10$ a month for a single slice of shitty pizza once a month at an inconvenient time. Makes total sense. </TEXT>

Haha that's very flattering I adore him and it's hard for me to find other people who know any of his songs besides cats in the cradle. My favorite song is A Better Place to Be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahaha you have a great imagination. That would be a great story. In all honesty even though I think he and I would have been a great fit, when I line them up side by side I think my fianc and I are a little bit better. My friend is a neat freak for instance and I'm a bit of a slob. It's little things like that, that I think about. It's not much but it's something. 

Also, my fianc and I have been through some REALLY hard stuff together and remained rock solid and you cant put a price on that. I didn't see the point of risking the unknown and leaving a great thing. Also, when I met my fianc my daughter was two and now she is seven so she considers him her father. It's just not worth it for so many reasons.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's sad because we really are not friends anymore because of it. I think cheating is the most vile thing a person can do and id never cheat on my boyfriend, but I also don't pursue friendship with my buddy because I don't want to foster feelings I shouldn't be having. I don't like putting myself in tricky situations like that. Best to let it die.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Story time

In 8th grade I moved to a new city and went to public school for the first time after being homeschooled and made a total ass of myself on the first day because I had no social skills. I was also really really fat and that never helps you make friends in middle school. There was one boy who said I seemed like a pretty cool chick and was nice to me. He was really short and skinny and nerdy.

I found out later that day that we rode the same bus and he lived a few houses down the street from me. We became best friends. We played in the desert behind out houses and built forts. My mom used to joke and say we would get married one day and we both gagged at the idea. His dream was to grow up and be a soldier AND a lawyer and I wanted to be a published writer AND a teacher. (Crazy kids and their big dreams right?)

He went off to military school the following year and we missed each other horribly. Still, we played video games online and would write to each other. A year later my family moved again. We stayed in contact, but over the years it dwindled to maybe an email a year. We both grew up. He joined the army and served two tours, one in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. We both got married and had daughters. We both got divorced. I decided to go back to college and moved to the town we had first met in. He lived elsewhere by then though. Over a year after I had moved there, I ended up running into him at a grocery store and my heart stopped. He was 6'2" and built like a tank, but beside that, he was still my best friend from 8th grade. I had lost weight and was slim and fit myself. I was dating someone pretty seriously at the time and so was he. nothing romantic happened but my boyfriend and I had him over for dinner to catch up. He was in town visiting his parents. 

Time passed and the boyfriend and I broke up. Found out my friend was going to be in town soon after. We decided to hang out and we both were drinking. He ended up spilling his guts about getting PTSD from the war and how he just got out of a bad relationship. One thing lead to another and we were ripping into each other like animals. Over a decade of this hidden lust that neither of us had fully acknowledged to ourself. We had sex all night and it was *insanely* good. 

I was basically instantly infatuated with him but he had just gotten out of a long relationship and didn't live there so I understood when he casually mentioned the next morning that he didn't want to be in a relationship with anyone for a while. It hurt a little, (ok maybe a lot..) but I was  an expert at acting casual. I left that afternoon and decided to join a dating web page because being with him made me realize I was lonely. I met my soon-to-be husband a week after the night I spent with my friend. About six months after we had slept together I got a call from my friend basically confessing his love for me and telling me we were meant to be together. It broke my heart because that was all I ever wanted but I was in love with my boyfriend so I made the decision to stay and I've never regretted it. I'm going to marry the man I'm with now. He is wonderful. 

My friend will always be my "what if" though. The one who never quite was... 

Side note: He finishes law school this year and I finish getting my masters In Education. I also published my first book last year. I guess we both secretly always knew what we wanted. Just never got the timing right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. Absolutely. 

I'm not saying it's the *only* way to have a good relationship but it's the only way for me. 

My SO is going to know more about me, my quirks, my habits and the way I handle money than anyone else. He is the one who will know me most completely. He will be the one who I will be around the most. He better be my best friend! </TEXT>
