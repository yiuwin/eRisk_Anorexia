	<TEXT> I dunno. My behaviors have changed so many times over the years. I've been doing really well with restricting/fasting/not binging for the past little while and so it seems like my brain got annoyed with me and changed things up a bit. 

Suddenly I have new rules. I can't eat before 5 pm. I can only eat a salad with certain ingredients. (I deviated from that rule last night and it almost broke my mind lol) I have to make the salad last for at least an hour and I can't eat every bite. I have to leave some "for later" which just gets thrown out the next day. After I eat the salad, I have to wait til 8:30, and then I can have my yogurt (specific brand and flavor only) and Quest bar. This has to last an hour.

Any change from this routine causes me an insane amount of anxiety. Am I broken? LOL. 

Side question...does anyone else view their brain as a separate entity? Like, it's hard to explain.... I just feel like it's this controlling, parasitic being that has taken over my body and sometimes I can fight it and be "me" but other times, not so much. Like right now. And these rules. 

Sorry for rambling. I'm not even drunk, just uncharacteristically chatty lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keto! In two weeks time, even if not eating at a massive deficit, your body will look leaner, less bloated, and more defined even if you haven't lost but a pound or two. When you are not eating carbs, your body isn't holding on to as much water so your muscles take on a leaner more defined look. (I know there is a much more sciency explanation for what I'm trying to say but yeah, lol, not a scientist here.)

Keto has been a literal life changer for me. There are some good groups on FB as well as subs on Reddit if it interests you.

Good luck with your event. You're going to rock it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Planned for today. I doubt it will change. I've gotten to a place where this is safe for me, I don't have to get all anxious about counting anything because I know it by heart now. I tried deviating last night and it almost gave me a panic attack. So, back to the safe foods.

Breakfast- skip

Lunch- skip

Dinner- 1.5 cup shredded iceberg lettuce, 1.5 cup baby spinach, 28g shredded reduced fat cheese, 3 tbsp Deli Style Simple Relish, 1 tbsp Hormel bacon pieces, Walden Farm's ranch dressing. 126cals/3g net carbs/7g fat/14g protein.

Dessert- Chobani 0 yogurt, Quest bar. 270 cals/10g net carbs/9g fat/36g protein

Total: 396 cals/13g net carbs/16g fat/50g protein. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, not offended at all!

It took me forever to learn to eat normally again after the Zyprexa. I was scared for a while that it permanently damaged my brain's ability to recognize fullness signals again. But that may have just been the ED too, because let's face it...I have no idea how to eat "normally" anyways. Restricting just makes it all so much easier than worrying about proper portions and crap like that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I almost never drink water unless I am feeling super extra shitty and I know my electrolytes are out of wack. And then in that case, I usually add Mio to it, freeze it, and then crunch on it like it's a snack.

I have never been a water drinker. I drink energy drinks (sugar/carb free zero cal of course), black coffee, and Powerade Zero all day instead. Super healthy! LOL. But water makes me nauseated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats on your goal weight, but I totally get you. My first gw was 105, then I thought 100 would be a nice even number and then 98 but no 96 sounds better. And so on. I made an attempt for a month or so to slow it down and eat "normal" which resulted in me eating one normal meal and then spiraling into a course of binging because I had been hungry for so damn long. So, I went back to restricting and now 86 has a nice ring to it. It's not even about the weight anymore, it's about chasing a number. A *feeling* even. I will feel so much better when I get to that number. But I'm pretty sure that number doesn't exist, or the feeling that goes along with it. 

Sorry for the ramble. I suck at explaining things, but I get it. I have no advice because I feel the same way and I'm too warped to see things clearly...but just know you're not alone. Sorry you are feeling this way. 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not worried about the other stuff being a thousand percent accurate, so much as the weight. As long as that is accurate, I'm happy with a ballpark idea on the other stats. 

Shoot, anything is better than my old scale. The weight would fluctuate so badly on that thing depending on how I was standing, where I was standing, if I looked at it funny, etc lol.
I could weigh myself five minutes apart and gain or lose 6 pounds. Talk about a complex!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Finally broke down and bought a digital scale. I'm excited and terrified at the same time. I know my old scale isn't accurate (it's a dial scale and it's temperamental) but I *know* it, if that makes any sense. 

http://bodyfatgenius.com/balance-scale-review/
This is the new scale. It's supposed to be accurate within .2 lbs, and it also measures your BMI, muscle mass, bone density (uh oh) and hydration.

So, I'm excited to have a new gadget, but terrified to find out if I weigh more on an accurate scale. Fingers crossed, it will be here today and I'm either going to be really happy or want to throw myself off a bridge lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I HATE Zyprexa with a burning fury. When I was sloppily treated by an incompetent psych team years ago for AN, Zyprexa was the "cure", along with therapy that never really addressed the AN. (It's no surprise that 15 years later I'm worse than before.)

At first it made me feel "better" because that along with the shit ton of other meds I was put on, I was too zonked to obsess or even care at all. But I went from obsessed to apathetic in like, three day's time, and completely just switched from starvation to nonstop eating because Zyprexa completely killed my brain's ability to recognize fullness signals, as well as give one single fuck. I legit gained a million pounds in like, a week. 

Anyways, congrats on your weight loss! That's awesome in and of itself but to do it while on Zyprexa....you are a GOD!

	<TEXT> Is the food making you happy? Don't feed your depression! Think of something that will offer you even a moment of happiness...just something to change gears and give your brain time to reset itself out of binge mode. Do you like to read? Maybe read a chapter of your favorite book? Really immerse yourself into the story, become the character. Even if it's only temporary, escaping this world for a little bit can be just the change you need to let your mind calm down. 

I'm sorry you're in such a bad place. I know it's so easy to say "eating all that junk isn't going to make you feel any better, why not stop?" and I'm a hypocritical asshole for saying it to someone else. I just don't want you to feel worse afterwards like I always do. It feels good at the moment, but afterwards, not so much. 

Chin up. Have a hot bubble bath, a book, and some good music. Sia's music is amazing when I'm feeling extra shitty, just so you know. Hang in there. 3 </TEXT>

I try not to watch too many food specific documentaries for fear it will spark a craving of some sort that will result in three days of me trying not to think of said craving, fucking up anyways, binging and then hating myself more than ever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am really a loner, most of it is my own fault because I self-isolate and tbh I prefer that most days. But sometimes I miss the feeling of togetherness and just belonging in a circle of friends or even acquaintances. 

I'm so sorry you're feeling so bad. Do you enjoy reading? Sometimes I go to bookstores and read just so I don't feel so alone. It helps me feel like I'm not 100% isolated but doesn't mess with my anxiety too much because I am not actually interacting with people. 

The internet, and this sub in particular and all of it's wonderful people, has given me more of a feeling of a connection to others than I have felt in a long time. You are not alone here. 3  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, to update...I "only" ate half the pan before I got sick feeling. Still, excessive but at least my body had more control than my mind today. My mind quickly shifted back to hyper controlling and now I can't even chew a piece of gum because 5 calories is too much, and I want to cry because I ate sooooo much even though I was okay with it earlier. 

Oh this life is just too fucking much fun! And some people think having an ed is a choice. Ha!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I woke up this morning with a "fuck it" attitude, took a vacation day, and stayed home with the absolute intention of binging all day on crap I normally wouldn't even think about, much less eat.

I have the house to myself (roommate is gone YAS). I baked (I hate baking) a pan of lemon bars with a graham cracker crust, and as soon as they cool off, I'm going to eat the whole goddamn pan, no fucks given.

I think what was left of my mind is gone. Idgaf right now about calories/fat/carbs. I'm sure once I eat this pan of lemon bars and whatever else I can shovel in, the remorse will creep in and make me want to die, but for the moment, I'm enjoying the apathy. 

Fuck me I've lost it lmao.  </TEXT>
