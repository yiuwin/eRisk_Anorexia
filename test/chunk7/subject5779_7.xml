	<TEXT> There should be some purchasing power index to go with the laws. If a law in 1995 specified a fine of 200 moneys while sandwiches costs 2 moneys, the fine should be 300 when sandwiches costs 3. In India, you pay a 7 USD fine or face a 6 month sentence. In the US, I've heard arguments saying the H1B visas (used by tech companies to hire cheaper immigrants) should have doubled the minimum salary by now. </TEXT>
