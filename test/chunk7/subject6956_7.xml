	<TEXT> Oh I get horrible show nerves - I actually have to take a beta blocker to be able to ride competently. And I do the Hunters/Eq. My local organization has a .70 m jumper division this year that I REALLY want to do, but I don't know if my trainer will allow it! Lately I've been jumping 2"6 at home but I might just do 2"3 next weekend. My only reservation about 2"3 is that it's filled with kids who are literally like 10 years younger than me haha  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And, I mean this mentally, not physically.

I hate this eating disorder so much. I woke up this morning completely emotionally labile. All I think about is food. My day revolves around when I'll be eating, when I won't be eating, *what* I'll be eating. I planned to eat some eggs with 2 strip of bacon for breakfast (264 calories). I plan out my food a week in advance, so I knew this was coming. I had a similar breakfast yesterday? Two days ago? I don't remember. I sat down to eat it, picked at it, got up and threw it away. Maybe it was the fat that was bothering me? 

So I went to the freezer, grabbed some fruit I had portioned out, thawed it, took a shower and came back to the fruit. I pierced a piece with my fork and couldn't do it. Maybe it was the carbs/sugar? I don't know, but I threw the fruit away, too. THEN I decided to make an egg white omelet with no bacon, no butter, no oil. Just straight up protein. And yes, I threw that out as well. 

Nothing is safe to eat. There's nothing I want to eat. I know I need to fuel myself, particularly as an athlete, and additionally with final exams coming up. But I can't do it. I can't even get myself to compete in a horse show because it means I need to fuel myself. I hate this. My eating disorder is winning. I'm starting to pick my eating disorder over the love of my life (my horse). Eating disorders are about control, but I never thought I'd allow it to control my horse riding. I thought I had control over what my eating disorder controls...I guess I don't. I just want to lay in bed and cry all day. In theory, I have a really lovely life, but I'm wasting it on this eating disorder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You lose based on whatever your deficit is. The larger the deficit, the faster the weight loss/greater loss per week. 

For example, my TDEE is around 1800. If I were to eat 1000 calories a day, that's an 800 calorie deficit per day. There are 3500 calories in a pound. So if I eat at an 800 calorie deficit per day for 7 days, that's 800*7 = 5600 calorie per week deficit. 5600/3500 = 1.6 pound loss per week. 

Say I eat 500 calories a day. That's a 1300 calorie per day deficit. So 1300*7 = 9100 calorie per week deficit. 9100/3500 = 2.6 pound loss per week. 

Of course there are major fluctuations with water retention, the loss of water weight, etc, meaning weight loss is not linear. Sometimes you will lose more or less weight than mathematically laid out. For me, eating 0-500 calories a day, I lose around 4 pounds per week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> eating something starchy the night before a REALLY big workout

You know, in the past with showing, I typically wouldn't eat all day prior to my time to compete. However, I felt totally okay competing on an empty stomach/competing with no food in my system that day because I was eating a hearty dinner the night before, like a burrito or a chicken kabob plate with rice and hummus + pita. So eating dinner is something I could consider doing. Or, saving my 500 calories for 1 meal the day of the show, and having that like an hour before I compete. 

a few pieces of candy with me in my pockets (like Hershey's kisses or mini Reese's cups) so if I feel like I'm going to pass out I can quickly spike my blood sugar.

I kinda do this now. Well, I had been doing this prior to starting keto. I'd be coming off from a 36 hour fast, getting ready for a horse riding lesson. So I'd have a 100 cal granola bar to spike my blood sugar so I don't die during my lesson lmao

Thank you so much for all the advice and tips! I'll definitely take these things into consideration. I'm still not 100% certain if I want to show because ED thoughts are still lingering in my head. My therapist will want to talk me into doing the show, but at the same time, she'll try to talk me out of it if I'm not committed to nourishing myself.

	<TEXT> Thank you for this advice! I was actually thinking, since my limit is 500 calories a day, I could eat that in one meal right before I ride. If I show, I'll be showing in the morning on Friday then the late morning on Saturday. So I guess reverse intermittent fasting in a way! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, it's muscle that gives you more calories. However, if someone is overall obese/overweight, then yes, they have more calories because there is more of them. That's why some obese people can lose weight eating 2000 calories a day, whereas an average person would need ~1200-1400 calories.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay I feel like a loser for posting twice within like, an hour, but something came up and I am genuinely freaking out...

I don't know if any of you remember, but my horse show in April got canceled due to the weather. It's been rescheduled for next weekend and I assumed my barn wasn't going to attend because there were other shows coming up and our main trainer is going out of the country this weekend for like 10 days.

Well, I just got a group barn email and we **will** be doing the show next weekend. On one hand, I'm happy because I haven't shown my horse since November and I love showing. On the other hand, it means I need to fuel myself properly to compete :( and mentally I just can't do that. I can't. I can't I can't I can't. 

Sorry I'm being a negative Nancy here. I just can't believe a) I'm so stressed about *this*. *This* being something I absolutely love aka my #1 passion. And b) I can't believe my eating disorder has gotten *so bad* that I'm considering not doing what I love most, simply because of food. 

Fuck eating disorders, honestly. I have no idea what I'm going to do. I see my therapist tomorrow and I'll talk to her about it, but until then, I'm going to be a big fat ball of stress. 

I hate this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before I start, let me just thank all of you who put up with my drunk posting/commenting last night. I can't even comprehend half of what I wrote. Something about Drake and Rihanna at one point? I love you guys!

Anyways, I saw her about a month ago for a short 20 minute session to get a refill on my beta blocker. During that session, I told her I was fine, that everything was fine, blah blah blah and I was on my way. But I started seeing my ED therapist again and she suggested I see my psychiatrist in addition. So I emailed my psychiatrist, told her I was not honest with her during our last session and am going through an ED relapse. 

My session was good. I feel like she really understands me. She put me back on Prozac to help with the depression aspect of the relapse. If I don't "get better" ED-wise in the next month (our next session is June 1), then she is going to have me get blood work and an EKG done. She said she *really* wanted to write the order today, but she realized it would be too overwhelming for me. I'm **so** happy she understands *that* much and isn't being pushy. She realizes it takes a lot for someone to admit they have a problem and doesn't want to overcorrect too much because it might make things worse.

I also decided I'm going to *try* to start restricting to 500 calories a day with some fasting days here and there. Part of me is recovery minded and a huge part of me is still very much eating disordered. 500 calories is the max I can eat without feeling like shit. While it's still relatively low, it'll probably help me with the idea of reaching a caloric goal or whatever if I ever decide to fully recover. So even if I want to eat 300, I'm still going to aim for 500. Maybe I'll even have more energy to exercise!

I hope you all have had a wonderful day! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't had any alcohol in 17 days. I fucking miss it so much. I'm doing keto and I discovered that tequila has 0 carbs. Sparkling Ice Water is just water + Sucralose (maybe? water with stuff ok, it's 0 cal), essentially, so combine the two and it's a *relatively* low cal cocktail. It's fucking delicious. Unfortunately, that means I've had over 250 calories extra today, bringing my grand total to 557. So basically an entire bottle of Sparkling Ice Water + 3.5-4 shots of tequila (lmao I used my Blender Bottle to measure). But the extra calories are coming from alcohol, so I don't feel as bad. Does anyone else feel less guilty about extra alcohol calories vs extra food calories? Sorry for my f-bomb dropping. I just really love alcohol, ok.

	<TEXT> I *think* I can hit 75g if I make protein a priority, even while eating 300-500 calories a day. We shall see! I am going to see how the rest of this week of keto goes and reevaluate come Sunday. Thank you so much for all your input! 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose I've just been brainwashed by the people of /r/keto! I try to stick to 20g or less of carbs, so I suppose I could get away with splitting my fat and protein evenly. I've noticed I'm bruising really easily, getting muscle spasms and overall I've been in some pain on and off, so I guess it's definitely a sign I need to up my protein. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1000 calories a day is definitely still going to be a deficit for you, so you won't gain. If you do gain, it'll be temporary water weight since it's, as you said, more food than your body is used to. But within a few days your weight will even out 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been thinking about upping my protein, particularly because I find it so hard to stay within the 300-500 range with 65% fat. But I have heard that keto doesn't "work" with more protein. So I'm not sure. As an athlete, I honestly should be eating 40% protein in my diet but with keto that's not going to work. So...as you can see, I'm in quite a bit of a conundrum. Honestly I'm thinking about just saying "fuck it" and living off of protein shakes for the rest of my life! Kidding (kind of)!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So basically you take any quantity of chicken breast/cutlets (for me it's anywhere between 2 oz and 3.5 oz). I soaked it in 1/4 cup lemon juice for 30 min in the fridge. After 30 min, I season the chicken with a mixture of salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and dried parsley. I melt anywhere between half a tablespoon and a full tablespoon of butter in a pan. Once it's melted I add the remaining lemon juice and just cook the chicken in it! Oh, I allow the lemon/butter mixture to thicken a bit before adding the chicken. But not too thick or it'll like, evaporate haha. Yesterday I also added arugula (cooked in the lemon/butter concoction) but I forgot how bitter arugula is on its own, so it was almost inedible with the lemon. I'm thinking of switching to spinach instead of arugula next time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Logically I know that fat doesn't make you fat. I know that, in reality, excess calories is what makes you fat. Don't get me wrong, I love keto. I feel fuller despite eating more calorie dense foods and I don't feel bloated after eating. My stomach still looks concave even if I've had a 250 calorie fatty meal!

But then my ED brain/body dysmorphia makes me look in the mirror after my keto meal and all I see is...fat. Fat everywhere. Fat thighs, fat lower belly, fat arms. I don't know how to shake this feeling. I don't know what to do. Yet I don't want to go back to carbs, because bloating/water weight/etc. But eating fat makes me feel fat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So today I looked up how much exactly and I was stunned. Every day, a volume of water equivalent to twice your entire blood volume is secreted into the interior of your gut! It can be as much as fifteen pounds of water a day!

OH MY GOD I'M SCREAM. I can't believe this! It makes me feel a little better but I still can't believe!!! I kind of also have been questioning the whole sodium thing. I remember once I was restricting to 400 calories and I had 1 cup of soup. The amount of sodium I consumed for the whole day, according to MFP, was ~60% less than the recommended, but I was still up 0.4 pounds in the morning! Everyone said "oh it's sodium, soup has a lot of sodium", while that's true, I really didn't consume that much sodium the entire day.

12-48 hours later when the food finally reaches the large intestine.

I also had no idea that it takes *that* long for food to reach the large intestine. That also makes me feel a bit better!

Babe you are seriously such a rockstar! Thank you SO much for this, always being there for me and always going into detail 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to. In the past when I'd restrict, I would have absolutely no problem eating normally if a social setting called for it. Like, if my friends invited me out to lunch, I would have a totally normal lunch with them and even some dessert. I wouldn't necessarily reach maintenance calories so I never gained *much* weight outside of water weight from the carbs and sodium in the meal. I would happily go back to restricting the following day and restrict until another social event came up. I was much happier back then, infinitely more social and I still lost weight. However, I am currently at point where I avoid *all* social settings. I do this despite knowing I'm not *actually* going to gain weight, and I have the ability to go back to restricting the following day with no harm done.  </TEXT>
