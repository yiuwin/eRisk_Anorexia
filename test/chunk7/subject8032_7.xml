	<TITLE> Lord of the Rings Influenced Star Trek? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> New to this subreddit but I've had a nagging question in my mind for a while that I thought startrek fans would be best equipped to answer.

Are there any major influences in Star Trek from Lord of the Rings?

I'll expand on the sense in which I'm asking. Primarily I'm wondering if parallels between Tolken's Elves and Vulcans (ie. tall, pointy eared, physiologically superior to humans, committed to aesthetics, isolationist, etc etc) are just in my head, or whether they might be hints at an underlying influence when ideas for different species in the star trek universe were being conceived. 

In the same vein:

Tellarites remind me of dwarves (stout, argumentative, bearded)
Orions - the way the males were shown in enterprise S4E4 "Borderlands" reminded me a lot of post-tolken orcs (ie. something out of WOW or Elder Scrolls)... giant bald and green skin.

All I'm saying is that if Humans, Orions, Vulcans, and Tellarites each individually crash landed on a Minshara class planet and lived there for a few hundred or thousand years, it might end up looking like middle earth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've played it a bit. I can't guarantee you'll love it, and I will say that it's not as well fleshed out as their baseball offering... similar idea but a different game. There's no 3D modelling of the games, it's basically play by play, but they now have NHL licensing which is nice.

Overall, depending on how big a blow the price tag of the game is, if it's not too big a deal to spend the money I'd recommend giving it a try. </TEXT>
