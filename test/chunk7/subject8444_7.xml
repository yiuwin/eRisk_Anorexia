	<TEXT> So I'm trying to convince my bosses at work to show all the Quakes game and nationally aired MLS games. Just curious if there is many other places in SF (especially around the union square area) that folks go to watch the games. I'm trying to do my part to grow the sport, and could use the community's help.

Edit: I haven't talked to the bosses yet, but I am working tonight, so if you are in the City and want a place to watch the season opener (Timbers vs Minnesota) come out to Jasper's Corner Tap   Kitchen at 401 Taylor St. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> STO 2 vs reworking the current system? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-02 23:15:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As most of know this game is great and we love it for one reason or another. But it is also known that there are a number of bugs and issues that require fixing, but probably due to the code work makes it very difficult to get it all done, if even possible. So what is the solution? A complete overhaul? Piecemeal patch work? STO 2?

Would you want a totally revamped system but lose everything you currently have? I don't see STO 2 coming for a while, as Cryptic just launched on consoles. But would love to hear your thoughts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciate Herculez having my back, Wondolowski said. But its more a sense that I havent done enough because Ive been on the field those years, for the last seven years, and I havent done enough to get us to (a championship) and Ive been the captain. So to be honest, I think a lot of that is on me  I havent done enough necessary to be successful.

Dude has so much class. He has carried the team since 2012 and still be thinks he hasn't done enough for the club. Couldn't be prouder to have him as our captain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Easiest would be to do tour of the galaxy mission daily. Based on your ship setup and died you can get 500 - 900k (according to some). With my current deep I can knock out beta quadrant with few mistakes for about 500k.

Obviously if you are willing to drop money getting keys and what not is the quickest, but if you are taking about grinding.

Doing admiralty and doff missions work well too. </TEXT>

Or any basic internet search and you could learn so much outside of your narrow minded food choices. Just look at the bloody pictures and you can see the difference between "american" tacos and what they are meant to be.

If you like taco bell's taco, good for you, but that isn't close to authentic. </TEXT>
