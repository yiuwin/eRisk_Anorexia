	<TITLE> [TECH] Game streaming to windows 10 suffers from lag every 2 minutes...any recommended fix? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-21 02:04:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a my xbox one hardwired to my ASUS rt-88u (baller router) and my laptop and surface connected 5ghz.  I can stream, but almost exactly every 2 mintues or so it will 'skip' frames for about 15 seconds, then 'catch up', like i fast forwarded the skipped frames.  it will say 'network problems' at the bottom when it does this.  I had the rt 68u and it did the exact same thing, upgrading to the 88u didn't change a thing.  What the heck?  I should be able to stream on very high with zero problems.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

My laptops are asus g751jy and a surface pro 4m, and it happens exactly the same on both laptops.

Also, i am using the xbox wireless adapter for the controller...if that matters. </TEXT>

The others, square with no handles, which are always in contaminated areas, are chests that only lvl 30dz or above can open, which do not require keys, hence them being called, ' 30 chests'.  These will only drop purple. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> SOLVED (for me at least) Can FINALLY turn off and on xbox from xbox app (win 10) and smart glass. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-04 02:41:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Alot of people are having problems getting the windows 10 app and smartglass to turn off and on the xbox one since the nxoe.  I just tried something.  My console is hardwired, but my laptop, surface, and ios (smartglass) connect via wireless on the same router....
here's what worked for me:
Turn on xbox one. 
unplug network cable.
go to network app, select the ssid that your laptop/phone are connected to.
wait for it to connect.
verify all is good by doing somthing internet based.
reconnect lan cable
go to network and verify its now connected lan.
restart phone/laptop. (may not be needed)
try turning on/off the xbox one via smartglass, xbox app
it should work!

Hope this helps other! </TEXT>
