	<TEXT> Couldn't agree more. He was sensational a couple of years ago when he had a run. I have a feeling that Spencer   Wiggy may well rotate starts this year with De Kock as the bench option; I've heard rumours that this *might* be his last season. 

If it is the case, that's quite some experience going to be departing with Sir Charles, Ernie, De Kock   Burger (allegedly)

Although it's worth saying the amount of appearances a number of the younger players have made is ridiculous: Kruis, George, Farrell are all well north of 100, Fraser's getting close, the Vunipola's aren't far away. 

It's just the next layer of youngster are going to need to be blooded soon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that slightly undersells just how important he's been for us. He made a couple of errors last season, but also won us many, many more matches. Leicester game aside, he's been flawless this year. He's almost certainly the finest keeper I've seen in a Watford shirt. Ben Foster is probably the closest competition.  </TEXT>

If Callum Wilson can get fit I'd happily have him. As long as he stopped falling over ALL THE TIME in the box. Arter is a decent player too. 

edit: Costa would be good. Hazard as well. Cahill would be decent back up for Prodl/Britos   Cathcart

	<TEXT> Watford...Est. 188ish. Played at Vicarage Road since 1927. Rivals: Historically, Luton Town. But they're rubbish. Something of a modern rivalry with Palace   Leicester. Most Watford supporters don't like Arsenal   Spurs as they're local, but they don't really care about us. 

Highest ever finish was 2nd in the pre-Premier League top division in 1983. It was followed by an FA Cup final appearance in 1984. 

Best ever manager is Graham Taylor who took us from the old Division 4 to runners up in 6 seasons. Then returned in 1997 to take us from league 1 back into the Premier League.

Greatest Ever Player is probably Luther Blissett, highest ever goalscorer who played for the club in the 70s, 80s   90s. Closely followed by John Barnes. Of the modern crop, Troy Deeney has become the first player to score 20 goals in 3 consecutive seasons. He's unlikely to get 20 this year, but is the talismanic captain who the club persevered with after he went to jail for kicking a student's head in. He's rewarded that with an absurd level of performance. 


Fun Fact! We're owned by the same people as Udinese   Granada. We've benefited from a number of players such as Odion Ighalo (Udinese), Almen Abdi (Udinese)   Allan Nyom (Granada)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Erm, my limited understanding is that they were promoted because, essentially, Gary Johnson (at Yeovil) is a managerial genius, and in spite of zero money. 

Essentially, that luck has run out. They're a very, very small club with finances commensurate with that, and they now appear to be on the verge of returning from where they emerged in non-league. 

Hopefully, that won't be the end of a proud old club though.  </TEXT>

The Globe is magnificent as well. 

For evening activities,  you cab usually pick up cheapish tickets for West End musicals on the day, if he's into that.

As my understanding of doping goes,  by the time that the athletes have got to a competition like the Olympics, they wouldn't have taken anything for some time, but already derived the benefits. That's why the out of competition testing is so important. 

As it goes, I'm not convinced that the entire British team is as clean as it like to claim, and I find it very hard to believe that across the major sports in the UK (football, rugby (both codes), athletics etc) so few sportsmen   women are caught for anything other than recreational drug use.  </TEXT>

 Compounded by a visit the following Boxing Day which saw the game being the only one in the South of England called off for frost, and took me 4 hours to get home from on the M25.

	<TEXT> I played full back at Sunday league level, both left   right. I was a workable, if overly defensive midfielder   serviceable centre back in a back four. 
However, I have never, ever been so confused as when played as a central midfielder. Absolutely no idea where I was supposed to be at all. Just ran around like a headless chicken. 

Had a similar experience as a centre back in a back three - admittedly because I had no cover from the winger   had no idea whether to go with the opposing winger or centre forward. 

Essentially, you need to train/watch positions to do them well.  </TEXT>
