	<TEXT> A husband and wife who work for the circus go to an adoption agency. Social workers there, raise doubts about the living conditions in a circus, but the couple produce photos of their 50-foot luxury motor home, which is clean and well-maintained and equipped with a beautiful nursery.

The social workers also raise concerns about the education a child would receive while in the couple's care. "We've arranged for a full-time tutor who will teach the child all the usual subjects along with French, Mandarin and computer skills."

Then the social workers express concern about a child being raised in a circus environment. "Our nanny is a certified expert in pediatric care, welfare and diet."

The social workers are finally satisfied and ask, "What age child are you hoping to adopt?"

"It doesn't really matter as long as the kid fits in the cannon."

	<TITLE> No Name Toilet paper </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> An Indian walks into a trading post and asks for toilet paper. The clerk asks if he would like no name, Charmin, or White Cloud. "White Cloud sounds like good Indian toilet paper," says the Indian. "How much is it?" "$1.00 a roll," the clerk replies. "That seems pretty expensive," responds the Indian. "What about the others?" "Charmin is $2.00 a roll, and no name is 50 cents a roll." 

 The Indian doesn't have much money, so he opts for the no name. Within a few hours, he is back at the trading post. "I have a name for the no name toilet paper," he announces to the clerk. "We shall call it John Wayne." "Why?" asks the confused clerk. "Cause it's rough and it's tough and it don't take no shit off an Indian. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Donald Duck and Daisy Duck were spending the night 
together in a hotel room and Donald wanted to do some 
'horizontal dancing' with Daisy.
The first thing Daisy asked was, "Do you have a condom?"
Donald frowned and said, "No."
Daisy told Donald that if he didn't get a condom, they 
could not do the 'wild thing'.
"Maybe they sell them at the front desk," she suggested.
So Donald went down to the lobby and asked the hotel clerk 
if they had condoms.
"Yes, we do," the clerk said and pulled a box out from 
under the counter and gave it to Donald.
The clerk asked, "Would you like me to put them on your bill?"
"Thit No!" Donald quacked, "I'll thuffocate!"
