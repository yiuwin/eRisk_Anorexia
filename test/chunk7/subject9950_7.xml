	<TEXT> Keep in mind that Marvel had no idea what to do after Daredevil Season 2 was green lit.  There were rumors that Iron Fist was going to be cancelled.  Scott Buck obviously came along and pitched Harold Meachum having been resurrected by the Hand and then him being killed by his son and then coming back to life.  It was a good pitch.  He must have pitched a good story for Inhumans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane

I can see the red tail lights heading for K'UN L'UN

Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye

God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

They say K'UN L'UN is pretty though I've never been

Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen

Oh and he should know, he's been there enough

Lord I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much

Daniel my brother you are older than me

Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal

Your eyes have died but you see more than I

Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky

Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane

I can see the red tail lights heading for K'UN L'UN

Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye

God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

Oh God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your theory can't be right because Barry is Flashpoint Barry: he still remembers what happened during Flashpoint.  That is, unless you mean the Barry that Barry replaced when he went to the future except that Barry didn't have super speed.  That Barry would have simply ceased to exist when our Barry replaced him (which is why he started gaining his memories).  He wouldn't have gone on to get the Philosopher's Stone and become Savitar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Close.  Savitar is Barry after his mom dies a second time.  Remember how Julian hated Barry and how Cisco was pissed off at him?  That's probably because that Barry was an asshole.  Consider.

Barry goes back in time.  He saves his mom.  Barry returns to the present.  His mom and dad are still alive but now he is no longer the Flash and he is losing his memories from when he grew up with Iris.  Finally he sends Thawne back and has him kill his mom.  Now the timeline changes a second time but he still has his memories of how things were the first time.

So what happened to the Barry that met Julian in the lab and whom Julian didn't like?  Did that Barry cease to exist?  Or was that Barry then trapped in the speed force and became Savitar?

The only problem with this theory is how the Philosopher's Stone comes into it.  It really is a problem with all the Barry-is-Savitar theories because we see a flashback of a big muscular guy getting his speed from the Philosopher's Stone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in the early nineties I went to Chinatown in Montreal and I found a store that rented videos.  They had some stuff I hadn't seen before such as an old Kristara Barrington VHS in which she was (unfortunately) getting raped and some stuff that just had Chinese characters on it.  

"What's this?" I asked.

"You don't want that," the store clerk said.

"What is it?" I asked again.

"It's not in English," I was told.

"Sounds like what I'm looking for," I said.

"If you rent all four will you return them the next day?" she asked.

"I'll watch them one after the other," I said.

"Okay.  You bring them back same time tomorrow."

The tapes were modified for the Hong Kong market in that they were dubbed into Chinese and had English subtitles.  The only indication that they were Japanese originally was the fact that all the signs were in Japanese.  The stories covered all the basic Japanese porn tropes: a man broke into a woman's house to steal from her but then found her sleeping and raped her; a young high school girl seduces her tutor while, meanwhile, her best friend is molested by her dad; a young waitress has sex with her boyfriend in the morning, arrives at work late and gets raped by her boss and a young mother feels frustrated by her husband's lack of attention and has sex with her oldest son.  I have no idea who the actresses were.

My reaction was "meh".  One thing about Western porn is that if you look at a lot of soft core print magazines you will see a lot of porn stars doing photo shoots and it adds a level of excitement when you see a porn star getting fucked after seeing her naked in a lot of different magazines and fantasizing about her.  My first experience with Japanese porn didn't have that kind of pay off.  Plus it was all about incest, rape and sex with underaged partners so, of course, the scenes involved a lot of crying.

My next experience with Japanese porn was in the Philippines.  My wife and I were on our honeymoon in Manila and we were on a budget so we stayed in a cheap hotel.  (When I arrived at the hotel, my wife was a few steps behind me and the hotel manager said "Do you need a girl?" and then saw my wife and said "Oh, never mind, you've already brought one.")   We went to the hotel room and turned on the TV expecting cable.  There was no cable.  Instead it was a constant feed of Japanese porn.  Best.  Honeymoon.  Ever.

My third experience with Japanese porn was when I first got a job in Taiwan.  They had a premium channel that was blocked to people unless you paid extra.  Thing is, I was at a local hardware store and I saw a device on the counter with Chinese characters on it that said "Premium cable channel descrambler".  I held it up to the man at the counter and said in Chinese "Seriously?" and he explained in broken English that I could simply screw the device into the wall and attach the cable to it and I would be able to see the premium channel with Japanese porn.  I was able to watch Japanese porn for about a month but then it stopped working, probably because they used a different scrambling technique every few months to prevent people from getting the channel for free this way.

Long story short, my exposure to Japanese porn had left me with the impression that Japanese porn wasn't that great.  It wasn't until I was able to get high speed internet access at home that I started appreciating it and even then it was the Red Hot series mostly because that stuff was uncensored.  Then I started buying some censored Japanese soap land porn and some Yuki Jin videos.  (Uncensored Japanese porn is hard to find in Taiwan.)   I was reluctant to download stuff from JavDownloadCenter because files over 1G take a long time to download and take up a lot of diskspace but then I started downloading Kurea Hasumi videos.  I moved on to other actresses when I had downloaded all the Kurea Hasumi videos I could find and I still had space on my computer.  I bought a 1 TeV drive and then a 2 TeV drive and I must have between one and two TeVs of Japanese porn on those drives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Danny Rand's mother, Heather Rand.

Evidence:

1) We never see the body of Danny Rand's mother.  No body means no death.  Danny even says that he imagined his mother had somehow survived.

2) At no time did the Hand ever seriously try to kill Danny Rand.  This suggests that someone in the Hand wanted Danny alive.  Remember how in Episode 8 Gao ordered to have "the women" killed?  Danny, apparently, was not to be harmed.  Why?

3) Both Gao and Bakuto mentioned a "master" who was interested in Danny Rand.

4) Harold Meacham didn't know that Gao was using Rand Corporation to sell drugs.  Obviously Ward didn't know either.  So who authorized Gao to have access to a floor in the Rand Corporation building?  Could it have been something Heather Rand had set up before the plane crash?

5) Harold was brought back to life and then told that he couldn't leave his penthouse or else Joy Meacham would be killed.  That sounds very personal.  Did Heather Rand realize that Harold Meacham had tried to have her family killed in the airplane crash?

6) Everybody assumed that Gao contacted Heather Rand and got her involved with the Hand.  What if it was actually Heather Rand that recruited Gao into the Hand? </TEXT>

It would explain why the Hand didn't kill Danny even though they had chances.  Remember when Gao said "Kill the women"?  Why let Danny live? </TEXT>

Then again, the budget for the Marvel Netflix shows is minimal so the door will just be a literal door. </TEXT>

Cap in the movies is young because he was frozen for 70 years but his character will age as Chris Evans ages which means that he will have to give up being Captain America at some point.  I can't imagine Tony Stark being okay with Bucky taking up the mantle of Captain America though, let alone using the shield that his father made.  It's okay if we don't actually have a Captain America after Avengers 4. </TEXT>

It's like when people have one drop of African heritage suddenly they have to say they are black when they fill in a form.  The only time I ever had to state a race was when I applied to work in the U.S.  In other countries, by law, you're not even allowed to ask that question.  It's fucked up.  We're human beings.

	<TEXT> On the other hand, if they really had been considering Lewis Tan for the role of Danny Rand then they were clearly considering the idea of making Danny Rand mixed Asian / white American.  Not making Danny Rand mixed now seems like a last minute change.  Presumably they hired Finn Jones for the part and decided that nobody would buy Finn Jones as (to use your horribly racist term) a "hapa" so they went and made Heather Rand a white woman.

It's a blunder.  It's like when they made Johnny Storm black but his sister was white so they had to say they she was adopted.  This kind of thing bothers me.  In a movie where people can flame on and turn invisible or a TV show where a man can punch through walls are we really going to quibble about a white woman having a black brother or a white guy having a Chinese mother?  It isn't as though they hired someone Tibetan to play Davos.  I mean, okay, so he's going to come back as a villain in Season 2 so maybe it's just as well they didn't hire a Chinese American actor for that part.

My son is mixed Asian / white Canadian.  I would have liked for him to have had a role model in Danny Rand.  At least you guys have Benedict Wong playing Wong in Doctor Strange.  It's really disappointing that there are no Asian male heroes on the TV side.  You have Melinda May on Agents of SHIELD and Tina Minoru on Runaways and you even have a mixed Asian / white American character in Daisy / Skye / Quake.  Even Stick is played by a white guy.  A white guy who was born in Asia and had his family killed by the Hand.  It's like they aren't even trying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I will probably get down voted for this but I think Iron Fist hurt the Marvel Netflix brand so that while we probably will get a second season of Iron Fist it will be the last season.  We will probably also only get one more season of Jessica Jones, one more season of Luke Cage and a couple more seasons of Daredevil.  

One problem is the lack of compelling source material.  The Jessica Jones series was a hit because David Tennant's Killgrave was a compelling villain.  I suspect Season 2 to double down on the Trish Walker character because her desire to become a superhero was so interesting in Season 1 that it would make sense for them to capitalize on that in Season 2 and give her a bigger role.

Another problem is the fact that Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist are not as popular as Captain America, Iron Man and the Hulk.  If they were then you would have seen Luke Cage and Iron Fist movies on the big screen.  They have become more popular characters because Marvel has been promoting them in response to the Netflix deal but if the three series all come back for a second season each and the response is lukewarm then none of them will get a third season.

I think we will get two more seasons of Daredevil.  Daredevil Season 3 will probably adapt the Born Again storyline except it will have Bullseye instead of Nuke.  That will be a hit and spawn a fourth season.  But then I think the last season of Daredevil will set up a second season of Defenders which will wrap up all the Defenders story lines.

The Punisher is pretty much a separate thing.  Maybe we will get a Thunderbolts spin off.  Maybe we will get an Elektra series, a Moon Knight series and a Spider-Woman series.  Marvel and Netflix will continue to have a working relationship but I think continuing the existing Defenders series after Phase 2 is going to be a hard sell.  </TEXT>
