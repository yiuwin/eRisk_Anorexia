	<TEXT> Forklift driver is experienced and understands how to drive it.  He has 2 hours worth of propane.  

Gladiator is armed with a typical roman sword and that's all. 

Both are bloodlusted and will try to kill the other without question, fight takes place on a 1 acre flat parking lot  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think I want to take a safety with our pick.  We have 3 good ones.  I don't think Lattimore is good enough to be top 5.  If you pick a DB top 5 they gotta be like a Ramsey or Peterson type player and I don't think anybody in this draft is.  

Also I really want Cooper Kupp in the 3rd round.  I want Desmond King in the 3rd round if he slides.  I want Corey Davis at 18 if possible.  I want Zach Cunningham if he slides  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because people shouldn't be plastic fans.  I don't care how many shirts you buy.  How many games you watch on a tv.  How many players you know.  It's so stupid to be a fan of a team 5,000 miles away when there is entertaining soccer that is arguably a top 7-15ish league in the world right next door.

He's not  good decision maker, he can't hit the side of a barn, and he almost got benched his senior year.  That's 3 massive red flags.  I mean honestly go watch the South Carolina, Vanderbilt, and Appalachian state game from his senior year alone.

	<TEXT> I don't understand this fascination with San Diego in regard to MLS.  Could be a good market?  I'm sure it would be, however I don't think it really has anything significant that any of the other major expansion markets don't have.  The biggest arguments I see is tv ratings and population size.  Population of SD isn't anything major, compared to other cities in expansion lists.  SD is a big city but it's not a Chicago or LA by any means.  Tv ratings don't = actual MLS success.  Dallas is top 5 in soccer ratings for tv and look at their team.  Orlando is like 27th or something, look at their team.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is just my opinion but I think people over value the size of immigrants in fan bases for MLS teams.  Are they there?  Sure they are, but I don't think they make or break a MLS team.  The vast majority of fans don't come from south/Central American immigrants.  In my experiences they care way more about European soccer anyway.   </TEXT>

I respect the crap out of Mighty Mouse because he's one of the best fighters ever, but that doesn't mean I enjoy watching him fight because I don't.
