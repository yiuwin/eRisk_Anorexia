	<TEXT> The word is an mixture of "wider" and "sins". "Wider" means against, in some old Middle German language, and "sins" comes from Scottish "sin", or sun. It also is direction in the Middle German language. Putting everything together gives "against sun direction."

This is according to google dictionary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well you could pinpoint scientists here and there. Newton for mechanics, Einstein for relativity, but otherwise, there's no other field on the same level of generality as EM for which you can find a single physicist as the root of all. 

Even these two are arguable: Einstein because although he developed the equations, Chandrasekhar and Schwarzschild, among others, provided solutions. Newton because his work relied heavily on Kepler and Galileo. Nonetheless, they took apparently separate patches and wove them into a tapestry much longer than its string. When someone is able to do this, they go down in history as the greatest genius humanity has ever known. 

Electromagnetism, quantum mechanics and thermodynamics were developed by multiple scientists contributing to it. Maxwell's synthesis of EM, while very useful and impressive, doesn't quite match the level of independence that Newton and Einstein demonstrated; part of his work is simply a restatement of others' laws, such as Gauss' laws. QM has Planck, Bohr, Sommerfield, Feynman and countless other who worked, and are still working on it. Thermodynamics has Carnot, Kelvin, Boltzmann and plenty of others as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also think it might have something to do with weight. The stereotypical neckbeard guy is overweight, so that their chin deforms and merges with their neck. Without shaving it looks like their beard ends up on their neck entirely, forming a sort of beard collar. 

I shave rarely -about once a month perhaps, or when there is some important event. I'm lazy, and I never leant how to shave properly, because I didn't grow up with my dad. I'm not good with yielding a blade to not cut a throat, much better cutting other people's throats. I'm young enough to look a bit scruffy, at least. Either way when my beard grows, it grows on the under-chin, but not on my neck.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help with picking transparent feed pen </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-26 15:34:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello. I've seen and heard about transparent feed pens, and I love the way one can see the ink filling the feed. I'm interested in getting one, and I was wondering if you could recommend one. 

My budget is about $50, but I can go a bit higher if I really need to. I don't really care about filling mechanism. I would prefer if the body was transparent as well, or translucent. As long as I can see the ink, I don't mind (I use black most often). I don't need perfect performance, but I would expect a certain standard.

Thanks for any answers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No seriously. That's not sentimentalism. I really like the look. Well perhaps it was a bit of an exaggeration. But the only pens that I find better looking are the Namiki Maki-e branch, and those are extremely expensive. And perhaps Mont Blanc Meisturstucks come close, but again, expensive. 
I don't see myself buying pens for $600 + for quite a while, and I actually prefer the look of the Metro over any pen below that range. The look is classic.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I nearly lost my Pilot Metropolitan Classic Black today. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-25 16:22:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello. 

My Metro is an awesome pen that wrote perfectly smooth, until this incident. I've had for about a month and a half. 

I was using my Metro today when the nib started to feel less smooth. It kept on feeling less and less smooth until it stopped writing altogether. The Metro generally behaves that way when it has no ink so I check the cartridge: half full, which is unsurprising considering that I had changed it only a few hours before. I tried squeezing the cartridge to confirm that ink was flowing: it was. 

I start to despair. I keep on trying to get the pen to write, and it starts to make little ink marks again. Very faint and sporadic marks, but still, it was writing. I guessed that the tines may have been spread apart, so I gently press down on the nib and draw little semi-circles on a piece of a paper, a technique recommended by jetpens. Between wiping ink off to check the nib, this, and the cartridge squeezing my palms start to look  like I operate coal trains. But I'm so desperate that I can't care by now. It didn't work on either of my multiple trials. 

The pen displays no symptoms of the other conditions on the website. Out of sheer desperation and frustration, I press the nib down on the paper. Hard. Surprisingly it works. I deduce that the pen had some rough edges, which wouldn't really make sense because I did nothing that would roughen the edges. So I try the figure 8 trick, still pressing hard. I try the pen afterwards, pressing lightly. The pen writes! Except that it wrote really large, like a Western B even though it is a Japanese M, and it stops after a few seconds of writing. 

I'm practically on the verge of crying now(the pen is special to me), but I try to think up possible causes. I run a train of thought: the pen doesn't write normally, but when I release a lot of ink through, the ink flows unhindered. When I press hard, and spread the tines, the pen writes for a little before stopping. It wrote as if it was running out of ink. Therefore, something must have been blocking the ink flow. An obstruction wouldn't be able to block the entirety of a large ink flow, which would explain why the pen wrote when I pressed the tines apart.

I expectantly take my syringe, and use the needle to clean the ink channel; the pen actually works! The ink channel was dirty, or so I think. There's no actual reason why it would be dirty unless it was through normal use. 

The pen means a lot to me, because it was my first "middle class" fountain pen (my first fountain pen is a cheaper pen, that works well, but that is outclassed by the Metro by far), and because it is a gift for my eighteenth birthday from my mom. It is the first pen I poured all my time and heart into choosing, and it is the pen that got me to use fountain pens whenever I could. It is my favourite pen, and it probably is the most beautiful pen I'll ever own. I actually would have given up on the pen because importing it here costs $40 extra, but by sheer unexpected luck, I got it locally for about $22. I'm really happy it's working right now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I 100% agree with this. I've never been one to collect anything, never for this precise reason. Once you have too many, you can't attend to all of them. But I feel that pens are different for God knows what reason. Maybe because I like them too much to stop.

That being said, when I buy a pen, I don't buy only for looks, I buy it for its unique characteristics. Each different model has their own charm. If I buy a Lamy Al-Star, I'm not getting another. If I get a VP, I'm not buying another. As long as a pen is working, I don't buy another pen of the same model, because I feel that it is insulting the pen I already own. I've also set up a system, where I ensure that in a week, each pen I own gets used. This makes sure that none are neglected.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard that about the public schooling too. I think that's more characteristic of the level of the education rather than the country. Such a broad focus in such little time with a huge focus on exams means you don't get to learn stuff in-depth, and not learning stuff in-depth is not something to do. 

I can definitely see how the differences in tertiary education will benefit me. The American education system is the most suited one for a science after all. 

Thanks for the encouragement by the way. 
 
You should try coming here one of these days. You could tour the country in a few days; it is veeeeery small compared to the US. 

I've never travelled to the US yet, for some reason, and I've stopped travelling for the moment, till I leave for my studies. Somehow next year, I'll get there I guess.

	<TEXT> Nah kidding. I did use a word processor to count the words, I'm not crazy. I'm not on windows though, so it wasn't word. 

Believe me, the education here is the worst you could possible find. Tertiary education, High School, whatever, its just terrible. There's no way to express it until you've experienced it. I actually thought that the education here was incredibly bad, before I actually experienced what uni here would be (I didn't enrol, I'm still in high school, but I attended talks for students by high ranking local professors). Whatever I thought was proven to be wrong: it was much worse. 

USA education may seem questionable, but at least in the field I'm pursuing (physics), it's top-notch. American education is different from European standards, and this difference is exactly what's needed to learn a science properly, at least in my opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the post. I'm currently planning to study in America, so I will be leaving next year. Not in NY though, the opposite end, California. This post really gives an insight in costs. 

And I trumped you in length. I wrote 910 words vs 863 words (God we just typed essay length posts.) But I swear, I'm not exaggerating about good contractors. If anything I'm underestimating the difficulty. Clothing too, is a huge headache. There aren't any bargain stores here. Moving stores (basically selling stuff from a van, illegal of course), are cheaper, but you can't find them easily, and anyway quality is not great. Actual stores are either expensive and moderate quality, or cheap and poor quality. 

Paying over 2000 dollars a month for electricity is absolutely crazy. Especially when over half of it is taxed. There's a monopoly here too, but at least it doesn't cost an arm and a leg, and the remaining two limbs with the kidneys on the side to pay. And the medical bills are also insane. $600 for insurance, which you may or may not use, and which is unreliable when you need it is pretty much robbery. I just hope that the medical services are top-notch. At this rate better go to medical school and become a doctor yourself. 

Taxes are not too bad for the moment. There are taxes for most things, but they aren't terrible either. They'll be on the rise, probably. Government has changed, and implemented policies and measures that are depleting the country's money. 

I wasn't talking about organic tomatoes. Just tomatoes with less pesticides. You'd be lucky to find organic vegetables here. Actually even if you did, don't buy it. Organic pesticides are less toxic, but because it is an unregulated industry here, farmers just spray the stuff like there is no tomorrow, resulting in a toxicity level even worse than regular pesticides. Also, one can stick organic on anything, even if it is not organic. Plantations are also very close to each other, so most non-organic pesticides get blown on the organic crops anyway. 

I was talking about local species of fish, or canned fish from the East. Non-local fish is available, but it is not fresh, and it is very expensive. 

Tap water is undrinkable here as well. And I mean undrinkable. Animal corpses marinate in it. I luckily get water from the cleanest reservoir of the island, but I need to boil it, filter it and add iodine solution to make it drinkable. You're better off with bottled water. 

Minimum wage in NY is much better than here. It's half a dollar per hour. You do get some government support, but it is minimal. Not a liveable wage. 

But at least it sounds like I won't be too alienated in the US.

	<TEXT> Thanks for the in-depth answer. I'm looking for a rather free-flowing ink, because I wanted to smoothen my VP, so I guess Sheaffer is not for me. 

I personally found the Lamy to be surprisingly dark. Based on photos, I expected it to be less dark, but I was pleasantly surprised when I used it. It's true that the Camlin ink is not very dark. 

I actually did try using Parker Quink Washable Blue in my Parker Vector. It didn't work very well. The pen was rather smooth ...when it wrote that is. Was skipping quite often. I think the pen needs a rather wet ink to write. It exhibited worse skipping and hardstarted with the Lamy ink, but after adding a drop of soap, the pen writes very smoothly indeed with no issues whatsoever. I suppose it would have the same interaction with Quink Black. 

I have never personally used Quink Black, but I have seen it in action: my teacher uses it. It looks like an average black ink. It might be my best choice. I think I should compare it to the Waterman ink actually. 

But some of those inks in the jetpens website you gave me are really beautiful. Take-Sumi, both Perle Noires and the Aurora black are absolutely gorgeous. I hopefully did find a cheaper shipping option from England (10 vs $40). If my testing doesn't return good results, I'll try and order.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good luck with the research. I've never done research online on the COL here (I don't see why I would, I get my data firsthand.) but I'm guessing it's not easy. 

It's probably cheaper in terms of overall cost than NY, but then again, pays are much lower here compared to USA. But American money does well in conversion for here: whatever money you have, you have 35 times more here. 

Also depends on the lifestyle. You could go for local products, but for most items, that's not a good choice. In general the local products are of a low quality. Vegetables for instance, have toxically high pesticide levels. It's best to buy from select producers or imported vegetables. A pack of 4 tomatoes then comes to $6 or so, which is a lot for a local salary. Sugar and tea are top-notch though, the island was notorious for its sugar and tea plantations. 

Meat is a tad more expensive. Chicken and fish are the most common meats, that you can get for a somewhat affordable price. The local chicken does generally have hormone issues, so I don't suggest all brands. The better ones usually cost $5 for 2 chicken breasts, and $10 for a whole chicken. Fish is ok; it's an island after all. Pork here is about $5 for slices of ham,  $9 for more elaborate cuts. Beef is an issue, as it is usually imported, and can sell for $10 a single cut.

Clothing is outrageously expensive over here. You can spend $10 on a piece of clothing that will last two months, and that's cheap. Better quality starts off at $22 if you search hard, but then jumps very quickly to $45 or so. 

Housing is expensive depending on where you go. Coastal region prices are tourist adjusted, so they have a high rent. Prices for commodities also increases by a lot. The mainland regions are hit and miss, as you can get a pretty decent house that's a bit old or needs to be cleaned for a decent price, or a stupidly priced house. Gas prices have recently increased; it's slightly more than a dollar per litre. Cars are expensive though, and public transport is only in the form of busses, that aren't exactly the safest. Hopefully this will change soon because we are planning to introduce a train line -for the past 20 years. Electricity bills aren't that bad, say 8-10 dollars a month for normal use. 

If you are looking to build a house, expect to pay lots of money. Individual contractors are either cheap and bad, good and expensive, or bad and expensive. The middle category is as rare as a unicorn riding a lochness monster, while being juggled in the air by Bigfoot, with the whole thing recorded by the manbearpig. If you want a house that won't fall to pieces after a few months, consult a company. And companies, by default cost a lot. DIY is quite expensive as well. 

Hospital bills are free, and the service is not too shabby. Private hospital bills (called clinics here) are expensive, but you get great service. Medicine is at a middling price. Veterinary bills vary wildly depending on where you go. Avoid ones that work for the local animal "shelter" though. Animal stuff is expensive if you don't them to be destroyed in one day. 

And of course the most important: fountain pens. The fountain pens available here don't offer much of a choice. You have Parker and Sheaffer being the most common. Waterman is a bit rarer, but still around in bigger libraries. Some Pilot pens, like the Metro (classic black M nib only) are available sparingly. Prices are jacked up slightly: for instance, my Metro was about $22, whereas the normal cost is $15. There are Lamy products here, and the prices are actually close to their actual price. I paid the equivalent of $30 for my Al-Star. The choices aren't so diverse, but you get flagship ones: Safari, Al-Star, 2000, and Scala. Limited editions are not available (my poor, poor Pacific Blue). You also get some fountain pens from China (not branded pens), some from France (for children) and some from India. 

Ink choices, as shown by this thread are very limited. You can get Camlin Kokuyo, some Indian (not India) inks, and Quink washable blue and black. Some Chinese unbranded inks are available as well. Ink costs vary wildly, but for the branded ones, like Quink, they stay remarkably close to their actual value, and some like the Kokuyo are cheaper. Lamy ink is also available, in black and blue only. Ink colours aren't diverse: mostly blues and blacks. You might be able to get some better deals in small stores, the country is full of them. Otherwise, most of the inks are found in only one shop, except Quink. 

I don't know any fountain pen aficionados except myself here, and perhaps my dad (not really an aficionado, but he does appreciate fountain pens.) Then again I don't meet people. 

There's a 9 hour difference between here and New York. The official language is English, but the spoken language is Creole, which is based heavily on French. You can find Creole and French speakers, but English speakers aren't really fluent. They can communicate adequately though. After all, the country's main industry is tourism. 

And sorry for the long post. Just giving a few details.

	<TEXT> I added the soap quite recently. I didn't add it in the ink bottle, because that would be stupid. 

I do think I overdid it. It basically turned a Fine VP into something like Western Broad. The ink didn't really noticeably increase smoothness for this one. I don't think I'll do it for the VP again. But it was fun to see the line difference. 

I added some to my Vector as well. It writes much better than before now. There is not much of a line difference, but the pen is really smooth now.

Also added some to my Metro. Probably really overdid it for this one. The Metro's smoothness increased marginally but it went from Japanese M to Western BB. It also leaves ink splotches. I love it a lot actually. 

Thanks for the tip. It's fun seeing what happened.  </TEXT>

I've been trying to find J. Herbin inks, though I was loooking for Diabolo Menthe. I plan to buy it at a future time, so I probably could buy the Perle Noire at the same time. It's not really feasible for me to buy that right now. 


I'm not really into blue inks for the moment, and feathering is an issue, so I probably won't be looking into the Polar Blue. 

Pilot Black might be easier to find, so I could try that. I was thinking about the ink actually. 

I always thought that increasing ink flow would be part of smoothing. I'm pretty sure my nibs are already rather smooth, so I was talking about increasing ink flow when I was talking about smoothing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually the language here is Creole (Mauritian of course), but I ended up speaking English most. 

It's probably hard to ship because of geographical location. From the US, the country is probably around the farthest. It's more or less in the middle of the globe, so for the US it is far. Also taxes and the cost of living here are crazy. 

The country itself is not that bad The country is a bit like a mini-India in terms of looks, behaviour, people ... actually everything but the language. The country is just a few years late. It's a putative tourist resort, and it is great for tourists to visit, because the beaches are great. But policies on the environment are a bit late so if you do wish to see the beaches better hurry up. It's a bit hard to live in because of the cost of living but otherwise not too bad.  </TEXT>

I'm pretty sure my nibs are rather smooth. According to reviews, and my own experience with them, they are actually very smooth. I am actually quite pleased with their performance. But I'm just trying to see if I can improve them. 

I never thought of trying to smooth them out. Thanks for the idea. I'll have a look at how to smoothen them. 

While Iroshizuku inks might be a tad difficult to obtain here (though thanks to the multiple responses on this thread, I have good leads to investigate), I'm pretty sure I can get my hands on Waterman. I'll look into it. 
Just to confirm, have you used Waterman Black, and if so was it smooth?

The tip about the dish soap is interesting. I think I'll try that with the Lamy ink. Does the dish soap need to be mixed with water, or is it straight from the bottle?

	<TEXT> Hello.

I'm trying to find an ink that could increase the smoothness of the writing. I've experienced with a few inks so far, and I'm looking into some other ink. 

I tried Schneider black and Lamy black in the same pen (a Metro). Schneider was smooth in the pen. Lamy seemed to be less smooth, so I switched back to the Schneider, but the smoothness did not change. I kept on trying with Schneider, and I got the original smoothness back. However, I am not sure of whether I was wrongly angling my pen or misremembering the smoothness. 

I also tried Quink washable blue and Lamy Black in a Vector. The Lamy Black seems to write more smoothly than the Quink, but the pen also stalls often for some reason. I do remember it occasionally doing it with the Quink, but I am not sure if my results are again the product of cognitive dissonance. 

I also used Camlin Kokuyo black, Lamy Black and Schneider black in my Vanishing point. Lamy Black seems to be the smoothest, but it seems that the Schneider comes close. 

My Lamy Al-Star with Lamy Black is my smoothest pen. I haven't tried any other ink with it. 

Based on these contradictory results, I surmised the following: Lamy ink is smooth, but does not work that well in all pens. Some pens, like the VP work better with it, while others don't. Why this would be the case I have no idea. 

Another possible conclusion is that the Lamy Black works better with converters than with cartridges. The Metro and the Vector use cartridges, which I cleaned and refilled, and the VP uses a converter. Again, no idea of why this would do that.

Which brings me to this question:

1. If anyone has tried different inks, amongst which there is the Lamy Black, has there been any issues or decrease in smoothness with the Lamy ink?

I'm especially concerned with Quink black and Sheaffer Black, but any experience with other inks will also be useful.

Thank you for replying.



Edit: Thanks to everyone in this sub for answering. After tireless hours of searching the internet, and combing the country, I found an Amazon seller selling Iroshizuku Take-Sumi. Cheaper than usual because it comes directly from Japan. Much smaller shipping fee as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I try to use most pens I have on a rotational basis, so I don't have a signature pen per se. I do however have three pens that stand up above the rest, which could be signature pens:

Pilot Vanishing Point Matte Black Finish Fine nib inked with Lamy Black. Its probably my most used one because its smooth, and its great to use for a student. 

Lamy Al-Star Graphite Fine with Lamy Black. 
Pilot Metropolitan MR Black Medium with Schneider Black (Making a switch to Lamy after the cartridge is over).

The above two get about equal use. 

Then I have two pens that get a considerable amount of use, but not enough to be my signature pens:

Parker Vector Black inked with Lamy Black. Got it a few years back, when I was using fountain pens, but was not into the hobby. Just inked, and writes quite well. Seems to have a few angle problems, so it might not be getting that much use. 

Jinhao x750 Silver coloured inked with Camlin Kokuyo Black (will refill with Lamy Black afterwards - as you can see I am a huge fan of black inks, and Lamy)

	<TEXT> I'd personally believe that all people come at some point where they admit that they don't know something. But anyway, that's not really relevant. Thanks for your respect, information, prayers, and whatever else (not trying to be disrespectful, just too lazy to write everything.) I must also admit that I do admire religious people. Religion has this ability to bring out the best in everyone, and I really like that. Of course, sometimes it brings out the worst, but every upside has its downside. 

I guess it is more appropriate to end the discussion here. We've already exposed our points, and I think that we both got what we wanted. If we do continue, we'll never end. Anyway, we both explained our points of view, so that's enough. No need to try and change each other's ideas. I like to think of each possibility that I gave as equally likely objectively, but subjectively, I do have my own biases. They aren't really justified, so there's no point in talking about them. 

I should be accurate in my knowledge of thermodynamics. I'm aiming to study physics in university and very hopefully get a job in the field, so I need to know my subject matter. 

Thanks for not being offended and for also being open to other points of view. I suppose that you do get heckled a lot for being religious, so whenever you see a comment like the one that started this discussion, you go on automatic defence. I must admit that I did phrase the comment provocatively; a combination of my own automatic defence (Extremists of either religion or irreligion attack others just as much), and just my general lack of tact. I'm a bit blunt with my words, because it's faster that way. 

And now after having turned this sub of fake smarts into an actually smart discussion, I bid goodbye. As long as you aren't leaving Reddit, we probably will encounter each other somewhere.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for answering back.

I'd identify as agnostic myself, and I am trying to be unbiased in the discussion. However, I'm not trying to convince anyone; I'm just stating what I think and reading what you think. 

Now, about trying to explain spiritual matters via materialism. I'd tend to disagree that there are things that cannot be investigated by experiment. One may posit that there is something that we cannot hear or see, but there has to be some way to interact with that something (which I'll call God for simplicity). If there is truly no way to interact with God, then does it matter if God exists or not? It's like Russel's teapot: if there is a teapot so small in outer space that no matter what happens, we will never ever detect it, does its existence matter?

By its undetectable virtue, its existence or non-existence cannot affect us in any way, otherwise we could detect it. But if we can detect it, then it must exist. I'm not saying that God is undetectable. Rather I am saying, that if God exists, then there must be a way to detect God's presence. However this does not necessarily imply that one can show God's existence without a doubt. For instance one might posit that the universe was created by God. In this case, it is an interaction and therefore God would exist. However, if this is completely undistinguishable from some other cause, one cannot rule out which is which. 


It is pedantic, but the laws of thermodynamics are actually:

1. Energy is conserved. Therefore a change in the energy of a closed system is due entirely to the work done and the heat energy. 

2. For any closed system, the entropy must increase, or remain the same. It cannot decrease. 

3. It is impossible for a substance to reach absolute zero.

4. If two objects A and B have the same temperature, and a third object C has the same temperature as A, then B and C have the same temperature as well. 

Out of the laws, the last two are not relevant to us. (I typed them out for the sake of completion. ) That objects tend to stay in motion or tend to stay at rest is actually the law of conservation of momentum, which only partially implies the first law of thermodynamics. More precisely, it is Newton's first law of motion. (I'm not trying to show off or anything, sorry if it comes off as such. I just like talking about physics.) In this case pedantry is necessary. 

First of all, there is a problem with the concept of at rest universally. There cannot be such a thing: if one allows for Newton's first law, and allows for the laws of thermodynamics (specifically the first one), then there is no such thing as absolute motion. 

That is, there is no way of objectively saying that an object moves; one can only specify whether they are moving relative to something else. Thus to posit that the universe is at rest or moving absolutely is to posit that either energy is not conserved and neither is momentum, which means that there is not much reason to posit a Prime Mover. Therefore, whether the universe moves or not does not matter. 

One can furthermore show that the laws of physics had to be the same when the universe was around, if energy is conserved. If energy is conserved, then there is a theorem (Noether's theorem to be exact) stating that the laws of physics cannot change with time. Thus, they must have been the same for all eternity.

Either the universe has always existed, or it was created. 

The eternity of the universe doesn't necessarily imply an infinite entropy. Entropy can either increase or remain the same. It can remain the same if there is no process happening. Entropy will increase as heat flows. If everything is at the same temperature, then no heat will flow. If the universe was in that condition, then it is possible that for an eternity, there was no increase in the entropy. 

Then, one might ask, how did the universe reach this stage, because obviously entropy increases. One might suppose a really small universe. Then quantum effects could cause an inflation, which would trap heat in certain pockets and thus cause a temperature differential. This would be the big bang. (I'm doing a sloppy job explaining this. Sorry.) That's the hypothesis of Lawrence Krauss in his book A Universe from Nothing (I do not endorse or promote him in any way whatsoever. The book's scientific content is nonetheless interesting). 

A multiverse is not necessarily unscientific. There can be ways of detecting the existence of it from this universe. For instance a leak in entropy, or a change in energy could imply that the laws of physics don't work, or that there is something apart from the universe. Of course, some versions of the multiverse propose that it is completely undetectable from here, in which case its existence becomes meaningless.

A universe that begun by itself violates energy conservation, thus sounds impossible. This is without contending with the idea that time and space begun with the big bang. Before that, there was no time and no space, and no time means that there were no unchanging laws of physics, and thus that energy need not be conserved. This allows for a spontaneous universe, and also allows for an infinite universe (without time, entropy cannot increase). 

Of course, each of these explanations have about as much evidence as a Prime Mover. I've given a summary of why different causes are possible but I'm sure someone could find arguments for the Prime Mover as well. The reality of it is that we just don't know. The evidence we have points in all directions, and we need more evidence to confirm anything. I do not know if we will ever be able to establish a true cause, but not knowing whether we will have an answer is half the fun. 

I doubt that I will change your point of view. Anyway, that's not my intention. Its fun having discussions like this. In the end, I don't really think that it matters that much. After all, our knowledge and views are just human matters (the reality is not, but what we know of reality is human matters). And human matters have no definite answer. That's why discussions exist. That's why science exists. That's why religion exists. If I'm going to live without knowing, then I'm going to have fun not knowing. At least that's what I try to do. So discussions like these are fun. 

And I have to thank you for taking your time to reply a kid on the internet (I'm human by the way, not a goat). I also need to thank your courteous tone, and I thank you for sharing your views with me. I don't want to alter your world view. I also apologise if I offended you in any way, it was not and is not my intention. I also might have made seemingly objective statements that can be argued. I understand that these are my point of view and may differ from yours; I wrote them as such for the sake of brevity. 

Note: I know how this seems, but I am not closing the discussion in any way. Feel free to add anything. I'm just tying loose ends I forgot to. But I am not closing the discussion. It's up to you to do so if you wish.

	<TEXT> Honestly, if that was a fountain pen, and someone didn't get more, I would have the same reaction, as a fountain pen aficionado. 

And the person would be in huge trouble because I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with  that shit? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your address is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever apathy was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have ordered my fucking pens. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.

	<TEXT> I thought so. Thanks for confirming. But you still wouldn't be able to evaluate numerical values, like infinity times 0. Only limits of functions, which can change depending on the function.  </TEXT>
