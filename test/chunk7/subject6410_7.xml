	<TEXT> No no! thanks for taking the time to contribute. Its all very useful.
My whole day today was spent dealing with filterable, super customized drop down lists and was just wondering how our clients would even survive had we provided them with only simple select drop downs. Hence what prompted me to come to good ol reddit to get some thoughts.

Way back when i had discovered the concept of `datalist` and wondered why that hadnt fully replaced `select`s then i learned safari doesnt support them </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In answer to your question, yes.

Interesting experience.. A lot of our clients find it annoying having to scroll through heaps of items in lists and welcomed the idea of having the list filterable. I guess its another case of whatever the customer likes most.. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is it even worth using select elements anymore when text inputs with autocomplete libraries provide so much more functionality? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It seems that it has become standard practice to create "dropdowns" in UI with `input type="text"` and an accompanying JS plugin and datasource instead of plain `select`. The main reason being to overcome the issue of `selects` not having a string matching capability.

If you where creating a web application from ground up in 2016, would you ever consider using `select` over text input with some kind of autocomplete library?

*Edit: clarity </TEXT>
