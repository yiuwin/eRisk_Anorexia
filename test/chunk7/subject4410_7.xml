	<TEXT> OK. Look at my Spurs now. Do you think they could contend with Kawhi? I literally don't have a *single player* over 60 overall, and I would rather draft a guy like Deandre Ayton, and then Sign a guy like KD, and go from there. Plus, I saw someone who had a difficult situation, who would've been good enough to get 20-25 seed in the conference, but lottery in this game is so unreliable, they would've had a tough time building a team with like, idk, Trevon Duval and Lonzo and Buddy. Where would you go from there? Just continued Mediocrity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chill. I am just looking for young player to build around when I sign some studs next year. My team is crap anyway and there is no point in me wasting kawhi's career on a mediocre team. When the Kings told me they were going to try and sign Curry to pair him with Lonzo + Curry I though why not do what is best for Kawhi's career, cuz he is at the end of his prime. </TEXT>
