	<TITLE> [Product question] Substitute for Aztec secret indian clay mask </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-20 18:58:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've just finished my Aztec clay mask and it was expensive to buy it from Europe. I have oily acne prone skin and this mask seems to help me a lot, but I would like to know if any of you know about another clay mask (that comes in powder) instead of this. I have been reading the clay's descriptions and I'm not sure if I should buy a bentonite or another one.

Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do you properly use Albolene as makeup remover? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've just bought a bottle of Albolene to remove my makeup and I think I'm not using it properly because after the double cleansing I apply a toner with a cotton pad and there is still a bit of dirt sometimes. I take a hazelnut size amount and spread it all over my face with my hands, then I rub it, not very hard, and I remove it with some paper. I then use the Calendula cleanser of Kiehl's. Any tip to improve it? Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was surprised. I live in Spain and the shipping costs from US were super high, so I searched in /r/skincareaddictionuk and I found this, it had super good reviews. Is quite simple, and honestly, it smells kind of funny, but I guess every vitamin c does. Still, it hasn't broke me out, which is surprising and I see my phi quite better. I keep it in the fridge and I use it in the morning as I read is not recommended to use it with your acids. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mum (58yo) is experiencing hair loss since the beginning of this year and she's starting to worry a lot about it, so I bought her Rogaine, but in the pharmacy they only had the one for men and I thought it was the same. Now she was going to apply it and she's read that is strictly for men's use, is this true? Can it cause side effects in women?  </TEXT>
