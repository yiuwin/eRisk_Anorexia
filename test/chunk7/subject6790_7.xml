	<TEXT> "Seeing what has rolled out under the current administration, do you think that Scarborough subway plan will actually happen?  

No. If by that you mean, Will it get built?  no. Ive lived the political history of transit in this city for over 25 years. Ive watched, Ive fought for it, Ive learned, Ive listened. Ive seen all of the best planning, Ive had access to all of the best information about how to build transit in this city.

It is impossible to believe, if you have that background, that what will be a $4 billion subway stop will ever get built. What we will see is more studies, and money spent on it, but you wont see it be built. Because some governments going to come to its senses and cancel the project because it makes no economic or transportation sense whatsoever, because it uses up so much of the money.

It prevents the building of the rapid transit that is needed, which is the rapid transit that serves low income communities across this city.

What youre saying, with the Scarborough one stop extension, to low income neighbourhoods is, Stay in the bus. In fact, what youre really saying to people is, get to the back of the bus. Because youre saying, we dont care. We have this money to spend on transit, that we know could make a significant difference to your lives  which is part of the provincial and city strategy to support people in low income neighbourhoods  but we dont care because were going to use the money to build one subway stop.

Its that blunt, that direct, and that clear."

	<TEXT> Yup.  I once had a landlord who was going to move me into another area of her basement since the floor had cracked...
I moved out instead.  I will never do a basement apartment again..

This lovely business owner should be locked up.  I cannot fathom not repairing things.  If it's not repairable unless the unit is vacant (bullshit on that one), then he has to pay for temporary lodging...

	<TEXT> He's a nut.

He squanders that theatre and doesn't repair it, and manages to keep customers away by treating them like garbage...

Wonder if he'll make more from insurance if it can't stay afloat.... </TEXT>

Plus the fact he replies to people who comment with

The Owner really needs to step away from the computer.  He's doing more harm to himself than this whole saga is.

He is going to end up with a movie theatre no one goes to because everyone knows what a jerk he is.  At the end of the day, no amount of special screenings can pay the rent if you have no customers. </TEXT>
