	<TEXT> I'm honestly so disappointed in this game. I was a massive fan of halo wars one only to have halo wars two collect dust on my shelf due to the buggy state. 

I keep coming back here to see if there's been any positive changes but I don't feel like it's getting better..  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's always situational, great thing about RTS. 

My standard start is building two supply pads follows by two power generators. In the meantime I use my two units to collect nearby resources, I upgrade my two generators and build a barracks then decide whether I need to build more marines, build snipers or upgrade my base for tier two units! 

I normally play as forge, helps win against rushes!  </TEXT>

I played halo wars one for all the 8 years it's been out, over 5 times the amount of exp needed for general, and I can't play hw2. 

I've moved onto a beta game ATM which has better connectivity than the PREMIUM game I bought for 70.. </TEXT>

Me and a friend were playing many games last night only to play for 40 minutes and have the game disconnect. Happened more than one and now my win/loss ratio has dramatically changed due to 343i not finishing their game properly again.. 

If it's not resolved soon it's gonna get refunded.  </TEXT>
