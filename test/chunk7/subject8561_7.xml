	<TITLE> [question] big table (250MM recs) small update </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-13 06:59:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've got a table with 250MM records.  A simple 10 record update:

    UPDATE top (10) big table

    SET columnX = 1

Is taking forever.  Clustered index, table locks, I've tried it all and need some ideas about what might be happening

FYI: updating 20MM recs normally takes  lt;1 min for me.


Any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So trust: she is trustworthy *for a politician*.  good politicians are not truly trustworthy. keeping promises detrimental is to success.  Classic examples are ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders - both inflexible purests who I can trust would try what they say...but really won't accomplish anything. 

 Obama got a pass because he had 0 record pre presidency, ended up being pretty good at presidential politics and, coincidentally, not trustworthy (high deportation, no transparency, Syria redline, etc)

The Cruz/Sanders noble cause types have great ideas, and are needed in the national conversation - but are shit at actual hands-in-the-meat-grinder leading.  

I'm much more comfortable with a Hillary/Obama/Romney type waking up, reading the polls and public sentiment Bernie influenced, completely rearranging their platform.  And playing the devil's game make to make happen.

I do think Hillary is best suited to make Congress move.  I don't think they hate her more, they just have more ammunition on her and she is the most threatening to their agenda </TEXT>

Just speculating but:
1.  Maybe it was intended to make their version more sensational for the news, thus better positioned to over shadow the Republican report.

2.  It draws attention to the fact that the line of questioning was about politics, not benghazi

	<TEXT> we'll just overlook that Hillary was coordinating with the DNC, against a *Republican* field

No one is overlooking the fact dems coordinate against republicans.  That's part of their job, not fraud.

At the time, the only way the Republicans would have been her targeted opponents was if the DNC was expected to consider the Democratic primary 'a technicality.' 

What, like she is friends with republicans and is mandated to ignore Benghazi and email attacks until the primaries are over?  That's not fraud, that's politics 101.

And if you notice the race was never really between Hillary and any other Democrats, but instead Hillary vs the Republicans. 

Uh no.  That's a fact.  Look at the ballots if you don't believe me. 

Weird how that worked out.

	<TEXT> No.  I legit had no idea.  I always thought Wales was a region without political consequence.  Like saying Midwest or Pacific coast in the US.
