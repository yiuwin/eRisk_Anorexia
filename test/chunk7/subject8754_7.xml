	<TEXT> For what it's worth. I work for a highway maintenance company here in Houston. They just got the contract for 610 loop and everything inside of it besides 45 and 288 on 1 of September. I also worked for the company that used to have the same contract and they lost it on 31 of May. When we started we were already playing catch up.  Houston gets dirty real fast. We are a relatively small crew of 30. We have 2 liter crews that consist of 14 people. We have something called hands crew that consist of 12 people and a 2 man crew that do signs. The other 2 are the supervisor and the project manager. We are out there trying our best. TxDOT is the one that hands out the contracts and they told us to hit the 610s loop hard for the past 3 weeks. If you drive by there a lot during the day I'm sure you've seen us. We have white trucks with lights similar to cops. Be cautious and be careful. We work hard to keep the streets up to par. And you are most certainly correct the south loop will slowly dwindle back to what it was. The best way to get things done is to call TranStar.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had my Tahoe stolen in 2014. Spotted it in the Galleria area while on the bus. I told the bus driver what was going on so he stopped and let me out. The entire time I'm calling the cops. Called 911 and they told me to call the non-emergency number. The auto theft detective told me I was not priority and there was no cops in the area to assist me. The guy got away and probably didn't even know I seen him. It was paid off only by a month and the adjuster listed it as a Z71 and I got 19k for it. More then I would have got if I were to sell it. Silver linings.  </TEXT>
