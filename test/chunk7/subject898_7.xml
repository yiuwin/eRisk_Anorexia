I used to avoid them since I really am not a fan of horror, but after watching movies like The Guest and Don't Breathe I've realized how different thrillers and horrors are. What are some great thriller movies? Old or new, but I would prefer more recent ones that are good. </TEXT>

I work at a popular toy store (just easier if I don't say which one) and for both the Switch and the Nintendo Classic, we would get maybe 10 a month total, and they just show up without warning. It's ridiculous. I was getting 3 calls a say about the Nintendo classic everyday I've worked since December and still have never personally seen one in stock. Same goes for the switch now, we only got 20 for launch and I've had at least 100 people ask me if we have any. I don't know what the fuck Nintendo is doing but they are basically saying no to money and building hype for a nonexistent product (at least with the classic that was the case)  </TEXT>
