	<TEXT> Well, I wouldn't say that polls reflect the opposite currently. There are a few big indicators that people refuse to recognize. The most accurate poll going back the past 3 elections has Trump in the lead by nearly 3 points, trump rallies have 10's of thousands of people in attendance while Hillary's tend to be very small, and it is also important to remember that Donald Trump secured more GOP primary votes that any in the history of the United States. People who take the time and energy to vote in the primary will most certainly vote in the general election. I live and work in the Silicon Valley so yes my vote for Trump probably wouldn't matter in the grand scheme of things with the electoral college and such but I am still going to get out to the polls and show my support.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're kind of blind when it comes to your reasoning that the other 2 are "disgusted" by Trump. I am a very firm Trump supporter but in the workplace environment Politics isn't the greatest thing to talk about. I know how people shame Trump supporters so the last thing I'm going to do is walk around flamboyantly supporting Trump. There is a silent majority in this country and they are going to come out to the polls in droves. Your assumption is entirely wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look at it this way. Last year as a college TE Hunter Henry didn't drop A SINGLE pass. Although he fumbled last week to lose the game for the chargers, this dude has hands and Philip Rivers trusts him. Last week he ran the second most routes out of any receiver on the field. Hunter 100%.  </TEXT>
