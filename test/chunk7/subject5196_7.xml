	<TEXT> I flew out here for the weekend to just be in Wrigleyville for this amazing moment. So glad they won one of em. I hope they win it all, but for me, tonight, standing next to the Ron Santo statue and watching the Centerfield scoreboard record that last out, hearing the crowd roar, singing Go Cubs Go with everyone around me... It was all worth it. 

I have to go back to LA now, where I will hide out in my local Chicago bar Tuesday night and hope to celebrate with my fellow displaced fans. Through the insanity of this month, I've realized a lot of things, the biggest being that there is an amazing comradery in sports, but the version that surround the Chicago Cubs fan base is just unmatchable in my eyes. 

Thank you Chicago for allowing me to join in the insanity. All this has done is remind me how very much I want to move back home so that being a part of moments like this don't have to require cross country flights :).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This all reminds me of an interview is read once of Stephen Colbert. He wasn't playing the TV character, it was a real interview, and the interviewer asked him if Nixon was REALLY his favorite president, and his response was pretty moving, iirc, and really opened my eyes, for the first time, that there was more to the man than just Watergate. I can't find the article, but I found this quote which might be from it ? 

"I have tender feelings for Nixon, because everybody has warm feelings about their childhood. Actually, I didn't like the Watergate trials 'cause they interrupted The Munsters... Nixon was the last liberal president. He supported women's rights, the environment, ending the draft, youth involvement, and now he's the boogeyman? Kerry couldn't even run on that today." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally fair. My post wasn't meant to be some kind of call out or bash either. I was just agreeing with the idea of not getting it, mainly from not being there and my experiences being exposure to negatives. 

Totally understand the down voting, too, I just wanted to be clear that I am aware I'm coming from a pov of ignorance, so I don't blame anyone for doing so.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But that isn't the point. It's not, 'I'm not going because GSP isn't there' so much as it seems to be, 'I'm not going because this lackluster card didn't end up being the surprise return of GSP, and that's pretty fucked, considering how weak this card is.'  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a newish comer as well, the love for GSP baffles me. I'm content with the knowledge that I wasn't there so I won't get it, and I can respect that but from my perspective, he just seems to be a cheater who got out with his career intact, despite actually "losing" his last fight. 

It's hard to undo first impressions. I've been trying to watch more of his fights and develop more of a respect for him, but so far it just hasn't stuck. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, the article does state that it was the UFC's call.  
"The Arena da Baixadas security team is requesting fans to throw away the mask before they enter the stadium, and told MMA Fighting that the UFC made the call. "

And now that the advert is being pointed out to me, I'm assuming that very likely was the reason and am even sadder.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I find out no Rogan commentary for this, and I'm a little disappointed, but OK.  

Then I lose Silva and Hall.  Really bummed. 

NOW THEY'VE TAKEN THE WERDUM MASK?!  No more! I won't stand for it.  I'll...I'll...OK, look.  I'll do nothing.  But dammit, I was really looking forward to Stipe's walkout tonight :(. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They do. Just go to a Reebok store.  

Or are you referring to the hoodies specifically?  I mean, they make those blank as well: http://www.reebok.com/us/ufc-walkout-hoodie/AO3495.html?cm_mmc=ReebokSEM_PLA-_--_--_--_-dv:eCom cm_mmc1=US utm_source=google utm_medium=cse utm_term=889132901696 gclid=CLWt0puk2swCFciIfgodY9EMfw 

Or (can you see I'm working through this in my head as I write this?) do you mean with no UFC logos on them whatsoever?  There could be some hope on their site there as well: http://www.reebok.com/us/hoodies 

I was at the Reebok store last week and that was the first time I'd seen the fight kits in person.  I liked the material a lot, but not enough to drop the cash on them.  Some of their other training gear was legit very nice, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My life has been a nightmare since deciding he was my favorite fighter.  I made this decision after seeing a replay of 187.  The only fights of his I've seen live have been Mir, Miocic and Overeem.  Not exactly something to keep the hype train running. 

But I'm not fair-weather or anything.  The guy has a great history, great legacy, that's not going away. I just wish I'd've been around to see it.   </TEXT>

A much nicer experience then when I was in an elevator in Kyoto and some guys kept referring to my friend and I as foreigners, thinking we didn't understand them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow...I was honestly really looking forward to this.  I fell really hard for Thomson in his last UFC fight against Ferguson. I know he got pounded, but he had incredible heart, and he made me a fan.  I missed his first two Bellator fights and was *really* looking forward to this one.  

Is this seriously another AKA related situation, too? As someone who's a relatively new fan to the sport, they're seriously killing the vibe for me.  I mean, this is insane, it really is.  How can I get excited for a fight that one of their team is a part of at this point? How?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's all situational though, I feel.  In my opinion, on any given day, Johnson can beat anyone.  But that comes with a caveat: It almost *has* to be in the first round.  I mean, you saw what he did to Cormier.  Yes, Cormier beat him, but not without a legit scare.  I don't think AJ had the right plan for that fight, either. He seemed completely lost when his punch didn't finish the fight. 

Not to make excuses, but Koscheck "beat" him.  That fight disgusts me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Off the top of my head: Stipe vs Arlovski, because the latter is my favorite fighter, and if he won that fight, you'd definitely be looking at him getting a title shot and I was so stupidly hyped about the whole thing.  Yet, pretty aware he was going to lose, so it was some awful nerves/butterflies. 

Holm / Rousey is the other one, because I bought into the last minute hype that Holm would win and I really wanted to see "history" made. </TEXT>
