	<TEXT> I answered another comment with some tips she gave me. She also pointed out specific parts of the movement and how those parts "should" be played, and what techniques should be used. Like the beginning should be staccato only using your fingers but in measure 27-34 you should use your whole hand and the right and left hand should be totally in sync and use the same amount of power (I believe at least she meant).

The melody in 40 and onwards should be totally legato while the constant rhythmic percussion part on D and C should just be accompanying the melody but be VERY precise, rhythmic, have its own life and staccato.

And so on. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, she showed me how to play staccato with VERY little effort when playing fast, and it involves not moving your arms up or down at all, only your fingers. You need to flick the keys so the spring back up. Your fingers should use the keys like a trampoline. Then when you need to accent a note you use your whole hand to press down on that key. 

When doing octave leaps, your pinky and and thumb should probably be hitting the same key after each other. Focus on ONLY your thumb and pinky and practice just hitting the one and single "common" key with those. The rest of the octaves should just come easy.

Similarly when playing melodies in octaves. Practise ONLY using your thumb. Your pinky will almost automatically play correctly anyway. (This is for both hands.) 
(you can actually try to place your (right) hand on top of the e.g. C3 and C4 and try to hit C3 whit your thumb while keeping your pinky absolutely still. It's impossible. YAY free key strikes wop wop!)

	<TEXT> I practise different amounts different days, but actually focused practise on a technically advancing piece often almost only always happen on Mondays and weekends. It depends on what I have to do in school (studying music). Right now, I'm practising Ginastera's 1'st piano sonata 4'th movement. Tomorrow I'm attending a masterclass with Valentina Lisitsa. 
However
I'm sick today, so I'm staying home (more time for practise :D) to be sure to be able to attend tomorrow (I actually did't get an active place on the masterclass but I will be there and listen). Tomorrow I'm also in a accompaniment-band for one of my schools song-ensembles High School Musical performance! :3

When I practice, I start with reading and learning the whole song so I know it without sheet music. Then I practise every part VERY slow and make part by part perfect. Then I piece them together and make my overall performance perfect! :)

Edit: spelling and: I usually play between one and four hours a day. 

Edit2: My teacher got back to me and now I'm going not only to listen to Valentina but play for her as well! :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do not agree with this at all.
I think the entire first half of the movie is a deliberate stylistic way of making the viewer expect a traditional Hollywood dramaturgy and a happy go lucky story where everything is magically awesome in the end. How Mias and Sebastians relationship started in the movie is only a kind of metaphor. It's totally unrealistic what happened in the beginning of the movie, it's the La La Land, the magical movie-world where everything is perfect. Sometimes reality kicks in and letdowns happen however. (What I mean is that how Mia and Sebastian fell in love with each other actually didn't happen the way we saw in the movie, but it really doesn't matter. What matters is that they ended up together and in love, how it happened is not as important. What we saw in the beginning of the movie could perhaps be their memory of how it happened, much rosier than real life.)
In the second half of the movie, reality is much more present and the La La Land only shows it self in sprinkles here and there. 
What then happens in the ending is basically a recap of how the story would have been if it all took place in La La Land, but then in the final scene, we are back to reality. Mia and Sebastian maybe still had feelings for each other, but they both knew it would be too complicated and harmfull to try and explore those feelings. Mias husband is not a bad man, they probably love each other too. Life is complicated, not black and white. It's not simply win or loss, good or bad, but a complicated mix of everything. The smile in the end is a bittersweet reminding of that.
You can't get everything.

	<TEXT> Nowadays, I mostly break down non-functional fusion music and try to figure out what kinds of composition techniques they have used and then incorporate the tonality in to my improvisation. This means I focus on the harmony and the changes, not so much the form or rhythm.

	<TEXT> Yes of course, but just practising recognising the feeling of being relaxed is important! As you say, you are more tense when using many fingers, so like my teacher sais, it would be wonderful if you only could use one finger, because then you don't tend to tense up as much!
Practising knowing how to feel when playing makes you relise faster when later practising a tune on when you are too tense and how you should avoid it! :)
Personally, I haven't done much one finger practise, so t may not be very effective, I've more heard about it than tried it :)

	<TEXT> But learning how to relax your hands and arms while playing is really important, especially when playing faster pieces, and practising playing songs with only one finger, is really good for this. My piano teacher has said multiple times that if you could play any tune with one single dinger, that would be the best, but most tunes have more than one tone at once as well as legato lines, so one can only dream.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello!
I listened to some your linked tunes!
I think what you need is some courses in music theory and specifically instrumentation. You've gotten a good start, but your scoring could use some improving!
Likewise, the electronic stuff is certainly interesting, but could use some mixing. 
Hope it goes well for you in the future and good luck!

	<TEXT> Practise so slow that you never hit a wrong key in tempo, master that and gradually very slowly increase the tempo.
