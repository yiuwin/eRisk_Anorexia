	<TITLE> Question about replacement parts. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I've owned a 2009 Honda Civic EX for the past year. During this time I discovered that one of the wheels is warped and needs to be replaced. I have checked with my local Honda dealer for an estimate on a wheel and installation and they quoted me at $400 which is steep. I also checked out places like partsgeek.com and found them for $130. So my question is, is there any difference in the quality of the wheels from each place? What about any other parts online as opposed to going to a dealer? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I heard about the 5 minute journal and read about it a little bit, and a few weeks ago began doing that. Some days I feel like I have something to put down but most I don't. Does it get any easier to write with time? I feel like I'm trying to pull things out of me so that I have something to write, but maybe it would be better if it were left alone. Thoughts? </TEXT>
