	<TEXT> Masasabi nyo bang nawawalan na sayo ng interes yung tao just through chat? Like pag bago palang kayong friends sa FB puno pa ng emojis, "hahahaha"s, greetings every before and after matulog, etc. then pag tumagal nawawala na yung mga yan at ikaw na dapat yung mag initiate just to see them do that as well. Parang pinipilit mo nalang sila :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well not exactly impossible but what songs do you think are difficult to perform live? It's "Decks Dark" for me. I've seen live videos of it but it's not as good as the studio version. I guess they really need to bring in the orchestra and choir to capture the song's beauty. </TEXT>
