	<TEXT> Back story: 
I've been dry for like a week and with that comes the natural longing for or dear and merciful friend, Mary Jane. 

Real story: 
Last night I went to sleep with a terrible migraine, wishing I could be saved by the sweet fumes of our holy vegetation. Alas, I was still as dry as a senior citizens Vagina, in the desert, during a drought. 
I laid in bed tossing and turning until I drifted to an uneasy sleep. Unexpectedly, I was met in my dream world by the most loyal of companions, who were working diligently to fashion a stupendously gorgeous blunt. 
We then continued the proceedings with the ceremonious lighting of torches and floated weightlessly to the land of stone in the sky. 

TL;DR:
I got high in a dream without being high irl. 
Weird right? 
Let me know if it has happened to you  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea even if it's a hard drug, you're talking the person out of one bad situation and putting them in a worse one. 
They're going to leave prison angry at the cops and the world and start the cycle all over again (at least 7 times out of 10) 
If they put the people in a rehab facility to help them with their addictions instead of imprisoning them and doing NOTHING to fix the problem at least some of them Would come out better and stronger for it and maybe make something of themselves. 
I thought we would have figured out by now that just like little kids, a timeout doesn't fucking phase them. 
A murderer is still a murderer. A thief is still a thief. 
The government thinks that putting them in a hole (which gains certain gang members respect) for a while will somehow change what they do when they get out. 
I'm not blaming the police though, it's the governments fault. 
Do I like the police? Nah man, I smoke weed hahaha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was browsing reddit when I found a post from a guy with a picture of his uncle taking a selfie in 1971. I clicked on the post and the image that came up freaked me out sooooo much.
It was my face. Not just someone who looks a lot like me but EXACTLY like me. So much alike that I sent the picture to my mom and she sent back "wow that's a really great 70's costume, but how did you edit the photo to look old like that?" 

Here is a picture of me and a pic of the guy:

http://imgur.com/a/4zxE1

I tried to contact the OP but he never replied. 
This led me to believe that I traveled back to the 70's and got stuck there. Future me posted the picture on Reddit, knowing that I'm on here all the time and is trying to make contact. 

I guess I could also be high hahaha

	<TEXT> I'm assuming your desire drops off after an hour for two reasons: your fingers start to hurt and you're tired of playing/practicing the same things over and over

After you've been playing for a while both of these problems will be solved, mostly haha 

Your fingers won't hurt as much because you will have built up callouses and you will have more finger strength (also helps out if you've got a lady friend of you catch my drift) and you will realize that you don't need to press down on the strings near as hard to fret a note(the sooner you figure that one out the better). 
You won't be bored of playing the same things because you will have learned much more and you can start to write your own music, or interpret your favorite music in your own way(I love doing this because it helps you not only to understand song structure and the songwriting process in general, but it also helps you find your own style). 
Until then, listen to as many different genres of music as you can, fill your head with subliminal music ideas for later when you are writing or doodling(remember that learning to play any form of music is just as much about LISTENING as it is about playing). 
Hope I helped!  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I'm a guitar player and I'm starting to scratch the surface of theory. I am doing pretty well with it so far, but a few things still trip me up. 
Anyways I made this progression the other day and I can't decide what key it is in.... 
The chords are: 
Dm7/A, Am, B flatmaj7, C 
Then I walk the bass notes back to the A to start over. 
I'm torn between Dm and Am... Which is it? Could it be either depending on what notes I choose to play over the progression?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Say anything has a lot of great stuff that translates well on an acoustic, and a good amount of acoustic songs as well! 
All of their songs are fairly easy to sing along with and have great meaningful lyrics. 
His playing style uses a lot of inversions that use 2-3 finger groupings. 
I would suggest "Alive With the Glory of Love", "Total Revenge", and "I Want to Know Your Plans". 

Some that I'm not sure wether or not they use primarily 3 fingers, but are still great songs, are "Death for My Birthday", "Eloise", "The Futile", "Do Better", "Yellow Cat/Red Cat", and "Hate Everyone". 

The most difficult part of his playing style is his right hand rhythm technique so maybe with your fretting hand injured it could be a great opportunity to put some work in on your right hand. 

He also has a few simple but satisfying solos in their songs as well. Hope I helped!  </TEXT>

I completely agree. I couldn't put my finger on what it was until you said it but now that you did that is exactly what is making the song lay flat. 
Maybe if I turn the phaser on for the second part of the riff or on the new part I am writing...

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> These are the main riffs of the song that I want to build off of.

https://soundcloud.com/mosaicthemortal/lips-stitched-silent

I want to add more on top of this but I don't want it to sound too busy. I'm using a few effects, but most importantly delay, set at 1/2 bar and about 12 o'clock on the mix. 
Any advice as far as how the song flows or what I can do to add more without sounding to busy? 
Also if any of you could recommend any artists who have a similar sound that i could listen to, that would be much appreciated. I used to play Americana folkish type stuff as you can tell from my other songs but I've really been trying to improve my guitar skills lately, and I've kinda headed in this direction, the problem is, I'm not really certain what genre it is... Haha 
Thanks for listening!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just use your voice, but bring it up to its highest potential. 
Look at all of the terrible singers out there who made it super big because they owned it and played to their advantage. 
Jack white-uses crazy voice as a positive not a drawback 
Max bemis- basically talk sings/ yells, but it works 
Find what makes your voice special and make that excel </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah it doesn't match the flow right 
I agree that whole songs lyrics are idiotic and unimportant, but the thing that makes that song genius is how the syllables flow together making a unique rhythm 
You can change the words all you want but make sure it fits the flow  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It actually shows that the person playing him is black on IMDb 
I think it's iris's brother like the new reverse flash in the new 52 lineup 
They just introduced the fact that iris had a brother she didn't know about, so it would make sense logistically if you look at how the show has introduced new villains so far 
Most like likely iris's brother from earth 2 </TEXT>
