	<TITLE> Issues I have with story writing in all three games. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-26 12:41:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before you jump on me, let me say that I really loved the initial plot of the first two games and the setting. I liked the whole Noosphere thing and the C-Conscience twist to it. I was on board with Clear Sky unknowingly doing what they wanted to do.

But the journey of characters is just not there, your and many other characters are static bricks just not evolving or changing anything. 

The moment when I noticed what is wrong with the Stalker stories is when I was going on my 2nd playthrough of the Clear Sky. I was about to talk to Beanpolev, when I realized, what's the point? 

All he is gonna do like most of the characters in Stalker is, just spout exposition and some more exposition. Then I noticed how little of dialogues and conversations interested me on my 2nd and 3d playthroughs of all games. Because I knew they are irrelevant to my enjoyment of the game and that some of them lead to nothing.

Honestly, I couldn't have cared less about the endings in CoP(I'll get back to CoP), they all just seemed irrelevant to me, because I didn't establish connection with any character in the game really. Why? Because again they are bare bones, you barely interact with them on any interesting deeper level and your own character is no character. 

When played ShoC for the first time and encountered the factions in the beginning, I was so amazed at the DutyVsFreedom concept, but as the game(s) progressed, that again I couldn't care any less, since they barely have any quests  and characters to speak off.


They were interesting concepts to think about and discuss but they didn't have any story telling value.

Then there is CoP... You start out really interesting and then... Yeah, finding out why some choppers went down wasn't really all that interesting nor were the characters you met during that (except the crazy guy). Then even Strelok shows up! To do nothing really. Nothing about Monolith is resolved or the Zone. How can they exist anymore, the Zone should at least have no emissions, less zombies and no freakin' Monolith. But those are plot holes, the plot itself is too boring anyway. 

Now yes I know, Stalker is a lot about the atmosphere and immersion, and being gripped by the world not by the conventional plot. But so are Dark Souls games, but yet the have so many emotional character moments and memorable lines, although dialogue is far more scarce in them.

You can see it in the community too, what is popular is are memes, concepts, gameplay mechanics-elements. But characters, hardly.

Out of the three protagonist, Strelok is the only one that has some "fundamentals" and the only one that I would call interesting.  But even he falls into the FPS cliche of "Silent badass protagonist" that was popular for so long. In essence, to me he is less developed than some CoD protagonists. I won't even comment on the other two Stalker protagonists.

If we ever get a sequel, I hope this changes, at least for the side characters. I get that the silent protagonist is a strong cliche but there are so many other FPS games with the SP but they at least have memorable and interesting side characters, and some of them even have honest to God character journeys and development. Metro, Stalker's younger cooler brother has that.

	<TEXT> Unless they are carrying specifically NVGs, I just can't shrug it off. But the worst thing about this is that its not Misery's flaw per say, I have encountered this in every Stalker game/mod. The devs just didn't bother with stealht and made an half-assed broken mechanic. 

As far as I understand, AI gets no penalty from dark and there are no "polygons" in vegetation that prevents them seeing you. Also the second one bandit see's you, all of them are instantly aware of your coordinates. In most of stealth games, there some kind of progression, like from somebody kinda thinking something is wrong, to hey this is an enemy, to hey EVERYBODY this is an enemy and he is there.  </TEXT>

Nope sorry, I disagree on that, again at least, the very least you need these "fix" mods, that iron out the game. They just have way to many technical flaws, CS especially is a shit show without mods, I would never even bother with it, if it weren't not for mods.

	<TITLE> Misery tweaks sub-mods, what do you change or add and why? Help the newbies out. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-25 17:12:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I want to play the current Misery, but it has a "divisive" reputation, and even without that, it has a lot of add ons, sub-mods, tweaks etc... 

Let me explain first where and I believe other people come from. I want challenge and immersion. I do not want punishment and sadism. I love the Stalker games and I love Dark Souls games, I also like a lot of stealth games, fps games etc... I always liked something that is difficult but when achieved feels rewarding and fulfilling. I also like it when there are consistent and clear laws in a game world, it makes it feel more alive, it draws you in. I hope most of you understand this, because some people just don't get it. I have seen people react in a very juvenile way when they are faced with legitimate criticism of Misery. They behave like "Whatever casual, go and play CoD". or they just play dumb and say "Ah its fun because its realistic" but refuse to go down in specifics.. I hope we won't have none of that.

If you see me make a wrong assumption about Misery, please feel free to correct them with the actual truth. However please don't just leave vague posts as "Misery is amazing/horrible you should(not) play it". Please be specific about why do you think what you think.

I would like to help me and other newcomers to tweak Misery, or rather how and why to change some aspects of the mod. Keep in mind I am talking about classic Misery, not CoM.

Now the imperative for me and for a lot of people not sure about Misery seems to be consistency and immersion. That means that the enemies like you have to uphold the same "laws" of "realism", assuming you are carrying the same equipment or in the case of mutants some common sense and our understatement of animals must be kept in mind. Also the basic, most fundamental lore of Stalker franchise must be there, I will explain all of it.

I and seemingly other people would like to tweak Misery in a following way:

- Human enemies have plausible aim, what that means is that an expert merc and a rookie bandit cannot have the same aim skills or equipment. What that means is that low tier enemies with shitty low caliber weapons shouldn't be able to wast you in pitch dark over 500m away. Nor should they be bullet sponges. A bullet in the head should kill anyone without adequate protection, a few bullets(depending on the caliber) to the body. Same goes for the player.

- Mutants, well they are weird but basically most of them too should just drop dead if hit by a full shotgun blast in the head or a high caliber weapon. Boars for example could survive this, since we know they have thick skin and skull in real life and are notorious for being hard to kill. But a fucking dog or even a Bloodsucker? The lore just doesn't give us any reason to think they will have some epic sturdy heads, that can withstand an RPG.

- Artifacts, from what I hear they are useless and too cheap to sell. Which is quite frankly baffling, since they are the foundation of the entire Stalker lore. Artifacts should absolutely always, have to be expensive. If you want to make them difficult to acquire, fine, but make it worth IT! If they are not worth it, the entire premise collapses. 

- Economy, from what I hear its not even that bad, but just in case, I would like it to be fair, and not "fuck you". 
 
- This one is kinda personal, very personal and I hold no grudges if you or the mod creators think otherwise. I want all the emissions, blow out or whatever, gone. I just do not want it in my game, I do not want to sit and stare in the screen doing nothing. To me its a complete waste of my precious time and seems like pure frustration without any interesting catch to it. 

For the love of God, if you know how to turn Emissions of, please tell me!

A new addition:

- Grenade(spam), a lot of people hate how NPCs can just chuck a grenade after a grenade, with perfect absolute precision.

Now here are some sub-mods and add-ons that draw my and the communities attention. I would like to know can they be combined or additionally tweaked.

- [The Armed Zone](http://www.moddb.com/mods/misery-the-armed-zone)

Immediately, what seems to be biggest sub-mod for Misery is the biggest confusion to me, that is, if you want to add more sub-mods, on its own, it seems like an absolute must have for Misery, and it seems relatively easy to add. The problem comes from, that there is so many other weapon sub-mods, so I am not quite sure can they fit or no. Also the other sub-mods, I wonder can they fit, especially the ones that alter balance.

I see people even mentioning Arsenal as a viable combo.

- [Original Guns Reanimated](http://www.moddb.com/mods/original-guns-reanimated/downloads/misery-211-compatibility-patch)

This one seems innocent enough, but does it go together with TAZ?

- [Vancer2's All Weapons upgrades](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-misery/forum/thread/vancer2s-all-weapons-upgrades)

I think this is an add-on for an add-on, it supposed to add more weapons for the previously mentioned TAZ. I cannot say anything more on this though. Seems like a must have.

- [Spawn Dialog 1.1c.1 for Misery 2.1.1 w/ TAZ v1.7.4](http://www.moddb.com/mods/misery-the-armed-zone/addons/spawn-dialog-11c-for-misery-211-w-taz-v174)

I have no idea what this does, as I am not a Misery player, but it should be good, seeing as it has nothing to do with balance.

- [Yasti's Gameplay Tweak Compendium](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-misery/forum/thread/yastis-gameplay-tweak-compendium#thread)

This one is outdated, but I think the OP has still useful advice on how to tweak some things. If you have used advice from here feel free to post it.

- [Weapons and ammo mod for misery 2.1](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-misery/forum/thread/weapons-and-ammo-mod-for-misery-21)

OP is too vague and lacks info, so I am not sure what does this do.

- [Stiivais' misc tweaks.](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-misery/forum/thread/misery-21-stiivais-misc-tweaks)

Same goes as for Yasti's. Some tweaks might still be possible even though this post is outdated. Though they might be even already in Misery.

- [Stiivais' new performance texture pack and radio songs addon.](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-misery/forum/thread/misery-21-stiivais-new-performance-texture-pack-and-radio-songs-addon)

Misery apparently has really bad performance because of unnecessary intense textures that make no difference to you, this should help apparently. 

- [Anabiotic Fix](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-misery/forum/thread/misery-21-anabiotic-fix)

Hopefully, obsolete and irrelevant, but just in case I will leave it here.

- [Artifact price and weight adjustment](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-misery/forum/thread/misery-21-artifact-price-and-weight-adjustment)

I like this, but its old, so again if its not implemented in the current Misery, I would like to tweak it.

- [Les Miserables](http://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-misery/forum/thread/les-miserables) 

Honestly this one seems like a dream come true, for the most part the changes are what people are hating in Misery, if this is compatible with TAZ, I am good to go. However if someone would like to do some additional tweaking, would it be hard? Most of it seems just digging up some files and mildly changing numbers values.


- [Enhanced Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/2zgfa0/misery_211_enhanced_edition/)

Made by our fellow reditor, this one seems really good.

I kind of recall people mentioning some armor mods that go with Misery, but I am not sure which ones. 

If you know some other cool sub-mods, add-ons and tweaks, don't be shy to share them.

EDIT: I started Misery and immediately I get pissed off. If this is our author's idea of realism and immersion, he must have the weakest human body strengthen, ever. Cause you see, our character cannot carry a knife and a pistol on his side! I have to choose between my pistol or knife as an sidearm! Are you fucking kidding me?!

EDIT2: Immediately, just at the first quest, I get hit by an emission in the worst place, just confirming to me how horribly stupid concept they are, I mean I have to wonder, if they weren't in the vanilla, would Misery even have them? They are stupid, there is just no way around it, I cannot remember any, ANY game where you have to stop what you are doing and then do nothing for minutes, like its a glorified loading screen. 

Oh and guess what, I got shot through a metal wall! I started fighting these NPC stalkers that have these high grade armor which means they should have supplies right? But when you kill them you get scraps... What? One of them, I know has a mp5, but if kill him before he unholsters it, it disappears. Then the eternal paradox of Stalker realism bullshit but amped up, the enemy has an infinite source of ammo but you get like 3 bullets when you loot them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I am soon about to do this really interesting mission, which seems to have many variables, so I can't resist for asking some guidelines.

- What NPCs can I take? I know that I can ask Vano and that soldier at the scientist station, and of course Zulu will come along.

- Do I have to buy SEVA suits for all of them, or some other suit?

- Do they carry their own equipment, can I change it, if so, how?

EDIT: Dang, I can't recruit Strider since I got the "Man Of Balance" achievement, which means Duty/Freedom doesn't "trust me".
EDIT2: But I donated 100k RU, so now I can. I'm not sure is this a mod feature, the mod is called "CoP:Special Edition".

EDIT3: Okay it goes like this, Strider won't accept SVD/Us, but he will accept a Vintorez. Sokolov will accept an Abakan, Vano will take pretty much anything except other shotguns.

You just need to get really close to them and drop them, they will disperse in the air. However they will not use those weapons all the time, sometimes they will switch back to their old ones (I did make sure to drop them weapons with full magazines and I dropped ammo but they wouldn't take it). Strider pretty much used the Vintorez in the beginning and never bothered using it again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I apologize for the excessive length, but it just kinda came to me naturally...

- I was exploring something in the zone, when I entered a small rigid structure, made entirely of concrete and with a few windows, a  military outpost of sorts above some kind of tunnel, in there I saw a room full of military inventory like brand new AKs, Makarovs and most importantly RPGs. "Sweet loot" I think to myself "Will buy much vodka". However the room is locked, but yours truely puts two and two together and gets five, since yours truly likes vodka. 

Anyway, I go back to that tunnel I saw previously, and start exploring, I encounter those little rat thingies and exterminate them, I drag myself across tight corridors with anomalies, and finally I seem to be directly bellow that room, just to find a another opening and... Cyka, a fucking burer a telekinetic mutant asshole is down here and making it really difficult. I give up on my strategy of trying to shoot him down from a distance and using cover, because that is not the way of a Slav, so I proceed to put my shotgun in his face. Worked out pretty well I must say.

Then finally I climb into the room, first I empty up my own loot of old but still weapons I took from zombies, and then I try to take what I can from the military stash. Happily grinning I proceed to leave this outpost, when at the door a black uniform and suspicious disapproving eyes meet me. 

Fucking Duty prick, and he obviously smelled something is cooking. He proceeds to slowly move towards the room where I just left my loot with the left overs from the army, it would still be a big sum and help me a lot. In panic I think of wasting him, and be done with it, but I look around is there any buddies of his, and yes there is... 

The commander approaches looking even the bigger prick, but another idea comes across my mind! HUH! Take that people telling me vodka hurts my brain. I rush to the commander who is waiting in front of the outpost, my idea being if he has any dough, to sell as much as I can and then rush back and take as much as loot as I can.

I start trading with him, when a very familiar sound of breathing starts to feel like its closer and closer. The commander like me senses something is wrong and prepares his shooter. 

The bloodsucker lunges on the most isolated soldier, cunningly being between him and me and the commander, after that we frantically start shooting at air, a duo of Groza and Spas. This time the beast dares to attack both of us, and the bastard still makes it through. 

At this point I am starting to get worried, my health is dripping, the commander might be hurt and the other soldier is probably even more hurt. I see the soldier slowly moving towards the outpost I was just in, probably to have cover on his back. 

Again the breathing, and the mutant leaps on the commander, but this time he was in for a ride, you see the first soldier, that prick that was about to raid my fucking stash, starts shooting from a perfect angle in the safety of the outpost, combined with the second soldier, myself and the commander, the fiend is frightened and retreats in panic, the commander rushes to cover too and I see him slowly adjust his grenade launcher... 

I use the opportunity to heal myself up and reload to shotgun, the air feels heavy, to us heavier than it would have during 86' accident.But slowly we start relaxing and realize it was our day. 

I menage to sell some of the best loot for a good price to the commander and offer him some dough and a drink in return for an escort to Yanov. Turns out they were quite the interesting fellas and they escorted me on towards my new raid, the Jupiter factory... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I think the linearity neuters the atmosphere, because it feels like your on a thrill ride, while in Stalker you can take your time and go wherever you want or "need to". 

Metro games are great, but linearity makes it feel like a gimmick, like somebody is taking you to an exposition of their favorite art and you have to come along.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> CoP mods are a mess, help me and other players understand. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-23 03:08:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I come after finishing SoC and CS at least two times, with two mods each. I've gotta say I am a bit disappointed and confused with the selection on MOD DB. By the way, can you suggest any other source of quality, finished mods for the Stalker games? Even if the website is in Russian, I think I can pull through. Of course, as long as I can download them conveniently.  Of course if you have some other mods to add missed by this list, by all means do it, just give me some summary.

Anyway, I think this thread could be of some help to new people coming to CoP and not just me, there is to many "recommend me modzzzz" threads, and most of them are basically Call Of Chernobyl, Misery and Complete CoP. Well I am not interested in two out of those three, and personally I don't think one should start wtih CoC, without trying out the classic gameplay first. So let's go and take a look at my search in the MOD DB page.

- "Misery+The Armed Zone" So starting off, we have Misery and The Armed Zone , there seems to be a way to combine them, though I am not sure how. Also TAZ is about adding weapons and improving gunplay right? 
Also both teams seem to suggest, that we should wait for the 2.2 ver. of Misery. I think. Misery seems to have a "divisive" effect on the community. Some people say its marvelous immersion, some say its creator is to juvenile and simpleton and some say it used to be good but not now. Well, I can tell you one thing, I do not find mutants that take 10 shotgun shots in the head to be "fun" or immersive, even more so for humans. I also do not find it immersive or fun if some bandit scum can  spot you, hit you and kill you over 100m with some pathetic smg in pitch dark, while you were wearing top of the line armor. That is not realistic, immersive or fun. So those are my two cents, I hope Misery is not like that or if it is, that it can be tweaked or that its visuals can be imported.
EDIT: Is it true that in the latest ver. of Misery you have to throw bolts constantly, because anomalies are invisible and your detector doesn't peep when around them? 

- "Stalker HD Project" Does it only improve textures? If so, can it be combined with other mods?

- "Remake 2.0 Beta." This one seems okay I guess, but I am not sure how is it running, is it buggy, how much does it stray from vanilla (I'm fine with either)

- "Call of Pripyat Anniversary Dead Souls" The MOD DB page is a mess, I think the mod is some kind of compilation, but I have no idea how does it run or how much does it change. 

- "Chernobyl Chronicles " I have no idea what its supposed to do.

- "Merge mod" Well, this one is a bit confusing, he has two mods released in 2015, one of them considerably bigger and it was released earlier. I am not sure are they supposed to be combined or played individually.

- "Real stalkers + Spetsnaz" Seems to be another combination, but I am not sure what is making it stand out.

-  "FERR-UM MOD " Again, I have no clear idea what is this, seems to have some kind of relation to the Spetsnaz mod I mentioned prevously.

- Winter of Death - I have no idea what it does.

- "Call of Pripyat: Special Edition" and "Realism Mod" seem like the only mods that got their shit together. By that I mean, they explain really well what they are about, how do you get them and with what else they work. They seem to be "stable" and like they are late in their development, so no beta. For now, they are my top choices.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Suicide Squad, Rogue One, Fantastic Four, World War Z... 

These are the most famous examples of studio meddling or "fixing" a movie, that basically means that there is a probably a finished movie just lying somewhere gathering dust. 

I'm not claiming the original versions would be better, but just for curiosity sake I would watch them and a descent amount of people. More importantly the studios would make money without having to do anything really.

Now personally I think Fantastic 4 and Suicide Squad would actually benefit more from this, I just can't shake off the feeling their original ver. are more consistent with tone, writing, directing and better paced. So why not do this, there is no losing party here. 

You know if there is something that pisses me off, its when the soulless money hungry corporations do not want my money! Again, these movies are apparently finished or maybe need a little fine tuning in editing, so c'mon there is no way the costs would outweigh the profit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I heard horror stories about CS, but this... 

I honestly doubt this is Yocto's doing, since whatever I do in the options, and I MEAN whatever, the fps stays the same and on their MOD DB page nobody is complaining about that. 

When I zoom my weapon or look at the floor it gets dramatically better. 

Limansk was a dire foreshadowing, there when I looked at certain buildings the frame rate tanked, why? I have no idea, I just don't get it. There was nothing special about those buildings. 

Most of the game the frame rate was in 30-60 territory, and here's my relevant info:
AMD FX 8320 Eight Core Processor
SAPPHIRE DUAL-X R9 280 3GB
8 GB RAM
W8.1 Pro 64-bit
1366x768 Resolution

	<DATE> 2017-04-20 14:05:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For some reason the mods decided to a) leave the incredibly dumb invincibility/invisibility b) raise the health of the bloodsucker to some impossible levels

For reference sake, I am playing the mission where I have to signal the mercenaries and kill the bloodsucker under the tower. Its impossible, why? Because I already stumbled upon one before that, and I emptied around 150 rounds of that AK AP ammo and around 50 of standard ammo with my upgraded Abakan. You think that's bullshit? Wait there's more.

I lured the bloodsucker to the place where the 5 mercenaries are, which means they unloaded on him too, God knows how much, and still I wasted most of my ammo, I wasted a lot of bandage s/medkits and one of the mercenaries died.

Now I have to kill the bloodsucker, with less ammo, and one mercenary less. I did find around 100 NATO AP ammo for a SIG SG 550 and a Dragunov SVU with 15 rounds. None of them were enough + 4 mercenaries, the bloodsucker just jugged it up and killed us all. 

This is the part where the mods and the DEVS lose me, I just can't stop but wonder, do they even play the game? Do they even bother seeing how the results turn out? The bloodsucker is essentially immune to accurate weapons, grenades, grenade launchers, rpgs. You can't use those weapons close quarters, you're only hope are weapons with an INSANE DPS, a DPS that's stupid high...

This is why I miss the Bethesda style console in Stalker games. If the game is being shity because of bugs or one stupid decision by an edgy mod, well I should be able to remedy that with cheats. 

So is there any way to edit them and make it save game compatible?

EDIT: So far by far the most effective and least nerve wrecking way to kill them is simple really. Knife em'. Yeah really, just stand in front of them, press the medkit shortcut accordingly and spam the right click. It kills them in a few stabs. Even better if there are allies nearby.  </TEXT>

At first I thought this might be a bug in the mod(Yoctosphera), but all these three quest have no map direction and have very vague direction, worst being the Duty quest. 

I just have no idea what to do, should search every nook and cranny in Garbage to find Sidorovich's instrument and talk to every Duty npc. I went to the Dark Valley-Garbage passages and haven't found the pda Otter told me to take. 

Then the upgrade quests, seriously, I just have no idea where even to start with them, only a few times I kind of stumble upon some upgrades. The Duty trader sold me info on a upgrade, but I cannot find which stash is that supposed to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I see on MOD DB, CS has by far the weakest mod selection, but I was wondering, could I combine some of these mods? Personally, I would like some immersive graphical overhaul + arsenal + Sky reclamation project.

Have you done this before, if please share the ins and outs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well its the late game with Monolith that drove me to post this, or rather it with the Freedom encounter. 

When you fight Monolith on the way to the Brain Scorcher there is usually one or two covers, and it makes it impossible to be dynamic in combat. Not only that, but if you hide behind a car or truck, the AI is so accurate that it will exploit the tiniest holes, even the ones I cannot simply perceive. 

So I get what you're saying, I am usually trying to have such a play style, though even when I kill an opponent with a silencer the NPCs are instantly aware where I am. At least on the first shoot. 

But as I mentioned in the OP, the grenade spam is absurd, I mean I get 4 grenade prompts when I fight 3-5 guys, and all of them with just unbelievable precision! Like they almost throw them in my lap. 

Then the shrapnel, for god's sake, no matter how much cover, no matter how much distance no matter the artifacts, no matter the 12kg armor, my character is hit by shrapnel and starts bleeding... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So A.I. grenade spam, is it prevalent in SoC mods? Can it be fixed? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am playing RadioPhobia, and again I am considering quiting it or finding somekind of fix, because of the AI grenades. As if the NPC AI wasn't annoying enough (broken stealth, omniawareness, pinpoint accuracy at all times with all weapons), now they can throw a grenade to my exact position give-take a meter or two. 

Now I accepted that kill the Freedom sniper mission, and I climbed the ludicrously high tower where the sniper is. And unbelievably, the AI always throws the grenade at the EXACT top of the tower! They rarely if ever miss it. 

That's just preposterous,  and it really confirmed some of my fears about the stalker modding community and its hypocrisy when it comes to what they call "realism". 

Now when you install Aurora, you get the option to not have AI throw grenades, I didn't choose and I didn't regret it, because the AI didn't spam or was crazy accurate, but it does make me wonder, can you turn of the grenade throwing and is it save game compatible? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel you. Dead City was a nightmare...

The armor disappears or appears, or it appears later or it appears after you load a save or something like that happens to another time.

Sometimes the mod CTDs when I save or quick save, or load some corrupted saves. 

Then there are some "juvenile" creative decisions. But damn the visuals and the sound, goddamn they are good. I really wish another mod would have them, at least the sound. The weapons sound so good.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Radio Phobia and how exactly to install it. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I searched and searched RP's Mod Db page but I couldn't figure this out. 

The mod has 5 files on its MOD DB page (sorted by date of release):

- [RadioPhobia] Dead Nature

- [RadioPhobia] RMA RC1

- [RadioPhobia] RMA RC1a Patch

- [RadioPhobia] RMA RC1b Patch

- [RadioPhobia] RMA Hotfix 2

What confuses me is the first file " Dead Nature", I mean when am I supposed to copy it? After I finish all these, first, or after the RMA RC1 ? If its supposed to be installed last or after RMA RC1, why was it uploaded first?

EDIT1: I think I figured it out. 

It goes like this :

 1. [RadioPhobia] RMA RC1

 2. [RadioPhobia] Dead Nature

 3. [RadioPhobia] RMA RC1a Patch

 4. [RadioPhobia] RMA RC1b Patch

 5. [RadioPhobia] RMA Hotfix 2 </TEXT>
