	<TEXT> Our high school English teacher played parts of this episode as we read Lord of the Flies. Essentially, many critics hated the ending of Lord of the Flies because the story ends with the children being rescued by a passing ship that saw the forest fire they set to kill the main character. It's one of those Dues Ex Machina endings that conveniently wrap everything up and dismiss the reality of what was happening on the island for the sake of closure.  
So when the narrator says "they were rescued by let's say...Moe?", they are poking fun at a Dues Ex Machina ending of their own in which some random character appears and brings them back to civilization.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's honestly a fantastic album.   
If you were around at the time it was a major change in direction from what they had been doing and what they were competing  against.   
Ok Computer came out in 1997. A year that also gave us "Mmm Bop", "Tubthumping" and "I Believe I can fly". The Spice Girls were on the top of their game and the music scene was producing some of the most vanilla tunes they could come up with. Natalie Umbriglia's "Torn", The Cardigans "Love Fool".   google a list of top songs in the UK during 1997 and it's basically the ultimate 90's playlist, everything you associate with the 90's sound and style...  
And then Ok Computer came along and songs like Paranoid Android were actually played on the radio and the video was on MTV and it was unlike anything else around it.   
Maybe it was just the timing of it that makes me have such fond memories of it but I listened to that album for years to come and still do. It was when Radiohead peaked. The Bends was a great album but lacked the dynamic that Ok Computer had. After that, unfortunately (IMO) they went downhill. Kid A was good. Amnesiac not so much...the rest all just blend together as some sort of whale noise experimentation ...but for a brief period in time. Ok Computer opened the minds of a lot of people sick and tired of listening to the most formulaic top 40 shit the industry could muster up.

	<TEXT> Holy shit u/mlnznz , I came to comment that if he's not listening to Daniel Johnston he should be.   
OP you have a very similar sound to Daniel Johnston.   
...a little Wreckless Eric in there too.



Your singing is unique but can definitely be improved upon without giving up your sound. Work on breathing and enunciation. Pretty cool song and I love the "om" symbol which coincidentally I used for years on all my songs.

	<TEXT> I share this problem. Recently I've stopped setting 5 alarms as I find this annoys the shit out of me even more. Especially when the snoozes start overlapping and I'm not even falling back to sleep just wait for the next snooze to go off again...dismissing them is a bad idea since I'll just sleep through.  
  
So what I've done to adjust this insane early morning cycle is to set 1 alarm for 1 1/2 before I have to get up and then another Real alarm for 30mins before I need to be up. The first alarm goes off early but it preps me for the next I know is coming in an hour. I don't snooze this one, I dismiss it. I know the real alarm is going off in an hour.   
 I've found this method works. When the first alarm goes off I know I have an hour left in bed and that when the second alarm goes off there is no room for snoozing. Good luck, you are not alone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pointing out the hypocrisy of someone complaining about the outcome of an election they couldn't be bothered participating in is not "acting superior", it's acting responsibly.  
 If someone doesn't want to participate that's ok.  
 If someone does that's ok too.  
 But not participating and complaining about the results is idiotic. If you can't be bothered to cast a vote why should I be bothered listening to your opinions on the matter. 
Voting took 15 mins out of my morning. It sounds like you didn't vote and chose to keep the masturbatory at home. 
You might be right that 1 vote wouldn't have swayed the election but a thousand may have. That's how democracy works.   
  
49% of the population chose not to vote on Tuesday. 100% of the population had an opinion on Wednesday. I'm not acting superior, just pointing out the paradox.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are big problems with heroin in a lot of the former Industrial heavy cities along the I-90 corridor in Upstate NY. Albany/Utica/Syracuse/Rochester/Buffalo. They would fit the lower-middle class suburban demographic you are trying to show and visually the cities are probably exactly what you're looking for.   
  
You could stretch that corridor into Boston, MA..not sure what the heroin situation is like in a city that big but it links up geographically.  </TEXT>
