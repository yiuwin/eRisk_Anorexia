	<TEXT> I fucking hate this so much. Especially when you tell them "from here" and then they crinkle their nose and have this dumb confused look on their face, and then ask you again, like you're retarded or weren't aware of the answer you gave the first time. Grrr </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It might just be his way of flattering you? It looks like he's just taking every compliment you give him and dishing it out to you twofold. 


Or maybe this is his way of making for certain that you are as interested in him as he is in you? It's like he's kind of digging for you to say something like "Oh no you're amazingly hot and cute and totally in my league..." kind of like fishing for compliments. 


It is kind of a strange though.

	<TEXT> Aww thank you! 


I've tried explaining to her that her "jokes" aren't appropriate, but that always leads to more arguing.I think your method where I leave might just work, because she won't be expecting it. 

And he does, thank you for well wishes! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you feel about the fact that many clinicians and mental healthcare professionals refuse to treat people suffering with BPD, because of the unpredictability and intensity of the wide ranging symptoms (such as breach of personal space/privacy of their clinician/professional)? Have you ever experienced these issues?


Also, many doctors and clinicians nowadays have compiled evidence to support the notion that bpd is not, in fact, a "legitimate" mental health disorder, because of the disparity in the prevalence rates between western countries (such as the U.S.) and the rest of the world. For example, schizophrenia, which is observed in about the same abundance worldwide is considered unarguably a "real" mental health disease to mental health professionals. What is your opinion on this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, as a psych student, I have to ask. I hope you don't take offense, but was your mother present during your upbringing? 


If so, was she the same body shape that you're attracted to? Was she pleasant/offer you a lot of attention?

Also, what part do you find attractive? Is it the actual appearance of the extra flesh or how it feels to you?

	<TEXT> Hey, well now that I think of it,  I'm pretty sure I wrote this when I was a very depressed, melancholy  teenager. 


Nowadays I don't have that overarching feeling of doom and anger following me everywhere I go. Instead it kind of comes and goes and that's because I've learned some coping mechanisms, though if I'm not consistent with my self-therapy, shit can get bad real quick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> being human sucks. shit never works out. sometimes we might think things are working out because we get this tiny feeling of satisfication and maybe even joy at small precious moments. and we try to hold onto those for dear life. but in the end its nothing compared to the shit storm awaiting on the other side. anyways i want to close my eyes and not have to be here but that doesnt work. sometimes, you have to be brave and not think of the consquences. sometimes you have to be in the moment and do what feels right. people think that killing yourself is the cowards way out. to me sucide is the bravest thing you can do. you're venturing into the unknown. a place that no man has ever gone to and come back to tell others of. how is this cowardice?you're taking yourself and putting yourself in a place where all you've heard of are dark forboding stories of hell and torture and worse of all unknowningness. this isn't cowardice. cowardice is putting up with life's relentless plundering of your soul without standing up and saying enough is enough. cowardice is willingly taking the incessant moments of raw tedium and convincing yourself that you are important in a system where billions like you exist and share the same exact experiences as you. cowardice is believing that you are beneficial to the world when in reality you are nothing will become nothing and in the rare occurence that you do become something you will return to your nothingness. have you ever read plato's story of the cave? everyone was convinced that their world, in the dark cave was the real deal, and there was nothing beyond that cave. well im sick of being in this cave. im sick of people telling me that all i have to look forward to are puppeteered versions of reality on a wall of nothing. i want to know the truth. im sick of social conventions brainwashing me to belive death is a bad thing. im going to be brave and im going to see what's beyond that wall. beyond this dark cave.  </TEXT>
