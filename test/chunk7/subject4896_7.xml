	<TEXT> I think that the trade screen would get the 'Trade tiles' option, when clicked you would be transferred to the map with the option to select tiles you would like from them (similar to city screen where you select which tiles you want to work on). You could only select the tiles adjacent to your border so they wouldn't get messy. </TEXT>
