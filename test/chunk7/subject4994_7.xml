	<TEXT> He seems very clutch. He has had quarters where he takes over the game and carries the team on his shoulder. 

I get that Steph is incredible, and probably a bit banged up, but in all seriousness, Thompson is not that far behind Curry - meaning the Warriors are going to be insanely good for a long time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I were LeBron, I would leave. This team looks like garbage. Kyrie isn't a winner. Cleveland wasn't good while he was the main star. Love isn't a winner either. His Minnesota teams were awful. 

LeBron is the only real winner on the team. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No idea. But if you think about it, Minnesota wasn't good with Love, Cleveland wasn't good with just Irving - LeBron is still the only winner on the team.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't like the change. It makes sense for pictures to be posted chronologically. If there are peoples posts that I don't want to see, I will simply stop following them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I get what you are saying, I don't necessarily agree. I feel a lot of startups attract talent because it is a way to make big money fast. 

And it doesn't always take lots of experience to be successful. As proved by companies like [Snapchat](http://techcrunch.com/gallery/a-brief-history-of-snapchat/), Facebook, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me clarify. 

There are many people out there who have good ideas, but don't quite know how to take the first step. I am hoping this will be a place where they connect with people who **do** know how to do those things that you mentioned. 

It's really no different from other entrepreneurs who just start out with an idea and learn as they go.

	<TEXT> I am hoping to overcome my fear and quit my job, sell my car, and start my own business. Fear keeps telling me that I'll never make it, but I just have to go for it.

	<TEXT> I have been looking at finding remote work as well, and it has been difficult for me. I am currently working for a company, but would enjoy the ability to work from anywhere in the world. 

I would love to hear advice on how to do this. I also feel like a jack-of-all-trades as it goes to marketing.  </TEXT>
