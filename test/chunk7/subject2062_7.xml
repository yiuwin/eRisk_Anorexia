	<TEXT>  You realize that many of the men were drafted into a war right?

In the U.S. maybe, here in Germany no. Baby boomers here in Germany were born in the 1950ish and later. Germany has not been in a war when people born at that time where in the armed forces.

 Not to mention the millions of black baby boomers who were basically strugglingly like hell to even have the most basic rights. 

Again maybe in the U.S. but not everywhere. Don't assume everybody is in the U.S.

 No generation has it easy.

Never said that, also never claimed that our hardships are the same as theirs

 But millions of non-white non-middle class people around the world have it a hell of a lot easier today than they did any time in prior history.

True but still, we face problems nowadays that are not easy and in my opinion for the most part outweight wars. Seriously our planet is fucked, because generations before us did not seem care about it and the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I never understood that either. Granted a pit bull has more chance to do damage if it attacks. But a well trained pit bull is as likely to attack as a well trained any other dog. The problem is that many pit bulls are not trained properly, because people get them for the "image" they provide.

I'm not a dog owner, never have been, but I still know that a bad behaving dog says more about the owner than about the dog. At least that's what I think. Because it tells me you did not train your dog right.

Also the only I dog I ever considered attacking was a little ball of fur that was picking at my heel one night I was at a park with a few friends just hanging out. I was considering punting that little fucker into the river. </TEXT>

I'm not sure if that's true though, because on one hand yeah it kind of makes sense, because later on the cologne settles and part of it may have gone away, but I'm not sure if that's on purpose or not. Do you know anything about that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In all languages I know Math.random() (or the quivalent) returns a random number between 0 and 1 (while 0 is inclusive and 1 is exclusive). So a function could be like this:

    function randomInt(min, max) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + max;
    }

If you happen to use it on many places throughout your code it may be a good idea to make a function like this and reuse it. But if you only need it at one place it may not be worth the hassle to extract it into a function.

In general your school is right though you should write the same code as less as possible at best only once, so you need to change it at as few places as possible. But in reality that is not always possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your solution is slower though. With the "ugly" way you only have one call to Math.random() and Math.floor() and not one for every digit. Also the solution with the loop takes up more memory because it keeps the number two times in it, once as the array the second time then as a string/integer.

I know in this case it does not matter, but it may matter on a larger scale though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  LoL profits dwarf DOTA 2's profits. Im not sure of the exact numbers at the moment. It was like 20 times or something crazy. There's an easy to find link...the two games by the numbers.

Then would you be so kindly to provide the link? I don't make that claim and it's not my resposibility to prove it. I'm not saying that LoL does not make more money but the dimension seems a bit odd at least. Either the numbers are old or skewered.

 This prize pool is jacked up by Valve to get some hype going, DOTA 2 wants a bigger cut of the MOBA pie that League is hogging right now.

What? The prizepool started at 1.6 Million USD and the rest of the over 18 Million USD was provided by the community. If you think Valve provided some if it. I don't know but I don't believe it. Why would they? Honestly I don't think that a big prizepool alone is generating hype at least not for me or the people I know.

 DOTA 2 wants a bigger cut of the MOBA pie that League is hogging right now.

That I agree Valve wants a bigger share, but I don't know if they would spend so much on it if it's not generating revenue for them.

 I mean the games are really similar

Eh only if one does not look to close. If you spend a bit of time in both you will see the differences and how huge the impact on the games are. I'm not saying either is better, but they are different enough that they do to a degree cater to different people.


 DOTA 2 and LoL are both great, and I feel Leagues biggest advantage is its head start.

Yes, the head start is actually really big part. I don't know which game would be ahead if they started at the same time. And yes both games are great. </TEXT>

Alas we don't have keys anymore in Dota 2. The chests/crates can be bought in the Dota 2 store and are unlocked right away, also you are guaranteed 1 set/item out of a chest and if buy a second chest you are guaranteed to not get the same one a second time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey,

ich versuche deine Fragen nach bestem Wissen und Gewissen zu beantworten, aber nimm nicht alles als 100% wahr hin. Es entspricht nur meinen Erfahrungen.

1. Ich habe leider nicht den richtigen Arzt gefunden, aber es ist vollkommen okay erstmal bei mehreren vorzusprechen um den (oder die) Richtige zu finden. Generell wird jeder Psychiater und auch Psychologe die ersten 2 oder 3 Sitzungen machen ehe er eine entsprechende Therapie bei deiner KK beantragt.
2. Zum einem habe ich im Internet gesucht zum anderem aber auch meinen Hausarzt gefragt ob er da Informationen oder Kontakte hat. Frs Internet empfehle ich die Seite der KKV aus deiner Region.
3. Es gibt keine allgemeinen Kriterien. Mach Termine und schau wie du dich bei dem Arzt fhlst. Es ist wichtig, dass du dich wohl fhlst.
4. Psychologen gehren wohl zu den rzten die mit am meisten Termine haben, daher haben sie nicht so viel Zeit fr Sprechzeiten oder Anrufe. Die Meisten bei denen ich versucht habe, hatten tagsber nur einen Anrufbeantworter auf den man gesprochen hat und dann wurde man zurck gerufen. Und ja meistens gehen Sie selbst ans Telefon.
5. Mir persnlich ist es egal, aber wie gesagt du musst dich wohl fhlen.
6. Such dir einen Arzt bei dem du dich wohl fhlst, das ist meiner Meinung nach das wichtigste. Es geht dabei um dich und der Arzt kann dir nur helfen wenn du dich bei ihm sicher und geborgen fhlst.


P.S. Ich nutze hier oftmals mnnliche Pronomen, das hat einfach den Sinn der Einfachheit sowohl beim Schreiben als auch beim Lesen. Bitte versteht es geschlechtsneutral. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm responsible for the deaths of Africans and Arabs just because I think Germany is the home of German people?

If you refuse a person in disgress help because you want to keep your country "clean" then yes you are responsible for it. Refugees are more often than not not here because they fancy it so or because they like Germany so much and want to live here, but because they are in imminent danger if they stay in their home country. They are human beings and as such they have the human rights. Article 3 of these state:

 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.

So you want to take that right of of them because you feel like this little bit of soil is German and should be the home of German people. Hate to break the news for you, but you have a serious problem if that's really what you think.


 f it makes me racist that I think we should be looking for other solutions than stuffing these holes with Turks, Arabs and Africans, whose cultures are in no way related to ours, who don't give 2 shits about our culture and about whose cultures I don't give 2 shits, then yes, I am racist.

Glad you see that you are racist. Honestly though most "Turks, Arabs and Africans" I know are aware of our culture and respect it. They do some things different, but that's okay, because they have the fucking right to do it that way. Once via the human rights and second via our Grundgesetz. Also if you don't give 2 shits about their culture maybe not only they, but also you are "the problem"? Instead of hating the other culture without knowing it without interacting with it how about an open exchange with it? Why not talk with people from other cultures and learn about "their" ways and teach them about "our" ways and "our" culture?

The whole thing is not something simple and no taking them the right to take refugee in our country is no solution and never will be a soltion. If it changes anything it spures up hate from the people in need and honestly in my opinion that leads to more problems all in all.

We are all humans there is not a big difference between "them" and "us". What little difference there is should not matter if there are lives on the stake. </TEXT>

For example "Das" can become "dat" or "dit" depending who I talk to. So I actually would've to choose both answers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just played a game as AM where we lost after 50mins. I went 6:7:1 with the highest GPM and second highest XPM, but it all went to shit, because by the time I was readish to join the fights the enemies were to farmed.

Early I was pressured in lane and even through I had a WW in my lane I couldn't go to last hit. So my BF took a bit to long. I'm just not sure if I should've got another item first so that I could've joined fights earlier or not.

So please advice on how to handle such a lane and how to farm more effective are much appreciated, also pointing out errors I made is also welcome, with a hint/tip how to do better.

Here is the [dotabuff](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1683005466) link to the match.

	<TEXT>  easier to install than Windows by far

Haha, no just no. I installed many Windows and many Linuxes in the last few years. Many different Distros and at no point was a Linux setup as easy as the Windows pendant. Where the installation of Linux is better is individualizing right from the get go. I don't say the installation process is worse, but not easier. My last Win 8.1 install took about 40mins from the first boot up on DVD. For the most part I wasn't even needed I just sat before the screen and watched.  
The last Linux I installed was a Suse and while it was not hard or bad, it took longer and it needed to know way more stuff from me, stuff that some users may not know shit about.

Every one can choose what everyone wants. I actually like both systems, but I use Windows for my main PC because I'm a gamer and I play games that are not ported to Linux. I'm not even sure if I would use Linux then, because the difference would not be as big as many people say and I currently do have Windows installed.

All I think we all should stop with the hate. Windows is far from it's bad times and even hardcore Linuxer like my boss say it's decent enough for the most people. And Linux has come a long way to be more user friendly and easier to access. Also there is a place for both OS. </TEXT>

Problem with that is that you need to go to school to get a decent job for the most part. Sadly same goes for Germany for the most part. But then again studying in Germany is far cheaper than in the U.S.

Oh and don't misunderstand me the U.S. has many things that are  better than in Germany, but the social security is much higher in Germany, which I prefer over earning more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The US having more debt is simply bad consumer/personal choices, not an indictment of the system.

There I disagree. Just the debt you get/can get from college and university is not funny. Honestly with such a start in the professional life you have a life full of debt before you.

 as everyone I know in Germany can't afford to literally buy anything

I disagree there I live in Germany my family is not rich nor really poor, but we can buy all the stuff we need and still have money left.


Also don't forget that I did say that there are bad things about our system, but at least it's not as ruthless against poorer people like the one in the U.S. health care alone is reason enough for me to favor the German systems 99 out of 100 times. </TEXT>

Also better to have a constant and calculated amount of money you have to pay but get cheaper and more calculateable healthcare costs for it.

I'm not saying that everything in the German system is fine and dandy, but it's way better than the system in the U.S. which basiclly fucks you over if you loose a job. Oh and don't forget that 2011 [69% of all households in the U.S. had a debt of some kind](https://www.census.gov/people/wealth/files/Debt%20Highlights%202011.pdf), while in [Germany only 47% had debts](https://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BBK/2013/2013_03_21_phf.html).

	<TEXT> IANAL so here is how I understand the problem with it.

We in Germany have something called the GEMA, which centralizes the rights of music artists under itself. If you want to publicy play anything that contains GEMA protected(?) music you have to pay a certain fee. Youtube says the fee of the GEMA is to high, while GEMA wants to apply the normal rate to YouTube.  
YouTube now blocks everything that may containt music that is protected by the GEMA to prevent them from sueing the shit out of YouTube. Afaik their content id system does this automatically for videos, but for livestreams it does not work. So the easiest solution from their point of view is to just block it completly. </TEXT>

Yes and no. It all depends on what you say is filthy. I take an RB (regional train) to work everyday. And while it may not be mega super clean and sometimes there are cars with graffity on the outside in general they are clean enough for the pupose.

Delays up to 5 minutes are to be expected. Let's say you train should come at 8:29 it's completly normal that it may come at 8:31 wihtout any information. Longer delays are not that common in my experience but they happen.

In general I always say that the DB is not perfect, but when considering the size of the network they have I think they are pretty good. All in all I think our public transportaion system in Germany is better than in many other countries, even in Europe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She also said that she just barley didn't cheat on him on multiple occasion don't forget that. There is more than just the sexual attraction that led to this.

No she isn't an angel, nor is she a deamon for ending a relationship before she cheated on the other person. Personaly I think that it takes courage to do so. Because you hurt the person, but you spare them most likely bigger pain.

Yes what she did maybe wasn't optimal, yes she is not an angel, but she is neither is there a reason to shame for it like you did. If she didn't love him anymore, which I think is safe to assume as she feels no remorse over breaking up with him, it's in her and his best interest to end it right there and not keep on dragging it out, which most likely hurts more.

Also your argument about the future is total bullshit. Sure she may have "thrown away" a nice looking future but maybe she got a even better one now? We can't fucking see in the future so there is no reason do dwell upon it in cases like this. </TEXT>

However I would wager that I had it for longer than that. For me the problem is not the eating or that I don't like it, I love a good meal. However I can go days or weeks without eating properly. It's hard to explain, but it's tied into my depression, which I have developed (don't know if that's the right word) shortly after my parents divorced, because I can't really talk about feelings and stuff. I use the not eating kind of as punishment for myself if I mad a mistake e.g. hurt the feelings of a person who is important to me.

It's all rather complicated and I know I should start seein a therapist about it, but it's so freaking hard to break the cycle. I actually started seeing one about a year ago and then didn't go there anymore, because I don't even know why. So yeah. </TEXT>

Also the part where he said that he should've pointed some of the things out in the first video?

Hate to say it, but if you won't hear out both sides you are in my opinion just an idiot who likes his pitfork way to much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well Number 4 is how it should be. Like my father says "Du entschuldigst dich nicht, sondern bittest um Entschuldigung" which would translate roughly to "You don't apologize but ask for pardon" or something like that. It means that the person you are apoligizing to has no obligation to accept it.

Also in German you normally have to say "Ich bitte um Entschuldigung" the short form "Entschuldigung" or it various forms are just that a short form, they still mean that you asks for the party involved to accept your apology. It's not that common nowadays that the person does not accept it, but it may happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know the excat weight, but the rims are aluminum not carbon fibre. The front rims are 10 x 15 in the back rims 14 x 15 in. The tire are Firestone Firehawks. I would guess, that they are slightly lighter than consumer wheels, but not super light weight at all.

I know for a fact that there where accidents where people where hit by flying Formular 1 tires and died. I would assume simmilar accidents happened at the Indy races. Thus they use this kind of saftey harness to prevent the tire from flying around.

	<TEXT>  The wheels are probably super lightweight compared to consumers stuff.

No, they are quite heavy as far as I know.

 Could be a brake cable.

Again no, that is most likely a saftey cable to keep the wheel attached to the car so it doesn't go flying around and maybe hitting people, which in most cases is fatal. I know for a fact that the Formula 1 has something like that so I assume that Indy and other races have something like that too. It's just to dangerous to have a wheel go flying around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because imho it's stupid to write in two languages while there are many more languages that have the same "rights" as the two. I think we should keep this sub English, at least with mod posts and such. </TEXT>
