	<TEXT>  They don't need a better data, they simply need more of it.

Collecting lots of bad data doesn't change that data into good data, it just means you have lots of bad data.

 And when you passively increase the value of things that have no value the market becomes distorted and you get wage unequality.

This is complete nonsense in every way. Have you ever even taken a course in economics?

1) Creating value ex nihlo makes people richer, not poorer. Oil is worthless if you don't have any use for it; once you have a use for it, it becomes valuable. Having uses for more things makes people richer. As value is passively generated, it makes people much wealthier.

2) None of this has anything at all to do with wage inequality. It isn't even relevant.

 The prices of things that are actually necessary for your survival go up because the amount of money big companies are making goes up.

This is pure nonsense and has absolutely no relationship with reality whatsoever.

Inflation is when something which has the same value costs more tomorrow than it did yesterday. If something has more value tommorrow than it did yesterday, its value going up isn't inflation.

This is basic economics. If people make cars that are twice as good but cost 50% more, that isn't inflation, that is a quality improvement.

 So their total amount of real money goes down so that they can purchase all these vibes.

Ah, I see. You don't understand economics on even the most basic of levels.

See, here's the problem with everything you believe: it is wrong.

**Economies do not have a fixed size.**

The size of your economy is related to the total value produced by that economy. If you produce more value, the size of your economy increases.

You are making the completely, totally, and utterly flawed assumption that people buying data have less money for other purposes. This is 100% wrong.

The reason why they buy the data is because it is profitable. The data provides a return-on-investment above what they spent on it. Thus, they actually end up with *more* money, because the data allow them to make more money.

If they didn't, they wouldn't buy the data. The fact that a lot of people buy data suggests that it is valuable.

If you buy worthless data and go out of business, that's no different from any other stupid investment made by a company - buying a worthless factory, or worthless land, or worthless real estate, or employing worthless people.

But if data is genuinely valuable, then it only adds value to the economy.

You don't understand economics.

 But to make the money back that they lost buying the vibes, they have to sell more products at the same price as before.

You don't understand how this stuff works.

Typically speaking, data is used for several reasons:

1) Directed advertising. Sending advertising out in all directions is expensive. If you send it in the correct direction only, it is much cheaper. This is an improvement in efficiency, which means they're getting more results from the same amount of advertising dollars spent.

2) Better advertising. They can see if an ad is good or bad and make more use of the good ads and less use of bad ones. This, again, is an improvement in efficiency.

3) Better production targets. They know what their audience wants so they produce products which their audience wants and fewer products that they don't. This is again an improvement in efficiency, but this time on the production side rather than the sales side - they're producing products which better meet their customers' needs, and fewer products which don't meet their customers' needs.

4) Exploiting new market niches. Finding out that there's a market for something and nothing really fills it allows them to produce a new good which fills said unfilled niche.

The first three all result in more revenue for the same amount of money, or the same amount of revenue for less money.

The idea that this inherently drives up the price of goods is simply wrong.

Everything you believe is wrong because it is based on incorrect views of how the world works. </TEXT>

If you wanted to do something other than stutter step at the maximum rate of fire, you'd need to do so manually as there's not really any convenient shortcut for avoiding that, but doing it at maximum firing speed should just be a default command like attack is. Indeed, attack could even function that way by default (and actually sort of already does with melee attacks on fleeing characters).

Only terrible game designers insert crap for no reason other than to make characters more difficult to control. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Illusion of choice

This has nothing to do with the wheel. Realistically speaking, most games don't have very many significant options at all; almost everything in most games is the illusion of choice. There's generally only a few significant choices available in a game, and most games, they only marginally change things because you just can't produce multiple separate games.

Chrono Cross is one of the very few games where the choices you made had a large impact on the story, as there are two fairly big chunks of the game which are different based on which path you take.

Such things almost never involve more than three real choices, and often only two.

 ultimately gives your character zero effectual personality. You're making the choice to be a smartass or not and that's it. 

The ME games had about two major threads for it; DA2 had three. Defining the personality of your character isn't nothing, though; in fact, that's actually a big part of roleplaying. </TEXT>

This isn't actually true. Increasing the amount of mechanical skill necessary to play the game correctly is actually a bad thing; it would be better if you could auto-stutter step (like, say, there was a command that made it so if you used it, you'd automatically stutter step fire).

That said, you're right about the rest - it is a significant mechanical difference as it means you can't move and attack at the same time, so if you stop to attack someone, you're moving more slowly than you would be otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  the one time D D tried to stray away from that and actually really try to grow out, it got rejected really hard because that's not what D D fans want - they want more of the same.

To be fair, a lot of people liked 4th edition. People forget how popular it was, but there were tons of people who played it.

The people who hated it really hated it, though. The thing is...

1) A lot of people don't want to play D D, they just want to play. Most people who "play" 3.x (including Pathfinder) have absolutely no idea how the game "really" works on a deeper level. If you start playing a lot of the classes as they're meant to be played, you'll end up being hideously overpowered compared to normal players. Playing a caster correctly, for instance, will completely break the game, as casters can negate entire encounters with 1-2 spells in many cases. If you don't understand why color spray and glitterdust are good, you don't really understand D D 3.x. Showing any real degree of system mastery in 3.x will upset a lot of players because it will show them that they don't really understand how the game works on a basic level, as they're trying to make good characters, they're just really bad at it.

2) D D is *horribly* complicated. It had major system bloat over time, and 3.x was hideously complicated as a system. People spent ages learning it, and then when 4th came along, it was completely different and was also very complicated. A lot of people didn't want to learn another complicated system from scratch, as they in most cases didn't even really understand 3.x.

3) 4th edition was designed to be a very tactically-oriented game. Everyone has a role to play, and everyone matters. If you just rush in and attack the orc, you're going to be in trouble, because the game is *designed* around creating tactically complicated scenarios. If you don't like tactics and teamwork, 4th edition isn't for you, because it is all about tactics and teamwork.

Really, a lot of people use D D when they shouldn't be using it in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pathfinder is really bloated. It is a really badly designed system, most of the options in it are traps (i.e. are very suboptimal - indeed, pretty much any non-caster *class* is a trap, as they're all quite bad compared to casters), it is overcomplicated for what it is trying to do, ect.

3.x (which includes pathfinder) is just a really fiddly system in general with major balance issues.

Not that 5th edition is balanced, mind you (casters are way better than non-casters) but the power gap is smaller and it is simpler in general.

4th edition is the only edition of D D where I really felt like it achieved its rules goals. 4th is a great game, but it isn't for everyone, as it is very tactically oriented. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> D D is best for fairly combat heavy fantasy campaigns. 4th edition is probably the best edition ever for tactical combat encounters, and creates a lot of interesting situations, but all D D systems are heavily focused on combat.

Non-combat isn't really something that D D is really focused on or well-suited for, especially not 3rd edition onwards. It isn't that it can't do it, it is just that the system isn't really optimized for it. Editions other than 4th edition had major issues with casters having all the best combat and non-combat tools; 4th edition equalized non-combat tools heavily between classes, which leads to a more balanced result, but people's powers are all focused on combat so your class matters a lot less outside of combat.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but it leads to some weirdness in some players' minds, and unfortunately, a big part of class-based design is trying to ensure that everyone can meaningfully contribute. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is very easy to find studies which make the claims in question. There are lots of them. Vegans are infamous liars, after all.

The problem is that they don't actually show what is claimed.

Take this study, for instance (the second off your list - I couldn't get at the text of the first one for some reason):

https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/98/5/345/2522006/Meat-Intake-and-Risk-of-Stomach-and-Esophageal

This study is 100% worthless. It claims that there is a correlation between meat intake and various health problems.

The issue is that they're measuring it using servings of meat consumed per day.

This is worthless. Why?

Because the health issues in question here are associated with obesity, which is dependent on *absolute* caloric intake.

As it turns out, the more you eat, the fatter you get.

This means, in other words, that servings of meat is nothing more than an indirect proxy for caloric intake - someone who eats 10 servings of meat per day (which would be about 1500 Calories of meat alone!) is probably eating a diet close to 5000 Calories per day.

Obviously, anyone who eats that many calories per day is either going to be morbidly obese or is [The Rock.](http://www.muscleandfitness.com/nutrition/meal-plans/smell-what-rock-cooking)

Of course someone who is eating 5,000 calories per day is unhealthy. This is to be expected!

But it doesn't tell you that meat is bad for you.

The proper way to do a study like this would be to take a cohort of people eating the same number of calories per day, with the same BMI and same overall level of activity, and compare between people who are eating more meat vs, say, other food sources. This would give you a better picture of whether or not meat was responsible, or if it was other factors.

Any dietary study which fails to control for caloric intake is basically going to be worthless in any conclusions about health conditions which might be linked to obesity.

Welcome to "why most dietary studies are complete bullshit" - because as it turns out, doing them correctly not only is a lot more work and requires better tracking, but usually just ends up verifying the null hypothesis (no effect) or has very low power/significance.

Looking at absolute servings of food is useful for an obesity study, but it isn't really useful for determining whether one food is healthier than another in an observational setting for determining whether or not a food has a positive or deletorious effect on someone's health, because greater consumption of anything correlates with greater consumption of everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is, it is likely whatever temperature system they use is a holdover from whenever they started standardizing stuff, which means that the triple point of hydrogen is a very unlikely starting point.

Centigrade uses boiling and freezing because they are important temperatures to humans; it also leads to a relatively reasonable temperature scale.

Something using 13.84K as a single degree isn't very useful for everyday purposes; it would involve a lot of decimals, and if the 0 point was absolute zero, the difference between freezing cold and quite warm would only be 5 degrees. It would make temperatures look very weird.

While it is possible someone's scientific Kelvin-equivalent system might use such units, the reality is that making use of the same units as your main system uses is often far more convenient for gathering data. Kelvin is useful from a scientific standpoint, but most people don't measure or state temperatures in Kelvin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fahrenheit was more or less designed to put human body temperature at close to 100 F, which is pretty arbitrary from an alien standpoint. Freezing and boiling are 180 F apart - a nice, round number (if somewhat weird).

It is likely that aliens will have some Kelvin-equivalent system, and it wouldn't be surprising to see a Centigrade-equivalent system. It is unlikely that their units would be identical to ours, though - their atmospheric pressure is likely to deviate a bit at least, they might define some different elevation other than sea level as their standard even if they have the same general atmospheric pressure as ours, they may use a different numeric base for their numbering system (humans probably use base 10 because we have 10 fingers, but things like 12 and 60 have been used because they're conveniently divisible).

Halfway between boiling and freezing is not an unusual concept, and I wouldn't be surprised if a centigrade-type system was pretty common. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Nearly all dietary studies are based on correlation.

Which is why nearly all dietary studies are nigh-worthless. Correlation is not causation, and a lot of dietary studies fail to even attempt to control for various important factors.

For instance, there was a vegan elsewhere on the thread who linked to a study which claimed that eating more red meat lead to greater risk of diabetes.

The problem is that the study wasn't about what *fraction* of someone's diet was red meat, but about the *absolute amount* of red meat they ate was. This is worthless; people who eat more red meat are eating more calories in general. People who eat more calories become overweight or obese. Obesity causes type 2 diabetes.

Making any claims of correlation between the two without controlling for that is like [claiming that there's a correlation between the number of nesting storks in an area and the number of out of hospital births.](https://web.stanford.edu/class/hrp259/2007/regression/storke.pdf) Yes, the two are correlated, but the cause is that rural areas have more storks and fewer hospitals due to lower human population density.

It is a worthless, misleading statement and shitty study design.

If you want to compare the risk of diabetes via an observational study, what should you do is you take populations who are of the same BMI, race, and who exercise equally regularly and you look at their diets and look at how the disease rates differ between the populations.

But as it turns out, if you do this, you aren't going to get these big eye-popping numbers, and it is a lot more work, and you'll pretty much always get the null hypothesis.

So you have fraudsters making shitty studies like that because it promotes their ideology and because it gets their name out there.

I'm used to reading shitty scientific papers. In fact, when I was in college, one of the things we'd do was cut apart bullshit papers.

 And just as with cigarettes from the 1950s onward it is unethical to feed people a diet you believe will give them a chronic, debilitating health condition

Yup. Which is why it is unethical to feed people vegan diets, especially children.

Have you ever looked for studies of the outcomes of children whose parents fed them vegan diets?

They're *quite* informative.

As it turns out, many vegans do not eat properly balanced vegan diets. This isn't great for adults, but it is very bad for children. In particular, hypocalciemia is a major issue for a kid. Vegan diets are to blame for the recent resurgence of rickets, you know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That you're suggesting the link between industrial TFAs and negative health consequences is shaky really undermines your credibility.

A lot of people don't understand just how weak the evidence is.

How do you think they found the link?

The answer is via observational studies.

But observational studies are systematically flawed - they aren't randomized. This is a major issue when it comes to diet, because diets are highly non-random. Poor people eat lots of ostensibly "unhealthy food".

What's the problem? The problem is that poor people tend to be less healthy in general. Is the food unhealthy, or is it that the people who tend to eat such foods also tend to be unhealthy to begin with, and the food is fine?

As it turns out, this is basically an impossible question to answer without experimental study. But it is unethical to dose people with a potentially toxic substance to see if it is actually toxic.

 The idea that cholesterol is bad for you has been shown again and again to increase your risks of negative health outcomes. I don't know where you're getting the idea that it's been discredited.

[This has been known for years.](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/panel-suggests-stop-warning-about-cholesterol-in-food-201502127713)

The reason is pretty trivial - they did studies on it. They found that blood cholesterol levels weren't influenced by dietary cholesterol levels, but by other factors.

 That's a clever joke to make there, but it's clear you haven't read the literature if you think the links between red meat consumption and cancer or diabetes is 0.

It isn't a joke. Obesity is linked to these things. What you eat isn't.

 Why are we talking about some plants containing potential carcinogens, here I thought we were talking about red meat.

Because literally everything contains "toxins".

 Studies associate red meat consumption with cancer, they show an inverse relationship between high fruit and veg consumption and cancer.

It has nothing to do with red meat consumption. The cause is obesity. People who eat more high-calorie foods are more obese on average. That doesn't mean red meat is bad for you; it means obesity is bad for you.

The correlation is caused by that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Stop using the word "controlled" to make your opinion sound more important.

It isn't my opinion. It's a fact!

There's no evidence that switching to an equivalent vegetarian or vegan diet has any health benefits.

 No, it means it's difficult to understand when there's a lot of variables and a controlled experiment is impossible. It means data are more open to attack, but it doesn't mean we just throw our hands up and say oh well guess food science is out.

Controlled experiments are indeed possible.

The reason people seldom do them is because they are expensive and almost always yield negative results - i.e. the hypothesis in question was wrong.

People don't like publishing null results, so they use garbage studies to get positive results that they can show off.

That's the cold, dark reality of it.

Controlled dietary studies do exist, and have been done on things like weight loss, energy balance, and looking at whether or not enriching someone's diet with a supplement lead to positive long-term health effects.

But the thing is, everyone knows deep down inside that there's little evidence that what we eat in particular really matters much. Thi is a problem, seeing as saying "eating X or Y is good/bad for you!" is a great way to attract attention and write books.

So the result is massive amounts of garbage. Most dietary studies are worthless. This is hardly unique to dietary science, of course (everyone remembers the infamous Why Most Published Research Findings Are Wrong paper), but it is particularly problematic in food science precisely because of the various factors involved.

 Alcohol is diet. Charred meat is diet (and quite conclusively bad for you). High sugar is diet (and is well-correlated with type 2 diabetes). Trans fat is diet (and well-correlated with heart disease).

And here we go with the nonsense.

The correlation between eating lots of sugar and diabetes is due to obesity, not due to sugar consumption. People who tend to eat large amounts of sugar tend to consume large amounts of calories, and thus tend to be obese. Indeed, as it turns out, if you look at any type of high-calorie value food, there is a correlation between eating lots of it and getting diabetes, *for exactly the same reason*.

Anyone who actually understands the science knows this. It is why almost all of those studies are 100% worthless.

Any study which looks for correlation between food consumption and obesity *must control for total caloric consumption*. If they fail to do so, the study is 100% worthless, because it is doing nothing more than measuring obesity via an indirect proxy. Indeed, the only reason to do so at this point is fraud.

Also, sorry to break it to you, but the "correlation" between trans fats and heart disease is a lot shakier than it has been made out to be. Different transfats don't seem to show the same correlation, and the studies all suffer from major confounding factors due to demographics (people who eat lots of transfats are demographically different from those who don't).

It isn't to say that they definitely don't cause heart disease, but the evidence is actually quite weak.

There's actually an considerable amount of evidence that the average vegan diet is unhealthy. Beyond the fact that we see gene selection in populations which historically have eaten such diets, suggesting that there is selective pressure for certain genes, many vegans and vegetarians have nutritive deficiencies. Vegans in particular are much more likely than the population as a whole to be deficient in calcium. While a balanced vegan diet can be healthy, the reality is that most people don't actually bother eating a balanced diet at all, and this includes vegans. For normal people, though, the presence of varied animal products prevents certain levels of deficiency. But vegans lack that backstop - if you don't eat some of the few high-calcium vegetables, or eat something which has been supplemented with calcium, you can very easily consume quite marginal amounts of the stuff.

Children who eat vegan diets have worse outcomes than their peers who eat normal diets, indicating that a lot of vegans are eating nutrient-deficient diets, which impacts children worse than adults. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing that a lot of people don't understand is that paying people with data is actually really incredible because it is basically generating an entirely new resource ex nihlo. Data was very difficult to acquire historically; today, it is a lot easier. Passive data collection means that whatever I'm doing generates some value for someone, which is useful because it means that I'm passively creating value while doing something else.

The fact that you can effectively pay for services with data and advertising is amazing and it makes us all vastly wealthier. Google is an absurdly powerful tool - the most powerful tool ever created, arguably - and it is absolutely free to use.

When you see alarmism over this, it really indicates a lack of comprehension of what is going on.

As far as "buying out competition" - the problem with this argument is that while people do this all the time, it doesn't actually necessarily work all that well. Buying out a new company for vastly more than its true value is actually a huge waste of money if the company is going to fail - and contrary to what you believe, big data cannot actually reliably predict this.

This is something a lot of people don't understand. Big data isn't magical. It requires a lot of crunching and interpretation.

The idea that this is going to lead to some sort of dystopian monopolistic future is simply not supported by any data. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You can leave macd for years and bacteria wont consume it

Bacteria (or mold) eating something means nothing. Bacteria won't eat salt or flour, and honey will store for a very, very long time. This isn't because these foods are bad, but because they create a hostile environment for bacteria.

The reason is moisture.

And as it turns out, this is why McDonald's hamburgers "don't go bad" - when you cook meat, it dries it out, but when you leave the meat sitting out, it dries out even more.

If you're familiar with aging meat in general, you'd know that you can actually age meat without it rotting for a shockingly long period of time. The cause is dehydration - there just isn't enough moisture for stuff to grow on it. Without the moisture, it won't grow fuzz because the fuzz needs water to grow.

Indeed, this is how natural mummies are formed - if you die in a really dry environment, your body will dry out and become totally dessicated, which prevents it from rotting. This isn't because there's something "wrong" with your body, it is because of the environment.

On the other hand, leave the body in a wet environment - like, say, a forest - and it will decay quite a bit more rapidly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  First of all, there are no controlled experimental studies on diet in humans purporting cancer risk, period. Perhaps you can think real hard about why.

Because there's not actually good evidence that any foods actually cause cancer, and doing such a study would be an enormous pain in the ass.

 Humans were "designed" (i.e. selected for the majority of our existence) to live short, harsh lives with poor access to protein and sugar.

This is actually completely wrong. Absolute human longevity has barely changed in millennia. The increase in average human lifespans is primarily due to prevention of premature deaths. When 50% of people die before the age of 5, that has a major negative impact on life expectancy at birth. Look at tables like [this](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2011/022.pdf) from the CDC.

Year / Life Expectancy at birth / At age 65 / At age 75

1900 / 47.3 / [11.3](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as116/as116_V.html) / ?

1950 / 68.2 / 13.9 / ?

1980 / 73.7 / 16.4 / 10.4

2010 / 78.7 / 19.1 / 12.1

As you can see, total life expectancy has grown enormously, but life expectancy at age 65 has grown by a lot less (and at 75, by even less). Most of the improvements come from two main areas:

1) Vaccination programs.

2) Much lower rates of smoking. Life expectancy for smokers is [10+ years shorter](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/) than it is for non-smokers.

Indeed, 44% of adults smoked in 1950, compared to only 20% today. 24% * 10 = 2.4 years.

If you look at the age 65 cohort, they've only seen their life expectancy go up 5.2 years in that timespan. So half of that increase in life expectancy is due to fewer people smoking.

 And what you eat has a significant affect on your health. That is not debatable.

There's no real evidence that this is the case. Controlled dietary studies have failed to show any impact.

If the only way you can get "results" is by taking shitty data with lots of confounding variables, it probably means your claimed effect is bullshit.

 What I wrote is correct, there are a lot of studies implicating red meat with health effects. It's not conclusive, since, contrary to what you wrote, there are no controlled experimental studies. But there are a lot of cohort studies based on self-reporting.

The studies are worthless, I'm afraid, for reasons I delineated in my other posts. TL; DR; lack of controls, demographic factors, confounding factors (particularly obesity). </TEXT>

The study, for those wondering, claims that the more meat you eat, the more likely you are to get cancer and diabetes.

The problem is that the actual cause is that people who eat more servings of meat per day tend to eat more servings of everything per day, and the study doesn't control for that. As such, what you're actually measuring is that people who eat more food are more likely to be obese and to develop all of the relevant health problems associated with that - obesity increases your risk of diabetes, cancer, ect.

The idea that obesity is bad for you isn't exactly shocking. But it has nothing to do with meat consumption in particular, and everything to do with total caloric consumption in general. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is that it was obvious garbage. The study claimed that eating more meat correlated with a greater risk of diabetes.

This is unfortunately 100% worthless. Why?

The answer is obvious: calories. Obesity causes diabetes. The more calories you eat, the more food you tend to eat. The more food you tend to eat, the more of everything (including meat) you tend to eat. Someone who eats ten servings of meat a day is very likely to be obese, but that isn't because they're eating meat, it is because they're eating 1600 Calories of meat alone. Someone eating 10 servings of meat is probably eating 5000+ Calories of food a day. They're either morbidly obese or The Rock.

Thus, eating more servings of meat is a worthless metric. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, you cited a study which is total garbage.

The cause of the correlation has nothing to do with meat consumption. It has to do with total caloric consumption.

The more calories you consume, the more servings of meat you will, on average, consume in any given day.

Type 2 diabetes is primarily (60%-80%) caused by obesity.

Thus, you see a correlation between more servings of meat in a day and caloric intake, and thus a correlation between more servings of meat in a day and diabetes.

The cause isn't red meat intake, it is obesity.

Any actual scientist would immediately notice this.

Sadly, no actual scientist was involved with this "meta study". Or as I call it, "fraud".

It should also be noted that observational studies are almost completely worthless when it comes to diet. The problem is that diets are not randomly distributed across the population; poor people, for instance, consume more processed foods. Some very stupid people have claimed this is evidence of processed foods causing a whole host of health problems - but all of the health problems are associated with poor people.

The same applies to numerous other diets - as it turns out, foods associated with wealth will tend to make people appear to live longer. The actual cause is that wealthy people live longer because of better lifestyle, education, medical care, ect.

The gold standard is controlled dietary studies, where you regulate people's food intake and diet and monitor the effects. Such studies have consistently failed to demonstrate the supposed health risks and benefits of many diets. </TEXT>

False, actually! This is one of those Big Lies of vegetarians and vegans.

The problem is, to put it bluntly, vegetarians and vegans are not randomly distributed amongst the population. Vegetarians and vegans are, on average, better off than the general population, and are generally more educated on average - both of which correlate with better health. Indeed, a number of demographic factors correlate with vegetarianism - but it isn't because vegetarianism causes these factors, but because these factors elevate the chances of being vegetarian.

As it turns out, once you take these factors into account, there's no evidence of any health benefits to the diet whatsoever. Indeed, controlled dietary studies of vegetarian and vegan diets have never demonstrated any health benefits whatsoever over omnivorous ones.

This is why observational studies of diet are generally worthless - diets are not randomly distributed in the population. </TEXT>

While lateral gene transfer is a thing, the reality is that it is extremely rare. You aren't going to absorb genes from them.

4) Every person on the planet has toxins in their body. 100% of them. This is because anyone who eats any sort of vegetable matter will ingest toxins, because *all* vegetable matter contains toxins. Moreover, virtually everything which exists contains minuscule amounts of toxins from the environment. This has always been the case and will always be the case. Low levels of toxins are a fact of life, and are harmless. As the saying in toxicology goes, "It is the dose that makes the poison." After all, water is toxic if you drink too much of it.

5) Organic farms are universally horrible, both for the environment and for the wallet. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of any benefits to organic farming at all. None. Nada. Zippo.

6) Non-GMO foods are never tested for safety. There's no evidence that they are safe and no particular reason to believe that they would be. This means, ironically, that GMOs are actually safer than non-GMOs. </TEXT>

There are some people who want to horribly overcharge people for stuff. But how can they do this when their food isn't any better, and is actually somewhat worse?

Well, tell them that the other food is dangerous, of course!

This is combined also with some European protectionism, where farmers in Europe want to prevent cheap food from other countries being imported because European farmers jack up food prices on Europeans. This got them in trouble with the WTO a few years ago, in fact.

A lot of the hatred of GMOs ultimately comes from those two sources.

There's a third source, which are luddities and "environmentalists". The people who oppose hydro power, nuclear power, wind power, ect. Basically, they're against everything. And so they're against GMOs as well because OMG technology is evil. </TEXT>

The reality is that McDonald's is fine for you. There's nothing bad about eating food from McDonald's. A hamburger is fine. French fries are fine. Even soda is fine.

The issue is how much you eat. If you eat too much food, you're going to get fat.

[Fat Head](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FatHead) was a much better documentary about the same subject matter.

The reality is that calories are calories. If you consume a reasonable number of calories, you'll be fine. A number of people have gone on weird stunt diets of "unhealthy" food with no ill effects and indeed improved health simply by not eating too many calories.

In fact, one of the big lies is that there is unhealthy food to begin with. Apart from some outright poisonous foods (like, say, blowfish, or stuff that is heavily contaminated with heavy metals like fish from some polluted water systems, particularly ones at the top of the food chain), generally speaking it doesn't matter much what you eat from a micro sense. On a macro sense, you need to get your essential nutrients and enough calories to power your body. Nothing else has been proven to matter at all in controlled dietary studies.

Observational studies are mostly worthless because the food people consume isn't randomized. People who drink diet sodas are fatter than average. Why? Because fat people tend to drink diet soda and consume "diet" products in general. They're marketed towards such folks with the premise that they will help them lose weight.

They won't, though. Not unless they eat fewer calories. And unsurprisingly, people tend not to.

But you will instead find some very dim folks claiming that diet drinks make you fat. They don't. Cause and effect goes in the opposite direction. </TEXT>

This is hardly surprising; humans are omnivores. Of course they're designed to consume red meat. And white meat. And insects. And fruits and vegetables. And fish. And fungi.

	<TEXT> Tanks are not about creating protective barriers. Tanks are about protecting their teammates. Creating protective barriers is merely one way to do so.

How does Roadhog do this?

By controlling an area, by drawing (and surviving!) aggro, and via stuns.

Reaper is not about area control; he's a DPS. Yes, you don't want to stand right next to reaper, but that's not because he's a tank, it is because he's a short-ranged DPS with ridiculous damage.

Reaper doesn't want to draw aggro and Reaper does not exert a large zone of control. He doesn't have any stun ability, which is often associated with tanks.

Roadhog, conversely, controls about a 20 meter radius around himself, very strongly controls about a 10 meter radius, and draws aggro by being a huge threat. But he's tough to kill, unlike Reaper, who has less than half of Roadhog's health total, and Reaper's only self-heal is from killing people.

Roadhog acts as an initiator as well - his hook pulls someone out of position and often kills them, which starts a teamfight as the other team is now at a huge disadvantage. This is something you see in MOBAs and games like D D, where the tank is the one who starts the fight. D. Va sometimes initiates fights, while Winston is pretty heavily focused on the initiation role of a tank. Roadhog also fills that role.

The fact that you don't directly physically shield your allies is really irrelevant. A tank is really about protecting allies. A healtank or shieldtank - someone who constantly healed people around him, like Lucio, but instead of being a wimpy little fast guy instead being a huge tough thing, or who constantly put up shields on people around them - would force the enemy to choose between attacking people and having to chew through extra health or attacking the tank. This sort of lose-lose situation is a major way for tanks to function, and Roadhog fits into this - if you ignore him to go for his allies, he punishes you heavily for it, but if you attack Roadhog, you have to chew through about 3x as much HP as anyone else.

Defender characters like Torbjorn and Widowmaker also exert zone control, but they aren't tanks because their goal is not to draw aggro but to exert pressure on an area; while they do draw aggro, it isn't their goal or their focus, and they themselves are vulnerable to attack. They also are lacking in stun abilities.

Bastion is a defender-type as well, but he has some tankish tendencies; his turret mode is comparable to the sort of thing that Roadhog does, and he's reasonably tough and forces the enemy team to focus on him. However, he's bad at initiating (only his ultimate allows him to do so, and even then, it isn't the best initiation tool because its optimal usage and his optimal positioning often aren't very close together) and he's also lacking in stuns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Roadhog is an area denial tank. He's tough to kill and can kill you if you get close or try and harass his allies while his hook is up and he's in range. He heavily punishes the enemy for violating his zone of control. He also functions as an initiator.

Tanks are about protecting their allies. Most tanks in Overwatch do so by literally directly doing so; Roadhog functions more like a MOBA or D D tank, in that he draws aggro, acts as an initiator, and is dangerous to ignore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're not the protagonist.

I think this is the hardest thing for people to understand in multiplayer games.

I don't have much of a problem with people listening, which suggests to me that the problem is the way you're approaching the problem. You aren't in charge and you can't tell other people what to do. What you're doing is basically giving suggestions that other people may or may not listen to.

"Taking the reins" won't really help with this problem, and that seems to be your impulse here. You think you're the protagonist, but if you think that, you'll have just as much trouble in any other role.

DPS, Tank, or support, you're ultimately supporting the team and trying to help them out.

That doesn't mean you should keep playing support. If you like playing other things, play other things! Don't pigeonhole yourself in a single role if you aren't having fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, playing Roadhog is different from playing DPS, because Roadhog is a tank and tanks are often also in short supply. Also, a 3-tank setup is often pretty optimal, and Roadhog, because of his high kill capability, is a solid third tank.

The thing is, being flexible about what you play is important. But it is a good idea to have several characters you can play. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It makes games more interesting. If there is a Bo5 finals, and one team has a single quirky cheesy pocket strat that the other team hasn't seen before, so they don't know how to play as or against it, do you really want to see the same team lose the same matchup 3 times in a row?

Yes, absolutely! If your opponent manages to bring a pocket strategy all the way to the finals, then busts it out, and you can't figure out how to deal with it, then you *deserve* to lose and they *deserve* to win. Anyone who brings a pocket strategy all the way to the finals is someone who is good enough to not have to use it on the way there, and then when they bring it out against you, if you cannot figure out how to deal with something new in the heat of the game, why shouldn't you lose?

That sort of thing is exciting. It is interesting.

If you suck too much to deal with the unexpected, then I hope you lose.

"But I didn't have time to prepare for this!"

Waaaaah! It sounds like someone is bad at the game!

Seriously. That's pure scrub talk. If you can't deal with something that someone else has managed to conceal and then pop out in the finals, then you deserve the loss.

 The audience doesn't want to see three stomps in a row because one team found an unintuitive and powerful ability interaction that no one else ever saw before or practiced with.

This is completely wrong in every way.

People get excited when teams use unusual strategies in order to win. That's what generates buzz and makes people want to watch stuff. When people can pull something out of their back pocket that they haven't seen before, and see something new, that excites people.

People love novelty like this. I see it all the time - when teams pull off unusual or interesting strategies, people are excited by it. People love trick plays in football. They like them in games like Overwatch. Why wouldn't they like them in a MOBA?

If the finals are predictable, what's the point in even watching? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They don't have to tell you to destroy buildings on any other map.

It is amusing to me when people complain about the stupidity of gamers, and how they don't pay attention, and then say shit like this.

Maybe you should try actually listening to the announcer sometime.

The Raven Lord encourages you to attack when your enemy is cursed. In Towers of Doom, the Grave Keeper literally says "Go! Destroy the Raven Lord's towers!" at the start of the battle.

Obviously they need as much landholding as possible, because people like you don't pay attention to shit. If they don't constantly bombard you with information, you'll miss it. That's why you throw it at players via as many routes as possible - visual cues, audio cues, the map design guiding you towards the enemy, the screen at the start listing the objectives, ect.

And really, saying "it is a basic mechanic of the entire genre" when Hanamura is a map where you literally cannot go through the enemy fortifications and attack the enemy core, and instead must play the objectives in order to win because you literally cannot attack the core directly, really kind of misses an important aspect of the map, which is that it is not exactly the same as generic MOBA map #672.

It doesn't help that Towers of Doom, which is a similar "can't attack the core" map, works in a somewhat similar but different way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your argument already fails when you say "anyone who plays the game regularly". The game's mechanics should be immediately obvious in-game to someone the first time they play the map, and it should be reminding players of them constantly to help them keep track of things.

The fact that the announcer does not encourage you to attack the other fortification - in fact, the fact that the map itself doesn't encourage you to do so naturally, because destroying their fortifications doesn't let you attack their core, unlike on most other maps - is a clear design fail.

Why do you think that that the various announcers constantly tell the players to do shit like seize objectives and attack the enemy fort and mocking you for having your own stuff blown up? Why do you think that at the start of the map, the announcers direct you to drive the enemy off the map?

It is something which happens on every map except Hanamura.

The Raven Lord tells you that he will curse you if you don't earn his favor. If you get cursed, after the curse ends, he'll say something about how now you realize the value of the curse, and should do a better job of earning his favor, and if he curses your enemies, he encourages you to attack. This drives players to play the objectives properly.

Braxis has the announcer beg you to funnel the zerg at the enemy so as to avoid them attacking you, is relieved when you funnel more zerg at the enemy and is scared when more zerg are coming at you, and is relieved when the zerg are all dead, indicating that the map is going back to normal.

Hanamura's announcer does not do these things. Why not?

Shitty design. Pure and simple.

The fact that the map doesn't encourage you to attack their fortifications directly because it doesn't allow you to attack their core furthers this issue. On the other map where you cannot attack their core directly, the various forts visually fire on both the map and the minimap whenever you activate an altar, showing you that they are contributing towards your victory (or towards your defeat, as the case may be). This again reinforces the idea that these objectives are important.

You want every part of your design to reinforce the objectives of the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The announcer absolutely should tell you to destroy buildings. Why wouldn't they? There's absolutely no reason whatsoever for them not to tell you to do so.

Moreover, on normal maps, the purpose of destroying the buildings is to fight to the enemy core. But on Hanamura, you cannot attack the enemy core. So what's the point of pushing through their fortifications?

If there was an announcer telling you that you could, say, raid the enemy forts for extra ammunition for the payloads, that would reinforce the map's mechanics in-game.

How much hand-holding do I expect?

Well, given I had to explain this to you, I think that there needs to be quite a bit of hand-holding. Having constant reinforcement of your game's mechanics is really important. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe you should look in a mirror.

Blizzard failed. The map is confusing to people. Part of the problem is that it doesn't function like other, similar maps in the game, which makes it confusing. Part of the problem is that the visual indicator isn't very obvious. Part of the problem is that the announcer doesn't drive you to attack the enemy fort. Heck, there's no obvious gameplay incentive *to* attack the enemy forts in Hanamura beyond denying them their healing fountains. It is very non-obvious that it has an impact on the game, because you cannot attack the enemy core directly, and that's the usual reason for attacking the enemy base. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's pretty much the exact opposite of Blizzard's model. Blizzard encourages people to play every day (as opposed to just randomly playing occasionally), a lot of its games have heavy PvP/competitive focuses (Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, Warcraft, Starcraft - only Diablo and WOW aren't PVP focused, and WOW still has a large PVP component), and a number of its games are pretty complicated (HOTS, Starcraft, Warcraft, and WOW are all quite complex, and Overwatch is more complex than other FPS games).

Blizzard does not really encourage casual play of its games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was using some old quest math, that's how. They've changed the quests since the beta and I didn't remember that.

Present daily quests are:

Play 8 games - 800 gold

Win 3 games - 600 gold

Play 3 games of (insert class) - 300 gold x 4

Play 3 vs. AI games - 300 gold (this is a new quest and I forgot it existed)

Play 2 games as (hero of insert game here) - 200 gold x3

The "Play 3 games as any hero" quest goes away after level 11 so I'm not counting it.

So the average should be 800 + 600 + 300 x 5 + 200 x 3 / 10 = 350 gold/day.

If you do the cheaty thing some people do who play every day (keep two of the 200 gold quests in their quest queue to prevent them from coming up again) you can drive it up to an average of 387.5 gold/day.

I edited my post with the updated math. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is nonsense. Shouting about libertarianism here is stupid. It has nothing to do with libertarianism. Do you think that Flint is a hotbed of libertarianism? Because it isn't.

What is a city?

It is nothing more than a collection of people.

Who pays for everything a city does?

The people who live in that city.

Flint has repeatedly voted in incompetent, shitty politicians. They have repeatedly turned down upgrading their infrastructure. Why?

Because the people of Flint didn't want to pay for it.

Guess what?

If you refuse to pay for shit, and keep voting in shitty politicians who can't keep a budget, your city is going to go bankrupt, and bad shit is going to happen.

This is what happened to Flint. It is the result of democracy, pure and simple. They voted for this. They wanted this problem.

I mean, you can say that they didn't, but if they didn't, why did they vote for shitty politicians? Why did they keep voting down levies to improve the infrastructure? Why did they keep trying to spend more money than they had, driving their city into bankruptcy?

We are a democracy. The government represents the people. The government of Flint represents the people of Flint - dysfunctional, unwilling, and unable to take responsibility for anything. It is always someone else's fault.

Nice stuff doesn't fall like manna from the sky. It has to be paid for. If it is city stuff, that means it gets paid for by city taxes and implemented by people who your politicians hire to get shit done.

If you elect shitty politicians and don't pay taxes for your infrastructure, guess what is going to happen?

Hell is other people.

I mean, I *guess* you could argue that Flint is a libertarian's wet dream, because apparently the people there are very much like a lot of libertarians: they don't want to pay taxes, expect someone else to foot the bill for everything, and nothing is ever their fault.

There's a reason where I live constantly has levies going up on ballots - because people want new stuff. New fire stations, new schools, paying for various county services. The list goes on.

If you vote no on all those ballot measures, guess what? That stuff doesn't get paid for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FYI, the problem isn't that the water is poisoned. The water coming from the city is fine.

The problem is that people live in houses with lead pipes. The pipes had corrosion on their insides which reduced the amount of lead which was getting into their houses. The city water got rid of the corrosion, thereby allowing more of the lead into the water.

The reason why this issue is still ongoing is because the problem is mostly not with the city's pipes, it is with the pipes in people's houses. Almost all of the lead in people's drinking water is coming from the pipes in their own homes.

People who replaced the pipes in their houses with pipes without lead in them are fine and have been fine. Indeed, if you look at the actual measurements in the city, you can see that most houses are fine, some are not, and some have ridiculously high levels of lead. </TEXT>

In six months, that's 365/2*350 = 63,875 gold from daily quests. That's already 138,875. 65 * 9 = level 585, so that's 3,875 gems (including the 1000 for hitting level... 10 I think?). That's 10 50% off 10k heroes, or effectively another 100k, so 238,875.

The Assassins mega bundle gives you 145k gold worth of heroes.

So we're up to 383,875, without even counting gold from games, or some of the other bonuses/sources of free heroes.

If you're playing nothing but vs AI games, that's 10 gold per match without a stimpack, or 25 with a stimpack. It is much more if you're playing quick play.

In either case though, because the stimpack also makes you level faster... well, it is going to work out similarly math wise, though it will be a bit better with stimpacks. It takes 5.25 million xp to get from level 1 to level 10. If we assume that the average vs AI game awards about 60k xp and the average quick play game awards about 100k xp, that's about 52.5 quick play games or 87.5 vs AI games. 52.5 * 65 * 25 gold/game = 85,312.5 gold. 87.5 * 65 * 10 gold/game = 56,875 gold. Note that doing this in half a year requires you to play about 18 quick play games per day, or 31 vs AI games. If we assume you can win vs AI games in about 12 minutes, and quick play games last 20, you're looking at about 6 hours of HOTS per day to do this.

The QPer should have 469,187 gold (the vs AI guy will have somewhat less). This will, of course, be somewhat distorted; stimpacks will get you there in fewer games, as will playing in groups.

So, if you're a real no-lifer and level everyone up to level 10, getting every hero within six months or so is at least plausible, and it would be possible to buy every hero in the game with gold at that point.

All of that is ignoring loot boxes, too. In that time you would have gotten 585 loot boxes from levels, 65 from leveling characters, and 26 from brawls. Realistically speaking, you'll have gotten a number of heroes from those as well, which will drive down the costs of acquiring more heroes. And you will have likely gotten stimpacks as well, which further speeds up xp and gold gains.

So in reality you can probably do it with less than six hours of gameplay per day - if you group up aggressively, I'd guess you'd be able to do it in about four hours a day for six months.

The second half takes a lot longer than the first half, too - getting all heroes to level 5 takes only about a quarter of the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back during the beta, I got 13ish heroes or so. My level was 156 when I logged in for HOTS 2.0.

Gold gains from playing games are quite modest, even with a stimpack (though stimpacks do make them a lot larger, especially in quickplay). 

The real trick is completing daily quests and leveling heroes to level 5 (and 10, 15, 20, ect. but level 5 is the really important one because it is relatively easy to do).

You're a new player, so you've got 20 level 1 heroes (maybe more, depending on what promotional stuff you've got from Legacy of the Void/Overwatch, as well as being recruited, and I think there's an additional hero awarded at level 10?)

But let's just think about that. If you level all 20 of those heroes to level 5, you'll be level 80. You'll have gotten 20*500 = 10,000 gold. You get 444 gold per day on average from daily quests. If it takes you, say, three weeks to level all those heroes to level 5, that's another 21 * 444 = 9324 gold. If you're playing vs AI, that's 10 gold per game on top of that.

That's enough gold for at least two 10k heroes, or 3 7k heroes, or... well, a number of combinations of cheaper ones.

Moreover, you can also play the free to play heroes (which change every week) and level them to level 5 as well.

Back during the beta, I leveled every hero to level 5 except for Abathur, because he never came up in the free hero rotation.

Also, you get random heroes from lootboxes as well, which is new.

If you are reasonably cunning about wringing out gold from the system, you should be able to get quite a lot.

It does diminish a bit after a while - once you've leveled every hero to level 5, gold becomes a bit harder to come by - but by then you should have a pretty healthy collection of heroes.

Also the free gems every 25 levels and the 1000 gems you get for... level 10 I think? - make a big difference. By level 25 you should have 1125 gems, which, if you wait for the heroes to go on 50% off sales, means you can acquire about three 10k gold heroes for that, as they're 375 gems when on sale (750 normally).

I'm presently at 1125 gems, about 14k gold, and 34/65 heroes. So in principle, I could buy at least four more 10k heroes and be at 38/65. In practice, I'm going to have to wait for sales, and I have no idea what heroes I don't have I want to buy.

If you play basically the minimum to complete your daily quests vs AI only, with no stimpacks, you'll get somewhat north of 10k gold every three weeks or so, ignoring bonuses from levelling heroes to multiples of 5 and suchlike. That's about enough to keep the same amount "behind" (as they release a new hero about every three weeks or so).

Between everything else - loot box hero drops, leveling heroes to level 5, 10, 15, ect., and gems for every 25 levels - you should gradually catch up to the total hero pool.

You can totally play HOTS without paying one red cent, but the game is designed such that it would take a long time to get everything in it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't really help that there's other AC-esque games as well.

 They need to do something drastically different like they did with Black Flag if they want people to care about Assassin's Creed again. I'm actually kind of worried that it's apparently more naval combat and not something different.

I agree. They need to do something more.

Honestly, that's why I thought that they were building up to the modern day; it would allow them to go with more advanced devices and mix up the combat more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Assassin's Creed 2 was the best game in the series. Not from a mechanical point of view, but from the point of view of coherency.

It all hung together well, and didn't just feel like "I'm doing a bunch of random stuff because history says so", but like you're looking at the story of Ezio, but you're also simultaneously looking at a broader conspiracy story. The various puzzles about historical conspiracies, the secret stuff from the previous guy in the Animus, the underlying theme of the game sort of tying into figuring out what is going on combining with Ezio's theme of trying to get to the bottom of the Templars, and of course the ending were all pretty great.

The problem was that they couldn't pull it off again, and the conspiracy stuff sort of faded to the background. They also did two more AC2 games, and then moved on to other assassins at other points, as well as sort of discarding the central story of the game in a very unsatisfying way.

It felt like it was building up to doing modern day assassining in service to a greater plot, but the modern day stuff in AC3 just wasn't that interesting (and AC3 in general was kind of a disaster - gigantic but pointless). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh, there's lots of other good setups. Ana's ult is something that can just be used at will, Zenyatta adds a lot of extra damage.  You can easily replace Torb with almost any other DPS hero or even a tank, though some heroes (Pharah) are rather bad. Orisa and Zarya's abilities are both pretty handy, and D. Va can also shove the detonators away. Roadhog can also hook away the detonators, and his heavy damage isn't to be underestimated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you already have everything, then you have nothing to do with any gold you accumulate but spend it on heroes (and rerolls, I guess, but given you seem not to be interested in loot chests, let's ignore those).

Given you earn ~444 gold/day off of quests on average, over 21 days, that's 9324 gold on average. Even if you're just playing vs AI, you get 10 gold per game. Three games per day on average, times 21 days, is another 630 gold. That puts you at 9954 gold.

Given you have 21 first win of the day bonuses in there, that should put you at just over 10,000 gold every three weeks.

And given you get a new hero, you can easily level them up to level 5 for another 500 gold...

Really, it seems like you should be able to keep ahead of the curve and gradually accumulate gold in the long run, even playing a relatively modest number of games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The other thing is that if you wait for heroes to go on sale for 50% off, you can buy a 750 gem hero for 375 gems.

Right now I'm sitting on 13k gold and 1000 gems with over half the cast. I played during the beta, then just came back, and between what I had at the beta, plus what I've gotten recently (I've gone from 156 to 179 in the last couple days because of all my new low-level heroes) I've gotten three heroes in chests. On top of the 13 I already had, plus a promo hero from Overwatch Origins Edition, I'm sitting at close to 40 heroes. Once I hit level 200, I'll have enough gems to buy three on-sale 10k gold/750 gem heroes, and I've already got enough gold to buy another 10k hero (or, say, a 7k and a 4k hero).

The fact that you sometimes get heroes in chests is not to be underestimated; it makes levelling much more valuable, as every chest has a chance of a hero. A hero is worth quite a lot; I've gotten three 7k heroes from loot boxes. That's 21k gold, effectively.

If you do some calculation, the new system is generally more generous than the old one, especially for a new player. </TEXT>

Stealth isn't a common trait and is extremely powerful; acting like it isn't a trait because a few people have it is silly, and making a cloaked specialist is dangerous ground - part of the danger of specialists is that they're really good at wave clearing and taking down towers and such, and making one who is cloaked would be extremely strong. She already has bribe as a talent if you want to spec her along the lines of a jungler.

	<TEXT>  Dude LMAO. How can you both acknowledge that spy agencies exist yet fully believe the official story of the much lower level police agency?

These two statements have absolutely no relationship with each other whatsoever.

Spy agencies existing is totally irrelevant. The question is "What happened to this person?"

There was no evidence of anyone else at the scene.

There was considerable evidence that the person in question had a history of self-bondage, and had on at least one other occasion tied himself up in such a way that they couldn't escape and had to call for help.

Which is more likely - a murder which left *absolutely no evidence whatsoever*, or an accidental death which was in line with the person's past behavior?

Spy agencies aren't full of fairies who leave no evidence of their existence.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She got third degree burns from spilling hot liquid all over herself because she pried the lid off a coffee cup she put in her lap to try and pour cream into it while she was sitting in the car.

This is like spilling fresh-cooked ramen soup on yourself and suing Top Ramen because you boiled the noodles. Would Top Ramen be liable for that?

Obviously not. So why would McDonalds be?

Coffee is brewed between 195 and 205 F (or 91-96 C). That's how it is produced. This means fresh coffee is going to be very hot indeed. Moreover, because the flavor profile of coffee changes over time, they have to maintain brewed coffee at a high temperature to prevent such degredation - maintaining coffee at lower temperatures changes its flavor and makes it taste bad to most people.

That's what coffee is. Arguing "It is your fault" is pure, sheer nonsense. The reality is that hot liquids are dangerous to spill on yourself.

If McDonalds had fumbled the coffee and dumped it into her lap in the drive-through, yeah, that'd be a legitimate lawsuit.

But the reality is that they served it to her in a closed-top cup, and she pried the top off the cup while holding the cup in her lap in her car.

The reality is that the Liebuck jury was just shitty. You get shitty juries periodically. Other juries have decided the opposite, and numerous industry groups called it ridiculous, and have successfully won using that stance in court.

"But she got third degree burns!" is irrelevant. Indeed, IRL, [you can get third-degree burns from *140* F water in about five seconds](http://www.burnfoundation.org/programs/resource.cfm?c=1 a=3). And you can not be harmed at all by boiling water.

The issue has to do with heat, not temeprature. Water can hold a huge amount of heat. A few spots of water getting on your skin isn't likely to harm you, even if the water is boiling; conversely, full body immersion in 140 F water will kill you very, very quickly.

And yet, people drink coffee all the time without injury, despite the fact that most people drink their coffee at temperatures of 140F or more.

Coffee is dangerous if you spill it on yourself. The thickness of the cup has nothing to do with it - the cause of the spill was pulling the lid off the top while pressing the cup between her legs. Of course that resulted in a spill.

But that doesn't mean that people who serve coffee should be liable if their customers spill it on themselves.

If it is the fault of the company for the spill - if they fumbled the drink onto a customer, or if their cup was shoddily manufactured - then yeah, that'd be a source of legitimate liability. But that wasn't the case here. The cup worked fine. The defect was in the customer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, if you're going to try and be condescending, you might at least try to be correct.

Imagine, for a moment, that you are an adult. You don't have any kids, and you own your own house. How many of those things are relevant?

You don't have any kids, so tuition and childcare are gone. You own your house, so rent is out.

Utilities make up only a tiny proportion of your budget.

So, uh, what are you paying more for? Food? Food budgets have shrunk relative to total income over time.

Inflation is an attempt at capturing the changing prices of various goods and services.

But the problem is that a lot of goods and services haven't changed much in price for a while. It varies, of course; wages have gone up over time, which is a major cause of inflation (you have to pay people more per hour now on average than you did in 2007), and not all jobs have become more productive (or at least, not as much more productive as the wages), so the prices of goods from those folks has increased relative to inflation.

However, a lot of other prices have remained extremely stagnant.

There is some inflation, obviously. But the reality is that people are better off in terms of material goods today than they were in 2007. This means that their wealth has increased, which means that inflation must have been below compensation growth.

The perception of inflation will vary quite a bit depending on particular circumstances and locale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why would you expect it to be there?

It is quite hard to get DNA evidence. It requires you to get lucky, more or less. This is why rape kits are important; DNA can degrade rapidly in the environment, especially warm, wet places (like, you know, a bathtub).

Getting DNA evidence requires them to find recoverable DNA. The problem is that, as noted, DNA degrades rapidly; the larger the sample, the more likely you are to find DNA. If you get, say, a lot of blood or semen or a body part, statistics are more in your favor - there's a lot more cells there, so there's a lot more opportunity to find DNA. The fewer cells, the less likely you are to find usable DNA.

The only thing you're likely to find on the side of the tub or the outside of the bag is skin cells, but the environmental conditions aren't great for it. A tub is a smooth, slick surface; it doesn't really hold stuff very well. And unless he spent a long period of time in contact with either, there's a good chance you just won't find enough intact cells a week later to get any sort of result.

DNA evidence is reliable *if you can find it*, but the problem is that collecting DNA evidence isn't really very easy. In a lot of cases, you won't find it because it just isn't there anymore, especially not a week or more later. Someone's clothing, sure, they spend a lot of time in contact with that.

But a random object they only touched briefly?

You'd have to be really lucky.

On top of that, if you dust for fingerprints, you destroy DNA evidence. As such, anywhere you test for fingerprints, you can't do a DNA test on, and anything you rub clean in order to try and pick up any DNA off of it, you're destroying the fingerprint evidence. The two methods are mutually exclusive. </TEXT>
