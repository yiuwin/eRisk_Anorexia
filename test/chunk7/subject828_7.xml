	<TEXT> Don't forget to use the terrain to your advantage. Set up units for flanking bonuses. Units stationed inside cities and encampments don't take damage, the district does. Forts give big heal and defense bonus. Fortifying units gives good defense bonus too. Let them come to you and break upon your wall. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem I have with that is when after doing the cgb your charge is now stopped and all that stam is wasted. Yeah it's cool to spin the flail but it isn't very useful once you figure out it's glaring weakness. I'm thinking if the speed was upped you could use that to punish the gb in the face or mix up and confuse others with the strange timing. Maybe even have a followup heavy go fast too. He needs some options man! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doesn't work versus anyone who knows how it works. They don't attack first so you can't get that big pseudo parry off. Just run in and GB the charging conq. Having cgb would be nice but it still isn't going to hit someone paying attention. Only time I get some use any more is after an out of stamina throw then half charge hits them on the ground. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Conqueror Charged Heavy Change </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So as many people know, the charged heavy is very rarely used on Conqueror. Reasons being it uses lots of stamina, is very telegraphed and easy to block or parry, and leaves you vulnerable to an uncounterable guard break. That's not very good for the trademark "Hard Hitting" move.

I propose that as the heavy attack charge level increases, it not only does higher damage on hit but also has faster attack speed. I feel this would work better than making it unblockable plus it makes sense from a logical point of view as well.

For instance, the heavy has 3 levels right? Normal, half charge, and full charge. Normal is as is. On half charge the attack would swing come out 33% faster, and full charge 50%. I'm not a numbers guy those are just rough ideas.

Let's get this upvoted so our beloved basher smasher gets some attention! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like your ideas. I'd thought about why the Shug doesn't have more wrestling type executions instead of these silly ones.

I think a good one for Raider would be if he just choked out the victim with his axe shaft.

Lawbringer needs a literal execution type one where he says in latin, "The sentence is death!" as he forces them on their hands and knees for the beheading swing. </TEXT>
