	<TEXT> Since starting research on the Dreadnought class, I started wondering what type of ship you all prefer. Small missile cruisers, like what are in use today irl, or WWII era Battleships, or anything in between. I want to know what you like! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Isn't that meant for Missiles? This doesn't use missiles, but is a rail gun, and shoots bullet-like projectiles. If i'm wrong, correct me, but I believe my point still stands. </TEXT>

While your input is greatly appreciated, I see no further use in this discussion, as neither of us will be able to convince the other to change their views. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [m] I just really like battleships  
Your concerns are understandable, but i must refer to one of my original reasons for the construction of this battleship: There's virtually no defense against ballistic projectiles except to move out of the way, which can be difficult with high speed ammunition, like that shot by a rail gun. Even though this ship has guns that can shoot 300 nm, it will be designed to close to knife-fight range if possible to weaken the capability to launch missile against it and to annihilate enemy Ships. </TEXT>
