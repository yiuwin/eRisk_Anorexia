	<TEXT> Yeah I was like this when I was 12. Then I learned I wasn't as cool as I thought I was. You sound like you're trying really hard to be edgy, honestly. I'm calling bullshit on this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey excuse poor formatting, I'm on mobile and still relatively new to coming out of lurking. Anyway, I'm a vegetarian and I'm going to an Asian restaurant soon. It's just your typical Americanized Asian restaurant, they have vegetarian sushi rolls, steamed rice, different types of soups and salads, and steamed veggies so I think I'm going to stick to that stuff. What is your go to when ordering at Americanized Asian restaurants? Do you have any tips? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spending money is weird for me I tend to waste money spontaneously on frivolous shit and when it comes to items I need Im stingy as hell. I'll go from religiously researching books, clothing material, nutrition facts, and games/gaming consoles one day before making the cheapest selection possible to blowing all my money on bullshit the next day. Depends on my mood. As for me, other than getting a job, prostitution, and modeling I can't think of a way for me to make money that I'm not too lazy for so I have no ideas for you... Get a job if you can, though! The academy I go to doesn't permit me, and it sucks. So if you get the opportunity you should take it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel this. If you think I won't go out of my way to go to the grocery store that carries a lower calorie version of puffed wheat cereal you are absolutely wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah; I think typically ENTPs are not very opinionated in an angry and passionate way at least from my experience. There isn't a lot of emotion tied to our arguments like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry but she really sounds nothing like an ENTP. Are you sure about your typing?
Anyway it sucks that you're in such a situation. You have no responsibility towards her and her feelings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! One of them actually got hostile towards my friend who has had issues with eating and started attempting to report her blog for advocating eating disorders. She got very hostile towards my friend and was so condescending.
I always see positivity posts on tumblr saying things like "Remember to eat today!" "If you need a sign to eat today this is it" "Take care of yourself you deserve to eat" and those posts piss me off soooo much that I skip meals out of spite... I don't know why, those posts just feel so condescending so I always feel very "Fuck you. You don't control me. I won't eat and don't pity me for it." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was a joke on tumblr. You can't take pages that repost shit from tumblr seriously. They're worse than tumblr. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Durarara!! is my favorite anime. If you think it's cheesy, read the novel--it's way worse, but I love it. If you've seen the newer season with the twins, I personally like them a lot better than Izaya (who is a perfect example of an ENTP to me, even though some people swear he's an INTJ). Though honestly I really enjoy almost all the characters and find them to be pretty unique, but to each their own I guess!
Edit: Oh wait I've just now seen where you said you only saw the first season whoops. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went from 125 to 105 and ballooned back up to 120lb. I saw myself the same when I got to 105lb, though now that I've gained I feel disgusting and much fatter than I did at 125.  </TEXT>
