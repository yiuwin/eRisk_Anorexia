	<TEXT> nail polish has never helped. My nail biting is so unconscious now, i honestly have no freakin clue when im doing it. My fiance calls me out when he catches me doing it, but if he's not around, i will mindlessly bite my nails as im watching a movie, working, etc etc. It's not even a nervous tick thing its like a...all the time thing!!! Ill bite right through that polish without a care in the world haha. But maybe getting regular manicures might help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been a nail biter for yeaars. (about 24, to be exact). So, my nails are always squat and to the tip of the skin, never long. They look kind of crappy. Did you guys do fake nails? Did they stay on? It feels almost weird to me to do because... no one has ever seen me with nails. But, i dont want my hands to look meh in photos. So did you guys do anything, or plan on doing anything? or did you say F it and rock your bitten nails as always? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am in the literal same boat. Started heavy lifting mid November. 5'2, 115 at start. about 118 now. I feel much stronger, for sure,but i don't see anything, other than bigger thighs. (bigger...but not necessarily cut). I think my biggest issue is that i still like my beers (empty carbs/calories) and fiance likes to out to eat once a week (and HE's the one who got me into lifting! somehow he looks better than me despite def having a worse overall diet haha).  While i do stick to the right amount of calories i think HOW im getting my calories can definitely improve, so thats where im working. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup we are also using ours for our save the dates, which I need to go out like...ASAP! So we only just booked a photographer a couple of weeks ago (We got engaged a month ago, short engagement!) but a friend of mine who is a photographer wanted to do our engagement shoot as a gift for us (i didnt want him to do the actual wedding because i want him there as a guest, not working!). So as you can imagine, setting it up was a lot easier instead of having to book through our photographer. Plus, that 2 hours that our photog would have used to the shoot is now going to the wedding so we have more hours of shooting the day of the event, so it's a win/win! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bought New Laptop, Windows 10 update broke Trackpad Driver </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-22 18:32:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So frustrated. Just bought a new Asus laptop for freelance work; my current desktop I built and has 8.1 so im used to that. This new laptop obviously comes with 10. It goes through the set up, my mouse works fine, then it does a large update that kills the trackpad. Turns out it's a driver issue; tried updating driver, doesnt fix. Tried troubleshoot, and all that did then was make a once useable USB mouse unusable too! Tried completely reinstalling windows 10 since it was a brand new laptop, that didn't work either. Can't even see the pointer of the mouse let alone use it. So i thought maybe it was a fluke with my hardware and am doing an exchange with Amazon and sure enough, past 2-3 days, reviews have cropped up saying they are all having the same issue! The laptop is a ASUS F556UA-AB54. Here's the [amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M08DL26/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1)  so you can see the reviews having the same issue. I'm wondering if I'm just fucked until Microsoft fixes this issue, or if i should try to start up my new laptop without an update (can I even do that?) or just... I don't know. Exchange again for a total different laptop. First experience ever with Windows 10 and I'm already pissed! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He makes me laugh, no matter what. He's absolutely absurd sometimes, and even if I peg it as "annoying", eventually it just makes me giggle. He's supportive of all my endeavors. I just quit my full time job to go freelance which is terrifying! But he supported it 100%. And then asked me to marry him after the fact! ha! So i guess he really is OK with it ;) he has shown me commitment to our relationship even early on by squashing some sort of destructive habits  because he wanted US more than he wanted to continue said habits, and that meant a ton to me. He's really good with kids. He's incredibly intelligent, especially when it comes to politics, world news and history, in a way im just not. It used to intimidate me but now I just appreciate it a ton and learn from him. He's crazy outgoing. We compliment each other well in that he's a procrastinator and has the worst memory ever, and I'm an OCD do-er and remember EVERYTHING. I'm his walking calendar/scheduler that keeps him together, but he reminds me when it's ok to throw caution to the wind and be spontaneous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am going through the same thing. My mom passed away 10 years ago, when I was 20. I went wedding dress shopping with my FMIL, because she's only ever had sons, and im lucky to really get along with her. But i am going for round 2 of shopping with my MOH and another bridesmaid in 2 weeks; I'd rather have SOMEONE with me instead of do it alone. As for the actual wedding, we are having a memorial table for a few people, including her. I will also be dancing with my brother to "California Dreamin" in honor of her, as The Mamas and The Papas were a huge favorite of hers, we used to listen to that album on vinyl growing up. Unsure on anything else, possibly a charm with her photo on my bouquet. It is really tough; Im right there with you. Its such a bittersweet thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad and I have always had a light hearted, fun relationship... never a sappy "daddys girl" sort of one. So a slow dance to some sappy song does NOT feel like us. Instead, I want to learn how to dance the hustle (which he danced with my mom a lot back in the day, she passed 10 years ago). So, i want our dance together to be to Born To Be Alive, which was a song i have fond memories of us singing in the car together when i was little. Disco all the way! Im not telling anyone save for a couple of close friends. </TEXT>

I do agree, talk it out with your dad. tell him what you said and why you said it (Because you were frustrated) and that it wasn't truly you uninviting her, but you were frustrated that she wasnt understanding that you couldn't break your plans for her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is intense. Not just one issue, but multiple. It sounds VERY vindictive and intentional, not like an "oops we insulted them but didn't mean to" situation.

	<TEXT> Wow then i guess we're doing ok! For us the 20k includes cocktail hour, dinner, staff, rentals, and bar (though my fiance's dad has a wine store, so he is providing wine   champagne and the vendor would provide liquor, mixers, beer which cut costs for us there). No wedding cake included, and dinner is 2 courses so if we'd want to do anything else obviously thatd be more. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Manhattan Brides (or Grooms).. Real Talk, How Much Did Catering Cost? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-13 21:20:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To all those who got married in Manhattan, or NYC area in general, how much did catering cost? I am a little shocked at some of the prices im being given (like, 20k after tax and all is said and done, for 120 people) but a friend of mine got married at the W in union square last year and was like "yup, cost us about 23-25k, you're on par for manhattan."

Mind you, my venue does not provide their own catering, they are just literally an event space, so this is all coming from outside vendors.

Is this insane, or is this just typical for manhattan and it is what it is?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I see all of this advice everywhere thats like, make sure you wear the undergarments you are going to wear at your wedding when you go dress shopping (ie spanx etc). Like... i have no idea what im GOING to need to wear until i pick a dress style! I also literally own one pair of spanx shorts... the end. I feel like if i just wear a strapless bra and panties im doing something wrong... did you guys bring like, all the undergarments you'd expect to wear? Did it not matter? I understand it for actual fitting appointments... but why do i need it for just finding the dress? I am going Saturday and feel like im going to be underprepared, or is the advice just nonsense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are in a similar boat, engaged 3 weeks ago, getting married this fall. We are moving quickly on the major vendor things (have our venue, date, photographer, and officiant already locked down! caterers next!) because you really do need to jump on it if you are doing only a 9-10 month engagement. Even if you are doing winter 2018, thats still less than a year out. Id get ahead on anything you can thats major, so that you can relax a little later on and focus on the smaller details! </TEXT>

Is it a slow turn around time? Any customer service issues? Just trying to figure it all out before i send them to this site! </TEXT>
