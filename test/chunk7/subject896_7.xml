	<TEXT> I am the photographer as well as Codex from the Guild and female Captain Malcolm Reynolds from Firefly in this album.

I tried to label all of the costumes (unlike most other cosplay albums) so if I missed one, please feel free to let me know who they are! Thanks and I hope this community enjoys the album as much as I enjoyed putting it together.

	<TEXT> This happened to me on a flight going from Detroit to Dallas. I was only 14 and I had never heard of them refusing to sit next to women before, so I was a little shocked. After being horribly insulted by a stranger who refused to sit next to me because of my gender, I decided to not raise hell about it and just find another seat so we could get the flight off the ground and on our way. 

Unfortunately it was a full flight and I had to wait for someone to volunteer their seat. Once that happened the Jewish man didn't even look at me. He didn't even thank me for respecting his beliefs even though it was insulting and inconvenient for everyone on the plane. I have never been so pissed at someone in my life. Looking back, I should have said, "Too bad. You don't like it? Get off the plane." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've said it before and I'll say it again. She doesn't have hair! This annoys the ever-loving crap out of me. Other than that, it's excellent. But that's why this [one](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/26100000/A-Song-of-Ice-and-Fire-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-26138644-612-612.jpg) will always be my favorite.

	<TEXT> You didn't break it to me. I was aware that Big Oil   Gas weren't listening to the 'little guys'. I just hope the ban proved that we're not 'little guys' anymore and it would be in everyone's best interest to finally open some discourse between sides.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This whole ban is going to be one hot mess. I have a feeling the ban will be overturned in the next stage. We just needed to open a discourse with the "other side" so we can all get what we want. The oil/gas companies want their oil/gas, Texas wants their money, and Denton residents don't want to suffer health concerns/problems from the extraction of gas/oil. Seems like there is enough pie to go around that would satisfy everyone, we just need it to suit all sides, not just 1 or 2. Here's hoping!

	<TEXT> I thought that was fairly obvious. Then again, I am a 30 yr old with a record player. I thought it was also a nice quiet send off during the credits. Most shows tend to go silent when a major character meets their end, so I really enjoyed the sound of the phonograph ending. Simple. Beautiful. And well honored.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The teeth were a bit much at times. I thought he looked a little vampiric at first. But every so often, the facial expression, the voice, the teeth would all line up to make for an extremely convincing young Nucky. I've really enjoyed this part of the last season. I wish we had had a glimpse into young Nucky's life before now. Now, there's just so little time left. </TEXT>
