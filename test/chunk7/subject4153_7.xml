	<TEXT> It's a common criticism of the Lovecraft games, but how in the world would you ever make a game more true to the stories? What kind of satisfying game system could you create about people writing letters about being driven mad by indescribable horrors? Where the protagonist should almost always "lose", or at the most not die.

I don't really see a really fun, more authentic approach that inexplicably remains untapped. So I don't really mind the pulpy approach with more of a Lovecraft veneer. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any cases that offer camera protection? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-02 18:44:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> And when I say protection, I mean fully covered and not just a bumper/lip around a cutout in the case. The phone took a tumble and the camera glass broke. I was able to remove the broken glass and the lens is perfectly fine, but it's exposed to the elements and I'm not gonna just stick it in my pocket and carry it around like that. For now, I just have some tape over the cutout while I try to find a case...a solution to my problem I thought would be serviceable and easy enough.

But I've had a hard time finding such a case. I don't like the added heft of any cases so ideally I'd find a nice slim one, but I can't even come across any bulkier otterbox style cases. Are there any such cases out there?

The only other possibility seems to be replacing the entire camera assembly, which I'm not too scared to do, but the price for it is around ~$50 and at that much I'd almost just rather wait and put that money towards my next phone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say it's a steal at the current price. It takes some getting used to, it certainly isn't as snappy as playing with with real cards and figures with your fingers, but that training is a small price to pay for access to hundreds of games that you can play with people all over the world and easily set up and "leave up" indefinitely. Just being able to solo play games and save them without having to worry about clearing a table for dinner or watching out for cat mischief is wonderful for me. There are good and bad quality mods in the workshop, but if it's a very mainstream game, chances are better than not that there will be several versions with one being an attempt at an ultimate copy with good looking art and well laid out components.

Making your own game is not very hard at all, especially now compared to like a year or more ago. It can be time consuming and tedious depending on the game, but not difficult. When I first started making my own games, there were no custom dice or tokens, I had to make my own proper 3D models and get them imported with my own textures just for something as simple as a round counter. And Tabletop Simulator could be a little picky about what it would accept, so there was some hair pulling to get something so basic working right. But now, custom dice and tokens and tiles(in addition to game boards and cards which were there previously) are built into the game and you don't have to provide anything but the images. 

Check [the knowledge base at the official site](http://berserk-games.com/knowledgebase_category/custom-content/) for good tutorials on getting started with custom pieces, it'll do much better than I could briefly do here. But basically, unless your game has pieces more complex and unique than cards, flat counters, dice, tiles and standees, all you'll need to do is scan or find images of the pieces and import them Tabletop Simulator and it'll do that heavy lifting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My biggest criticism would be the usability of the cards. I can definitely understand and appreciate not wanting to obscure good artwork, but at the end of the day it's a game foremost and it should work with good iconography and no art whatsoever. You don't want to go completely the opposite way and sacrifice all the flavor art provides just to have simple, huge functional icons, just need to find a good balance between playability and prettiness. All the game info seems quite separated from the artwork like the information is even referencing what's in the illustrations. Not being afraid to overlap things and have the pertinent info interact with the art would be a good thing. Having everything pushed up against "the walls" and forcing eyes to travel all the way across the card face(which, while cool, provides nothing useful for your gameplay) isn't very user friendly. On first glance, with some text orienting both in portrait and landscape format, I can't tell what the most important elements are and if there's any order I should be processing all the bits.

The longer lines of text are so small I imagine it would be nigh unreadable at any distance beyond holding in your hand. And even then, the high contrast and kerning makes it still a bit of a challenge to quickly absorb the information at even a few inches away. Your eyes kinda vibrate at the stark black and white. 

The icons are needlessly scrunched up together. There's that whole length of the card devoted to those icons and more than half that space is empty and not doing anything. So there's not much reason against spreading the icons some so they are easier to pick out individually and don't become one big blob. 

For contrast, [here's a card that I really enjoy the graphic design of](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic862701.jpg). Your eye naturally immediately goes to the top left and begins processing info. Each stat is distinct and can be picked out in a millisecond. The various stats are formatted in unique ways to separate them into pertinent, useful chunks so they don't all become an amorphous cloud of icons and numbers. The art takes up only around half the total real estate of the card and is intertwined with the graphic design. The text is pretty small in places on this card, but the solid colored, thin font weight on the soft background makes it very pleasant to read.  

I hope that's some helpful food for thought, your cards aren't bad. They're functional enough, I like the design of the icons themselves, I think they are very intuitive without knowing anything about the game. And the LOTR cards aren't the end all, be all...but they seem to be conveying similar levels and types of information as your cards and I think a lot can be gleaned from studying their layout.

I hate this "defense" so much, trying to turn any criticism back onto people and turning them into babies. It's not even remotely about instant gratification.

It's either totally failing to grasp those concepts, or throwing any competence to the wind in favor of hacky, cheap gimmicks to hold your audience by the balls and try to force them to come back next season rather than making them *want* to come back.

Typically when I get a new game before I finished reading the rules, I'm measuring and starting to put something together in SketchUp. Like MNRomanova touched on, sometimes this can be a bit of a challenge if I don't really understand how to play the game fully and how components are used or not used..but usually it's easy enough to figure it out close enough.

My projects right now are Dawn of the Zeds(easy, the box will end up only being about two-thirds full) and Zombicide: Black Plague(trickier, it's going to be packed to the millimeter to get everything organized and back in the box). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just worry it's the kind of idea that might not drive a large majority of collectors wild. Like more of a passion project than something they expect to catch on and last. At least they save on licensing, that's gotta help potential longevity.

I'm glad they rather early on made the Vitruvian Man and didn't feel locked into just making statues. Moving into illustrations and paintings will really widen the possibilities. </TEXT>

Almost every feature will have fans and folks not as interested, and every feature being worked on will compromise at least to some degree work that can be done in another area.

	<TEXT> Thanks, I was going to ask when I came to the comments. You're work is absolutely stunning. Pieces similar to Cleopatra have such great loose brush work and great energy and don't feel over done, but the much tighter paintings like Putin or Mayweather v. Pacquiao still don't feel too overworked to "killing" them. That's often my problem, I strive too much for hyperrealism and then the paintings end up feeling a bit lifeless and sterile.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool, thanks. I haven't touched Corel Painter in a couple years but it was always great fun to play around with, it really felt like you were slopping real paint around a canvas. I've come across Kyle Webster's brushes before but hadn't jumped on them yet as it's been hard for me to justify when there are so many free brushes out there. And I don't want to let myself get into the mindset that the secret to great painting is finding the right "magical brush" that does all the work for you. That's a pipedream I've let my self fall for too many times.

But. That said. With it on my mind, I downloaded some of Kyle's free brushes and they are very impressive and you can tell a lot of work went into them and they do truly seem more worthwhile than most free brushes and worth a few bucks.

	<TEXT> It's not just about Oswald being in Russia. He'd have to wait three/five years because the rabbit hole always drops him years before the assassination and he can't be entirely positive of who pulled the trigger practically until that day. So kill Oswald asap and go back to 2016, Kennedy still died in Dallas and so he has to go back. Unless he keeps returning, killing likely candidates and checking the result until he gets lucky, he still ends up doing a lot of waiting and research and surveillance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm with you on these points. The yellow card man was one of the most intriguing and King-ian ideas in how he approached a time travel story. It was disappointing to see it changed so significantly. 

And I couldn't believe how little they dug into the living Kennedy timeline and how it ended up the way it did. When I first read the ending I thought it was a bit over the top to the point of comical in how dystopian it was, but I loved the idea that the universe as it had unfolded is the best possible timeline. No matter how bad some events appeared, in the grand scheme they were necessary to prevent even worse things. Maybe the writers felt like I did at first, that it might have come across silly and unbelievable, but if that were the case and they didn't want to dive into the whole story, they didn't really have to make it look like The Road and leave us teased and in the dark. Jake couldn't even be bothered to ask what "the bombings" in the 70s were about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could see them doing a unique spin on Psycho, kinda like how Hannibal hit the broad points from the books but also put a lot of things in a blender and reassembled the overall narrative. But I don't see them flat out retreading things, though it could still be neat. If they do try to come full circle and run the story up to the movie timeframe, I'm picturing the final scene being Marion Crane walking in to check in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One significant change I think is in the book, this moment happens while Clay is outside, in line for ice cream. A couple people in front of him are hit and act strange. In the distance, screams are heard in a park and people are being attacked. And then there are some car wrecks...And it builds from there. Putting it in a crammed airport allows no room for this moment to breath, growing confusion and dread is replaced by generic instant action movie reaction. It appears to be a much more cliche approach to handling this idea.

But I imagine you're right, that it probably was changed due to pacing and that it just looks better on a movie screen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not the normal people reacting to the phoners or the madness around them, the way the phoners themselves react once hit by the Pulse. In the book it was a much smaller initial event that over the course of several minutes slowly escalated into chaotic terror. 

It might seem like nitpicking, but that whole first scene is one of my favorite Stephen King bits of writing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And the scene they chose to show unfolds fairly differently than the book. That's the point. Based on seeing the people's immediate reactions, I don't expect to see something as low-key and creepy and disconcerting as Pixie Dark saying, "Who are you!? Who am I??"

I thought it was a bit much too, by the time John Cusack is trying to outrun crashing planes it felt like a Roland Emmerich movie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, to take it maybe to a ridiculous extent of the argument, if there weren't **any** "rules" and standardization we'd all be baby babbling in our own languages that were understood maybe by all of our immediate family. Or pulling that punch a little bit, shouldn't we be taught not to say pasgetti? And not let it go just because everyone understands what is meant. Language changes, certainly. But it can't be entirely fluid and undefined or it wouldn't be functional. Is it wrong to think of language as a part of the social contracts we all learn and tend to abide by to get along with everyone? I'd be comfortable in my boxers, but it doesn't mean I expect that to go over well when I'm walking around the mall.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting to know about wasp, horse, bird...I never knew they were newer spellings. How is comfortable pronounced differently? That's one I have never heard said any other way. 

Maybe this is a whole other big can of worms to get into...but what exactly is the difference in the more egregious examples of "ebonics" or the stereotypical southern dialects and just saying something wrong repeatedly because you don't know any better? Every example in this thread would basically fall under the latter. People don't say "intensive purposes" just because they're poor. It all stems from a lack of knowledge or willful ignorance in some capacity and I've never thought that was much of a defense. If I don't know how to pronounce a word and make something up, or if I do and just don't care and would rather keep on keeping on...I'm not right. When does a mispronunciation warrant a new remark in the dictionary and when is it supposed to be corrected?

Maybe it's coming from me growing up in West Virginia and really despising any aspect of "embracing ignorance as tradition or historical pride" that you can find in some poorer/rural states. Where a lot of people will try to make writin' and readin' seem like something for high-falutin' pansies. I made a conscious effort to not let my self slip into that mindset, I never said "ain't" or "crick" or "holler" because I saw no value in knowingly speaking in a way that did me no favors. At the very best it's something that can be shrugged off, "Ah, it's just a regional dialect", it's nothing to be proud of.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe I'm being too much of a stickler...I guess, maybe it's that no one looking at the word ASK written for the first time and a normal, predictable assumption would be that the K would be pronounced first. That seems like insanity. It seems like a corruption, just like saying aminal or psaghetti would be criticized and taught against. Where the other examples vary in pronunciation in much more subtle ways. But...I guess no one would see Wednesday for the first time and guess that around most of the world the D is usually not hit first. And iron is a fairly good example, I can get behind that one...I hadn't really stepped back and thought about that one before. But, me being defensive, the vowel pronunciation in a lot of words do seem a lot slipperier. Potato/potawto is something we're more accepting of than potato/topato. 

And this was news to me on aks being an old English pronunciation, that's a really interesting tidbit to learn and makes me go softer on my stance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those, personally, don't feel quite the same. Pretty/purty might be the closest, but I can't see a lot of people, Americans at least...not sure how it might pop up in other English speaking countries, defending purty at all and not hearing it as uneducated sounding. Plenty of pronunciations might be regional, but I don't think that necessarily makes them "correct". A bunch of people saying something wrong doesn't always make it correct.

I've never considered aks the result of an accent and permissible anymore than "chipoLTee" in place of chipotle. </TEXT>
