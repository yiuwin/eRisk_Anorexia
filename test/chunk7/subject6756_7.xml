	<TEXT> This is a complete overhaul of a four year old desktop that just couldn't handle what I was doing anymore. It is however, my first custom build. Will mainly be used for (apart from everyday things) sound editing (I have a compatible sound card), 3D rendering and design, game design, big coding projects and moderate gaming (Dark Souls, Dawn of War II, Dragon Age, waiting for No Man's Sky, etc). I'll be hoping to run two 1440p monitors off it. 

So, any suggestions, changes, anything I done completely and utterly wrong?

Side note: Would it be worth waiting for the new Intel processors be worth it, or should I just go for it?  </TEXT>
