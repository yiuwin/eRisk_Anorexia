	<TEXT> I have had problems with an order, seller wont contact me back at all and it says my item has been preparing  for shipment for a week and a half. Amazon filed an a - z claim and just today apparently the claim was denied after it was already approved a couple days ago. The seller has now blocked me from sending messages. Not sure what to do here?

	<TEXT> These yellow triangles did not show up for at least 30 minutes to an hour after 12:00 am when the swagoboard was made available. Whoever completed the squares before these triangles appeared got screwed over cause the spins weren't even available on the squares yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well for some reason it took a while for the little triangle tabs to show up, showing how much spins you get for each square. So I am assuming since they didnt show up right away and I completed them I got screwed over and so did everyone else that completed them before the little orange triangles showed up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No that is only to receive the Swagbucks, you just have to complete the square to get whatever spin(s) it says on each square. I have not received any for the squares I completed and that was 2 and a half hours ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was wondering if anyone new what was going on with this situation? I completed quite a few square on my swago board but the little corner tabs on the squares didnt show up till 12:30 or 1:00 am, I didnt receive any of my spins. I completed a square just now at 3:00 am and received a spin but that makes me mad cause I should have been credited at least 14 or 15 now and it was because the little tabs showing the number of spins you get for completing the square didnt show up for an hour after they made the swagoboard available to complete at 12:00 am </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bought a dvd from a third party seller that I would not recommend "Better World Books" . They sent my package with "Asendia" and I have been reading the company is horrible, sometimes people dont even receive their stuff and Asendia doesnt answer to your emails. I was wondering if anyone has received stuff via Asendia and if it is safe? I emailed the third party seller "Better world Books" and they just keep saying the same thing. This is what they keep saying:

Hello,

Thank you for your email. International orders are shipped from the United States via Brokers Worldwide who then delivers your order to your local postal carrier for final delivery. The entire process takes 10-21 business days to arrive. As of today, it has been 1 business days. I'm afraid that we are unable to provide tracking on international shipments.

If you have any additional questions in the meantime, please be sure to let us know.

Sincerely,

You should be able to leave them while they play and do what you want in the mean time. Thats what I do. The nCrave ones are different they require you to stay on the page.

I'm very sorry about the delay in sending your order. While looking into this, I found a problem that was preventing your order from shipping. This is corrected now, and your order will be shipping soon.

To make up for the inconv,ience ,I've refunded the CDN$ 4.98 shipping charge for your order to your original payment method. </TEXT>

I recently bought Arkham Asylum and I am about half way through the game, for some reason I am having a thrill going through this game. I know it  has less of a combat system and gadgets than Arkham City but Arkham Asylum is way more menacing and in your face, has more quests, more villains and Dialogue. Just wondering is Arkham Asylum longer than City? </TEXT>
