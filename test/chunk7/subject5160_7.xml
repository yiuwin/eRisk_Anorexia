	<TEXT> Well, i'm sure Miura wants some $$$ too lol. Spin off novels have become a common thing for popular manga and anime, the creator of Attack on Titan has made a mint off of spin off novels (that he allowed other people to write). At least with this, Miura has signifigant direct involement so it won't be that much of a bastardization of the story like some of the Attack on Titan spinoff garbage is lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, what im getting at is that if he has 200 pages of ideas for the backstory of Grunbeld, incorporating it into the manga perhaps would be to much of a distraction to the main storyline to do. Perhaps he thought that he would have been cutting it too short if he included a smaller version of it in the manga. Who knows though, perhaps we'll see a abreviated version of it fleshed out in a future episode of the manga anways lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I imagine that there is a better chance of the novel getting translated than the supplemental materials. Its rather easy to market and sell novels these days with online distribution of written works, however things like guidebooks and artbooks are less readily distributable in electronic form in my opinion. There seems to be an increase lately in novel type works related to manga and anime being translated into english. For example, the first Record of Lodoss War novel is finally officially being translated into english. I imagine that if they are going really deep into Grunbeld's backstory via novel that it has little relevance towards the plot of the main storyline and that it is going to be so in depth that to incorporate it into the manga would be burdonsome. I could see him doing it via a spin-off manga, but the last time he worked on a different manga other than berserk, berserk went on hiatus lol </TEXT>

Virtually all of the Native Americans who lived in what is now new jersey were killed off or driven out of the area by the Dutch in colonial conflicts in the 1600's. The Federal government has repeatedly found no evidence to suggest that the people living in the Ramapo Mountains are in any manner related to the Lenape indians who had previously inhabited the area in Dutch times. Ther few Lenape's that were left in the western part state had sided with the French during the  French and Indian War, they were given the Brotherton Reservation, [but they lived there for only 40 some odd years until they decided to move to New York and left the reservation in 1801.](https://books.google.com/books?id=_r9Ni6_u0JEC pg=PA102 dq=new+jersey+indian+reservation hl=en sa=X ved=0ahUKEwi6vJmoprbTAhUM1CYKHd1NBMMQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage q=new%20jersey%20indian%20reservation f=false) </TEXT>
