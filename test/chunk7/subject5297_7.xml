	<TEXT> When I started 0-3, I thought my playoff hopes were all but over. The Loins of McCloin are battle tested now. I need A-A-Ron and the sneaky good Redskin O to keep rolling for a couple more weeks.  

Here's the final standings for League #2

THE 5 SACK MACKS (robert) are the worst team. There were a couple of teams with the same records but I awarded to the macks because they scored the least amount of points.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last Friday after the Dbags game, my friend and I were going through the schedule and theorizing about possible win-lose record to get into the playoff. We thought they would need to go 10-18 to finish the season. They're 1-2 now. How many wins do you think they need to get into the playoff? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think people would disagree with the points in the article but it's hilarious that is "mandatory". This what they focus on?  I would love to see the amount of time and money that will spent on this initiative. </TEXT>
