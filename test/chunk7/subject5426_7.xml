	<TEXT> A good way to figure out if they are legit is if they have a phone / address listed in the contact us, which they do.   
  
Also they don't have ridiculously low prices.
  
  
Looks ok, but i'd only buy if I trusted my bank, meaning I can get my money charged back if I get scammed.

	<TEXT> Ever played the rpg Earthbound on Snes?  
They have Rolling HP mechanic where when you take damage from an enemy, your health is drained as opposed to instantly being reduced, giving you a chance to heal before it hits 0 and you lose the battle.
  
  
Another cool one from Earthbound (Mother 3) different music is playing during battles, but when you order an attack, you can tap the button to the beat of the song to perform a combo attack! </TEXT>

You're right to feel that way about that time, because what Earthbound is essentially telling us is to never give up on friendship and love.
  
  
There's a long difficult road ahead for both, but have faith. </TEXT>

Keep in mind that in the future if you decide to upgrade you can cut your costs even more, for example; a 5 pack of coil heads might be like 5.00 + shipping. 
   
   
You can get 100 Feet of Kanthal for that much and how many coils can you get out of that? About 2-3 per foot, 200-300 coils!

	<TEXT> It's been a while since i've fiddled with those atomizer heads;  
When you unscrew the head from the tank, on the head you should be able to pop off the top part, exposing the coil and wick.   
  
If you see that it's really black or super gunked up you might consider replacing the coil or [\(clean and dry burning it\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY3NqqEg_pw hd=1)
  
  
If it looks ok, you can add a drop of juice or two directly onto the coil and snap the top and bottom part back together.   

  
Raising the voltage shouldn't damage the coil, what might happen is that juice will vaporize faster than the wick can bring new juice to the coil causing that burning taste. So you may need to take shorter hits at higher voltages.  </TEXT>

The game runs great, very little input delay.  
Netplay lagged too much for me to be enjoyable, like playing on a flatscreen tv but 2x worse.

You need to find someone close to matchup with, but even then the delay bothered me, so it wasn't for me.   


Just keep that in mind if you are really picky with delay like me.

	<TEXT> Yeah that's right sorry. Here's another way I thought of that may not be ideal but did come out correctly:
  
  
Put the smaller circle inside the center of bigger circle  
Select the two and make a blend   
Go to blend options and raise up the blend steps by like 100  
Drag out the smaller circle to the correct position  
If you can use it like this then good, otherwise select and expand  
select all again and merge with pathfinding  
Delete useless vertices  

Profit?? </TEXT>
