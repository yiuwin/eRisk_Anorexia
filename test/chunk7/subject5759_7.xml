	<TEXT> I've had good and bad experiences with all the big libraries for one client of ours. Eventually decided to install WKHTML on the server and use that to generate PDF from URLs it was passed, worked really well and is as close to a 1:1 conversion as I could find.

It's a bit more involved to setup than others (and you'll need permission to install it on the server itself) but it's been my go to for a good 12 months. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ajax is performed on the client side, meaning in your browser. Your browser has no real connection to your server, it only performs requests and displays responses via HTTP.

It's smart enough to know that an ajax call to '/api/posts' should map to the domain you're currently browsing, but that results in the same lookup as if it were hardcoded with the full domain.

This is just the nature of ajax, it's an asynchronous request to a URL over HTTP.

It's worth noting that your browser / ISP / DNS performing a lookup of a domain and routing to the correct place happens in a fraction of a second.

1. Your controller is trying to echo each value that gets passed to it, which is going to do nothing. If you want to debug what the controller is receiving use dd($order_check); which will dump all the values of $order_check and halt execution.

2. You're using $_POST to send the form but your $request-get() method is trying to get things from $_GET, you need to use $request-input().

	<TITLE> Looking for cheap USB stick run CDJ's or similar </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I've moved overseas and left a lot of my gear behind. The biggest being a pair of CDJ-2000.

Nowdays it seems standard for DJs to run off USB sticks, with CDJ's like the 2000-nexus or even the cheaper CDJ-350 working really well with high quality files from your USB stick slotting right onto the deck. I've got plenty of mixing experience but need something to practice on

CDJ-350s run around 700 for a pair, which is reasonable, but I don't want to spend that on something temporary.

I'm looking for the absolute cheapest pair of decks I can use with USB sticks, the kicker being without a laptop. I've got a mixer and soundcard etc if it's needed. Basically I want to practice playing on very cheap equipment via USB sticks to get into mixing without turntables. I don't want to spend much as I'll eventually get my CDJs shipped over.

Does anyone have suggestions for cheap decks to run music off USB sticks? I'm going to have to pony up the CDJ-350s otherwise and my bank account would rather not. Are there any controllers that don't require a laptop?

Appreciate any suggestions! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> sorry i really typed that out quickly.

In regards to JSON I was meaning the format in which your game server and database server communicate. For the kind of things you'd want in a database server json would be a pretty good option.

I would write the database server in PHP because I'm a PHP dev by day, but it's probably not the best language to write a web API for a game in. You want this to be the fastest it can be and there's probably better options than PHP.

If you run purely P2P multiplayer sessions (I don't know if you do or not) you don't need a game server at all, you could access the endpoints of your API directly from the client. In this situation the database server would take over validating the input of the methods making sure players are only doing things they should. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ahh I get ya,

You're probably going to have a GameServer, which will handle things like player positions, chat, things like that and then what we can call a DatabaseServer which would hold things like usernames, passwords, inventories, logout locations etc

Your client would connect to the game server and the game server would connect to the database server, getting users information as they login. The game server then can verify commands from players based on their input and update the database accordingly.

The important thing here is the game server only has methods that are valid, and it verifies them before ever touching the database server.

If I were to do this, I'd write the game server in Unity, using some of those amazing libraries and setup the database server as a PHP+MYSQL box, writing the methods with JSON i/o.

Hope that makes sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not if your client is the one communicating with the database. Your game client should have ZERO database info inside it. No exceptions. 

Your game client shouldn't care about SQL, it should only communicate via specific methods to a game server (via JSON, XML or similar) which runs queries, calculations etc.

Your game client should have absolutely ZERO authority over the games state, user state etc.

	<TEXT> Looks cool man. My only suggestion is the blue panel at the top of the page is way too large, it's over 50% of the fold on my 1920x1080 resolution. On my 1366x768 laptop I have to scroll over an entire screen to see any content.

I would suggest making that blue bar with the registration 500% smaller!

EDIT: actually looks so much better without it! http://imgur.com/CWsXUQV </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've looked at Amazons products and the Rackspace file storage but their pricing seems confusing and rather expensive. like $200+ pcm for 1TB when you factor in potential bandwidth. Is that right?

I'm needing to store and retrieve a huge amount of HQ audio to be streamed on a new project (like 25TB). I want to host the site and database on DigitalOcean, but their pricing for high volume storage is crazy.

Does anyone have a good suggestion for cloud style file serving? Or another option that would bring the price down?

	<TEXT> Can definitely appreciate that and in no way would I say that I've never seen some amazing sets on NI controllers etc because I absolutely have.

I guess I'm just concerned the skill in DJing is being replaced by software. DJs in bars used to at least be able to beatmix, as they only had CDJs or Turntables. These days I'm seeing more and more controllers and laptops with the DJ hitting sync and slowing dragging the crossfader across for a traincrash mix. I know that's not everybody, and these tools and features can allow for some amazing live sets but it also lowers the barrier to entry for a lot of people who should still be in their bedroom counting beats.

Sorry for the rant! I'm definitely keeping an eye on NI's stuff. They've done a lot of good for the EDM scene over the years.

	<TEXT> I enjoy listening to peoples work in progress and try to encourage people to get feedback from other producers but whenever I'm on this subreddit I feel like they clutter and detract away from real content and discussions.

Could we have a weekly (or monthly?) feedback thread and encourage people to post there instead? /r/edmproduction do a similar thing and it works a lot better.

DnB is getting bigger and bigger recently thanks to the likes of the Sigma boys and others, this subreddit has great potential and it's a shame to see discussions ignored as they get bumped off the front page by the constant influx of soundcloud links.

I'm not sure if this is a popular opinion or not, what do you guys think? I'd definitely post more DnB content here if it was more of an active discussion board rather than a link spam board.

While NI are obviously partnering with lots of big artists for the initial release I can see this becoming more of a tool for producers to keep their own tracks split for their own performances. 

While it's very cool, as a DJ it doesn't excite me very much. The best sets I've seen still come out of 2 turntables / CDJs and not a laptop and a bpm synced controller </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Labels websites usually list an email address or similar to send demos to. The standard in EDM seems to be a PRIVATE soundcloud link in an email. 

tips:

-Only send 1 or 2 tunes. Mention you've got more but represent yourself and your style in one tune and try show diversity in another. If they want more, they'll ask.

-Keep it short and sweet, give a small outline about your career so far, any notable achievements and try to give a reason why you'd fit into the labels style.

-Use different private links for different labels, put their name in the title.

-DON'T RELEASE ANYTHING IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY GET ON A LABEL. If you've already blown half the bang by uploading your best tune to soundcloud / spotify / beatport then labels are not going to be very interested, they're looking to craft a release around their own style, audience etc. And they're definitely better at it than me or you.

GOOD LUCK!  </TEXT>

You would have routes like this:

 Route::get('/form', 'controller@get');

 Route::post('/form', 'Controller@post);

 Route::get('/sayhi/{name}, 'Controller@sayHi');

Your form page would post to /form and the post() function in that controller would end up doing this

 return redirect('/sayHi/'.$r-input('name'));

This may not be the best way to achieve what you're trying to do (you didn't really explain why it needed to be like this) but it's possible to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In terms of full IDE's I've got good experience with PHPstorm and Netbeans, currently settled on the former.

PHPstorm has all the things I need, a REST client, GUI for git merging, 2 key combos commit and push my code, PSR formatting to name a few.

It's true that netbeans has plugins or extensions for all of these things too, I used a lot of them. I find however that everything in PHPstorm follows the same workflow or practice, as for netbeans plugins, you're at a mercy of the plugin developer and I'd often find different plugins have completely different workflows or ideas about how to achieve something. PHPstorm just feels like a more integrated experience.

A few drivers have come out publicly to say this strike isn't about pay, but about the mandatory night shifts. If that's their sticking point then it's no wonder TFL couldn't reach an agreement, as the unions are fighting change within the LU system, a change that needs to happen to continue progress in many sectors of London.

	<TEXT> Many of us here survive on less and there's no shortage of people who would like to have a job within London Underground. The concept TFL are proposing (night shifts to start a 24 hour tube service) is not new to anyone who does shift work. If people are really concerned about doing 54 night shifts (instead of the current 7-14 night shifts) per year they are more than welcome to leave and make space for someone who has no issue with it.

Technology changes, services change, job descriptions change. If it were not for the unions this would be a pretty simple restructuring period.

I have friends here who work a similar schedule of shifts for a lot less than these people get. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those guys don't get anywhere near 100k for a set mate. Headlining tomorrowland after a huge year of record sales maybe it's possible, but DJs just don't get that much for every gig.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's hard to say without seeing the mixer but it sounds like you've boosted frequencies.. Things are sounding pretty square.

Try aggressively cutting in your eq's - I think you'll find the sound you want and hear from each instrument is but a fraction of the space it's currently occupying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've got HS7's for DnB in our flat, perfect. HS8's would have been too big for us. The 7" sound seriously great, they're not very forgiving either which is a good thing compared to the low end on KRKs (oh god i hope didn't start a yamaha/krk argument). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure you could use the soundcloud API to do a request for your followers.

https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#users

Under 'subresources' is:

GET 	/users/{id}/followings 	list of users who are followed by the user

that would return what you need. Wish I had time to write a little script for ya but I'm at work atm </TEXT>
