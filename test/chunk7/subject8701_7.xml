	<TEXT> I know they can use product placement, but the rules are a LOT stricter than outside of the UK/European Union, so would not use it extensively, if at all (like many TV companies)

The reach would not be enough to earn much from that product placement either. They can't take the platform international as that would be BBC Worldwide remit, and BBC Worldwide already have a LOT of contracts tying to the broadcast of content. For example; I can't view new episodes of Doctor Who in Sweden because a Danish (or maybe Norwegian) companies owns the rights to all of Scandinavia but does not operate a channel in this country.

I don't think it would work at all.

-edit-

One of the restrictions is:

"They also cannot be placed in religious, current affairs and consumer advice programmes made for UK audiences. Products cannot be placed in news or children's programmes.

"

This is a LOT of content produced by the BBC that they would have to throw away. </TEXT>

Even the shittiest content will attract a ton of advertisers wanting to get their product in it. After all, the ads around the show change, but the product placement barely does (some situations it will, but not many).

The BBC would not be able to rely on that product placement to fund the development of their shows. They will need to rely on a subscription fee, which I don't think would be enough to fund content at the same level NetFlix does. It would be more ITV content. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People produce the content you are reading, yes? They need to earn a living. If you are blocking adverts, that is less money going into that company. This means they may need to go down the route of advertorials, which are not good for anybody. 

When adverts are blocked, the following happens:

- People lose their jobs
- Most content is suddenly produced by PR firms who have an agenda to push.
- Less money to spend on investigative journalism.

I own a couple of news websites. Non-intrusive ads, similar to what you see on Reddit on the sidebar. While page views have shot up in recent years, the amount of money made from that adverts has gone down drastically. I think page views have gone up by 100% in the past 2 years while advertising revenue has fallen by 33%, and it continues to fall. This meant that I have less money to divert to content on the website. This causes either: less content produced, or lower quality articles. 

You could go down the route of having a subscription service for your news, but that is only really going to work if you are an established name in the business as it is. I would hate to think how a small news agency would thrive on that model.

TL;DR: You are contributing to a decline in quality content and potentially causing people to lose their jobs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 150 a year (or whatever it is now), is absolutely nothing for what you get. The shows on the BBC are regarded as some of the best in the world. These are shows that other companies would not even take a gamble at producing. The BBC News is regarded as one of the least biased news sources in the world, the radio is regarded as fucking fantstic.

Yes, I know you do not need a licence to access the BBC News website or to listen to the radio. If the TV licence disappeared, ads would need to be displayed on the BBC News website and people would get pissed. Hell, the ads on international versions of the BBC are not that intrusive and they still irritate me. 

I am tired of people saying "but I don't watch anything on the BBC". Well, you may not. However, chances are that you are watching something that has been inspired by BBC programming in the past, whether it is a comedy, a documentary, or something completely different.

If the BBC disappeared, people would complain. Not just in the UK, but worldwide.

Granted, I have never had a negative feedback for quality before, but it came at an awful time.

That being said, I have sold about 4,000 gigs and dealt with 2,000 separate customers. I have a few orders left which should cover up the negative very quickly. Just, I do not really want the comment tied to my name. It is more the content of the comment than the fact that he left the comment in the first place. Negative feedback is fine. Getting personal with the feedback is not fine.

The guy is a fellow seller on the site, so I figured he would have understood, but I guess not.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still was paid for the content. He did not ask for a refund. I have been paid. The only way in which he could have left negative feedback is if he paid for the gig. 

And yes, I responded that it was out of the scope of my gig, but I don't think many people read the seller's response. I hope they do.

It was not just sales copy. I can deal with sales copy when I have time. It is more the fact he wanted me to do keyword research, format it using HTML etc. That is where my inexperience is. He seems to think that this should be offered in my gig. It was all due within 24 hours, took me 36 hours total. Mainly due to a personal issue, which I informed him of. He said it was "wildly late" and then I stated I had a personal issue and he said "I am not your boyfriend. You get content done on time. I don't care about your issues" or some shit like that. Then he sent abusive messages calling me a liar about why I did not get done on time, yet still refused to explain what I had done wrong. Then his final message was "don't contact me again. let's see if you can follow that instruction, because you did not on the order". 

I really would not mind a negative feedback. He is allowed to do that. Not everybody is going to like what I do. However, bringing personal issues into it is plain wrong. Fiverr already said I can't have the feedback removed as it is 'the truth', but I would rather not have the reason why I was sick slapped up on my gig for the world to see for the rest of my life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I produced content for a major personal injury law firm. 30 articles per week, four years. That is a LOT of content.

However, when I was reading what other writers were producing, I was fucking stunned. I had top quality content being sent in. I was being paid a packet for it. These other writers, being paid the same amount, were half-arsing it. They would talk about shit not even relevant to personal injury. The company did not seem to care about actually *helping* people, as they claimed. They cared about climbing up the search engines. I know most companies are like this, but at least pretend that you want to help. If you head to a personal injury website with the terms "personal injury help in blah blah", you really should not be writing about how to groom a fucking horse.

Yet, the company still remains massive, generating millions each year. Baffles me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a very big niche, but I suppose it could be a niche. 

I spend a lot of my time writing for small businesses on a national level in Sweden. However, I mainly help those small businesses try to beef up the English side of their website, so the work I do is very specific. I am not 100% what I would call myself. I just tell people that I produce content for small businesses in Sweden.

I talk to them about how my content can help them make money. They don't care that I write, they care that I make money for them. I could write "all of our customers are shit" and if they make 10x the amount of money they were making before, they probably would not give a crap (I have actually done that, but because my client wanted to change their image. Surprisingly, it worked!)

So yeah, talk about *how* your content benefits people. Do not just tell them that you write, because they don't care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes.

I took an order on one of the popular gig websites. He ordered something that was out of the scope of my gig. Product descriptions or some shit like that. This coincided with me being in the hospital. Well, I have just got out. My gig was not meant to take orders, but somehow it managed to become unpaused when I sent a custom offer to a client.

I did not want to do the gig, but he told me he was DESPERATE for it. I have never done product descriptions before. I have NEVER had a person complain about what I have written.

Guess what? I delivered it. Not only did he launch a personal attack on me for being severely sick, but he said it was the worst content he had ever read. I got in touch with him, and he just continued to insult me more.

Now, I have a personal attack about my health in a public setting, the first negative feedback I have ever received in 4 years, and now I feel fucking terrible that I let down a customer.

I mean, when we are talking a SERIOUS attack on me, 90% of his feedback was an attack on me, the other 10% was an attack on the content.

I figured product descriptions were you know....describing the product. But no, apparently I am meant to go beyond 'describing' the product and was meant to guess what he wanted. I did not want the damn gig in the first place, but he said he was in a pickle.

I spent fucking 3 hours on it for $5 to help him out on my day off. What do I get at the end? $1.50 an hour and something which could potentially ruin my gig because the negative feedback is so damn prominent.

I just had to vent. In four years (could be five), this is the first person to dislike anything that I wrote and to do it and not tell me WHY I went wrong is just even worse.

Have a good day, folks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most laws in a legal system require two parts:

1. Actus Reus (the committing of the act)
2. Mens Rea (an intent to commit that act. In some cases, you need to know that it is wrong)

Some crimes are 'strict liability'. This means that you only need the 'actus reus'. I think having sex with a child is a strict liability crime. So, even if you done everything to check they were of age, it is still a crime to sleep with them and you will be punished.

But yeah, for most crimes, you need to prove that the person knew they were doing something wrong. Theft, for example, if I took a biscuit thinking it was my biscuit that I left behind earlier, should I be charged with theft? No. However, if I knew I was stealing that biscuit from somebody, I should be.  </TEXT>
