	<TEXT> I hate the ads too, especially on my phone even some of the skip buttons dont work sometimes and I end up having a 3-10 minute unskipable ad. I just have to exit the whole and try again with different ads, its quicker to have 6 15 seconds ads with vairety than a 10 minute video about shit I dont about. In the end after a week of living like this I just watch it on my laptop with adblock, works like a charm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That whole 'article' is bull, the author was disregarding the mens feelings of betrayal and such. If she couldn't be honest now what else could she be lying about? The author was contradicting herself as well. She mentions when the guy goes 'its not you but me' line was cliche however she later says its guys who are shallow and their fault. Later when the "experiment'' was switched yes women might not care about being tricked into a date with an obese man as much as men, however women are more equal to fear mens height as men are to weight. Also another factor to consider is the idea of obese, no one wants to date someone who doesn't care enough about their own health to which will die in a couple of years because of the health problems. Like dating anyone who is fit or fat, obesity is a life style which some don't match with and being with an obese person is a burden, physically,mentally and emotionally. Guys dont mind a little weight here nor there, most prefer it. There's a big difference between obese and over weight. 

I don't know what that article was meant for but there are some problems with it, like a sample size of 5 is too small and such. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [TOMT] [Movie] prison island? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-03 02:41:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ok its a movie i saw like 10 minutes of the beginning, and its older than the 90s, i think. It starts off with a guy being dropped off in an island , i think its for prisoners or something and he meets up with an old guy, and starts asking how to get off the island and the old guy is like "can't, just accept that you're here". The guy dropped off is a ex military something and is looking to get off the island or for someone. It looked 80s maybe earlier cause the guy had a mullet i think and the film looked it. - its not papillon , or No escape and i'm not confusing it with escape from new york either. 

Please help me!!  </TEXT>

A person goes up to them wanting to buy (a xmas tree i think) and the skinny one is wearing glasses and a sweater and all nice while the other is dressed up as a gangster with a grill and such. The scare the poor white guy off or maybe the make the sale, but after he leaves the two guys laugh and they swap characters removing the grill and now the skinny guy is the threatening one.  

Thanks in advance!

	<TEXT> hey, I'm looking for a youtube short film where its a zombie apocalypse and the story is centered around two teenagers both male, It takes placed mostly in the guys backyard and street. I think they meet a girl by a car? and there's a chase scene down the street but I don't know, I saw it a couple of years ago, it might have been a short mini series but it wasn't professional. Thanks anyway. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [TOMT] [MOVIE] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-21 13:19:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> hey, I'm looking for a movie I only saw the ending of it at least 5 years ago. From what I gather it's about a Guardian angle who looks after a family or interacts with them. Some stuff happens but at the end she is given a choice she wants to help the family (or stay on earth) but at the price of losing her memory and becoming human (and staying on earth). I can at least tell you I think she is blonde, and its a family Christmas movie. 

Please help.

Edit: Thank you to everyone's suggestions! I found my movie :) I had to check the ending on all of them to see so sorry for the late reply. </TEXT>
