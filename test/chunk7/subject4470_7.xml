Neh, I disagree. 

First with the "never more than ~25 movies better than 6/10". Out of 1000's?? Do you browse them all regularly? I'm kind of a movie snob and have more faith in Netlix than that.

If Netlix just gives me just two choices that leaves no middle ground. And the middle ground is what's most important to me, as it is the middle ground that will allow me to see the *likelihood* of whether I should even bother with a movie or not. 
If I have a 6/10 movie next to a 8/10 movie, which one am I gonna choose? Obviously the 8/10, right? BUT, if on a thumb scale, where there is only 2 choices, both movies would hold the same weight. And they would be recommended, as if, the *likelihood* that I would like them would be the same. That is not true when the likelihood is actually greater with the 8/10. Thumbs work for the casual, not so much for movie snobs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kinda my point. Netflix only works for people passionate about film if they actually take the time to rate movies. The algorithm Netflix uses then recommends based on what you like. The more you rate, the more nuanced and specific your profile will become. In theory, anyways. I say in theory, cuz many of us have lovely others who like to fuck with our profiles by handing out a 5 to a Michael Bay flick. If you don't take the time to rate, then Netflix rec's fall to more of a "default" mode which will probably just give you some metacritic, IMDB, rating. Which is more of what a casual movie watcher would rate something, anyways. Which is fine if that's what you want. Personally, I found it worth it to take the time to rate the shit tons of movies I did, cuz Netflix usually was pretty spot on on making sure not to recommend Adam Sandler.


My point is pretty much moot, though, now with the thumb rating scale. So, ehh..   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah, neither would I, but a casual movie fan I would consider to be someone like my pops. Who likes his fast paced action and thrillers, and his occasional comedy; generally movies that don't require him to have to think too hard. He finds that the time one takes to watch a movie should be one of absolute relaxation and this includes of the mind. Thinking requires work. He doesn't give a shit about who a Lars Von Trier, an Inarritu, or even a Chris Nolan is, let alone, what they would be working on next. Try and explain to him what a *leit motif* is? Fuck that, why even bother. He doesn't care. And I totally get it. 


Essentially watching and being able to enjoy a movie is a luxury. And since it is a luxury, we should be able to choose to be as passionate (or not) about a movie, as we want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I guess by "dirty racing" being a skill, I meant it more from a defensive standpoint vs. an offensive one which would require some maneuvering in order to look out for and defend, especially when you are surrounded by a shit ton of other cars going close to 200 mph. And as far as restrictor plates go in NASCAR, I'm not sure how all that works. I thought they only used those for a limited number of races. Idk. Just like I don't know what the most difficult motorsport is. Not when you have crazy hard endurance races like the Le Mans, Baja, Isle of Man, etc, etc. It'd be super awesome if we had more pros doing cross racing. Then we would could get some more tangible feedback.

Thanks for the awesome reply.

Oh, and btw, my favorite motorsport would most def be dragsters. NHRA is fucking insane. Especially when you watch them live. With pit passes. Gnarly

Some of the most convincing I've heard are from NASCAR fans. Something about how physical and dirty those guys race make it pretty impressive. 


Deep down in my gut, I wanna say rally racing would be the hardest, but God damn, there are just way too many variables within each sport that make it super hard to say definitively. Many could argue crazy shit for each discipline, I'm sure.

And let's be honest, most of us are armchair experts anyways.

	<TEXT> Went for a 3 day stay for part of a Mexico trip back when I was 16 (20 yrs ago..). *3 days is no where long enough!*. I really hope to make it back before I croak, sometime. So, so much beauty and culture and history there. I also feel that I can probably appreciate it more, now that I'm somewhat more "mature". Managed to get in some of the major stuff like the zocalo, pyramids, and Xochimilco, but like this library, I feel like there is so much more to see. </TEXT>

Surely, they haven't not smoked weed this whole time simply cuz it was illegal??

	<TEXT> It ain't the content of the photograph that is bad. That bridge is, indeed, pretty awesome looking and makes for some great photos. What some people are trying to say here is the way the tone (brightness, contrast, saturation, etc) has been fucked with, actually hurts the quality of the photo, in terms of beauty. To be fair, some people like the way this particular photographer messes with his pics, which is why he does have over 1,300 followers on the site. Some people have *unique* tastes. This is also reflected with the 200 some-odd likes. 



Also, this photo is **not** 4862X3232p. It is actually 808X537p. You have to pay $149 for a 4862X3232 copy of the jacked photo to the jacked site. </TEXT>
