I'm sorry but I think this might be a liberal term to segregate a population.  "You are X, You are Y, and you guys are Z.  I love you all but the black Z are segregated for their plight. The Indian Y need help for housing. Gen X gays are with the cause because we are for the rights of Franklin."  Who the crap is Franklin? It doesn't matter, it's Franklin... and if your not behind Franklin, you are a racist.  Who the fuck is Franklin?

	<TEXT> They are now trying to get on the good side of President Trump. They have basically isolated themselves from President Trump and Trump voters.  They knowingly did so thinking they had much more dominance and clout. Upon realizing that their leverage was that of a small child and slapped down continuously, they are now trying desperately to get back into the game by actually reporting the news. This is such a short sighted goal. They have isolated more than half the country with their "fake news" and will destroy their small following by telling the truth leaving CuckNN all alone to shrivel like a raisin. The strategy of a stubborn pre-schooler.  </TEXT>

If MX president goes to meet President Trump, he bends a knee to the wall. The cartels own him. They would definitely make sure he won't be doing that. That's why the MX shills in public office are screaming for UN intervention because of the USA's human rights violation. If they don't, they will be hanging from a bridge. </TEXT>

Would you like to fly on plane with someone just out of school, or an airline pilot with 22 years experience?

Would you pick your surgeon from the Interns or a Dr. with 22 years experience.

You get the picture. Like I said before, I've bought a shit load of beans in my life and never had a roast this light called an "Espresso Roast". Because of this quantity or experience, I don't assume I'm better than anyone. BTW: She told me if I want it darker, "Why don't you go to the grocery store and buy some." That was the icing on the cake, as they say.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome. Thanks. We were talking about our brine for the turkey this last Thanksgiving which had numorous lemons and limes.  Why didn't the turkey cook like a ceviche? You guys were the only one I could think of for the question. Google googled nothing. Thanks. 

On a side note: HEB and Kroger used to take all thier fish trimmings and put them in a bin for easy ceviche. It was like $2 a pound. They no longer do that. Shame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In all my years, I have never seen the democratic party so impotent in all my life. 
Chuck Schumer grasping at straws with quick logos, Al Sharpton can't get more than 800 people to march on Washington for the inauguration, the MSM who can't grasp a piece to run with...the train is in motion and they are throwing everything and anything at a moving wall. If something sticks...it's 20 feet behind us.

I just have never seen the news and Dems so powerless. What's next? Kill elderly and babies while steeling the money from blacks, Mexicans and gays? We are a mile in the front of that B fucking S. </TEXT>
