	<TEXT> I'm not OP, but I've only had two best friends in my whole life. The way we became best friends at first was pretty awkward--we've all been polar opposites ready to challenge each other. I made my best friends by wanting to be around that person, or being forced into situations where I had to be. You just click with that person.

tldr; Even if you're an introvert, try to accept and be around others. Like OP said, if there is chemistry, things will work out. </TEXT>
