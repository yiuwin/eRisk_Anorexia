	<TEXT> I had a HIDA-scan, it's where they inject you with nuclear contrast and watch as it goes through your stomach and gallbladder and all that good stuff. I actually got to lay there and watch it as it was going through, haha. You lay under this big machine that's directly over your chest and abdomen for an hour if I remember correctly. 
I've had IBS for years but my gallbladder just stopped working and starting decaying so it exasperated all my symptoms. I knew something was up when I was vomiting bile every night.  </TEXT>

I break down every once in a while and say screw it :( It's actually never affected me this badly before! But I know now it's a massive no-no. 
They have lactose free cheese? Well I may not be out of luck then! My love for cheese is awful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah! I'm not alone! My first thought was "Yup, this is it. I'm done for." But, I never thought of the bile concept, it is mostly green so that would make sense if it's not digesting right and moving right through me.
My doctor prescribed me that exact thing but my insurance wouldn't cover it and it was almost $100 every place I checked. I'm just gonna have to suck it up and pay for it cause seriously, this is awful.

	<TEXT> But does anyone ever have a bowel movement (specifically diarrhea) that smells like straight vomit? 
I suffer from IBS-M and have actually been backed up pretty bad for a few days but today the flood gates were opened and dear god in heaven, for the first time in my life I was appalled and disgusted at what came out of me and how it smelled. It was like vomit, but out of my ass.
I've had a battery of tests, including stool samples/fecal occult, multiple x-rays, CT scans, MRI's, and everything is normal. I have had my gallbladder out though and my doctor is starting to think that's what's causing a lot of the D symptoms I deal with. But I've never had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, barium swallow, etc. 
I'm lactose intolerant and had eggs then a sandwich with cheese on Saturday, then Sunday I wasn't feeling so great - bloated, gassy, crampy, and had to do everything in my power to keep from vomiting, even though I didn't have anything in my stomach. This lasted until tonight (all I ate from Sunday until tonight was two pieces of toast, but hydrated like crazy), when I finally ate some toast and warm chicken broth, then promptly shat my brains out. Which is fine with me honestly, constipations makes me feel much worse. 
But anyways! I was just curious if anyone else has ever dealt with this? I'm not sure what it could be from (besides the eggs and/or cheese) or if I should be alarmed? 
Thanks for any input!  
Tl;dr - No gallbladder, lactose intolerant, ate cheese and eggs Saturday, constipated and sick until tonight when I had putrid vomit smelling diarrhea. Am I rotting from the inside out or does this happen?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you have an endoscopy you're under *twilight* anesthesia, you're not completely put under but you're semi-conscious and probably not going to remember anything. They spray your throat with an awesome numbing stuff and tell you to swallow it, you won't gag. You'd obviously not even have anything in your stomach, as with any procedure it requires fasting. So you're not going to vomit or aspirate or anything. My mom has had it done and said it was a breeze. 
So if you do end up having it, seriously don't worry. It's incredibly simple. But I agree with /u/shesabro, some illnesses just really tax certain parts of your body and maybe losing your voice is your lingering symptom. Try not to worry yourself sick, I truly know how hard it us, but there's nothing you can do about it right now anyways.
The ENT will get you all fixed up and you'll get your voice back and everything is going to be fine :) If you had cancer or a bleeding ulcer, there'd be more symptoms than that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have BP1 and was on trileptal from the time I was 14 until I was 22. It was honestly the only thing that worked for me, I tried too many to mention in the span of a couple years.
Trileptal kept me stable, although I still had breakthrough periods of depression and hypomania. But between that, keeping my appointments with my pdoc, and different types of therapy, I was as good as I had ever been. My dose had to be upped throughout the years as I grew but I honestly never had any issues with it. Just made me sleepy :)
I only went off of it due to not being able to afford it cause I didn't have any insurance at the time and then I had a nervous breakdown, so yeah. Even though I have insurance now, my pdoc thought it'd be best to try a mixture of new meds due to new symptoms, new diagnoses, and what not. 
But if it doesn't suit you, there are many others you can try until you find the perfect one :) It's always hit and miss with this stuff. But good luck! Just wanted to share my positive experience :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't over think it :) Some days you just aren't as hungry as usual. Doesn't mean you're getting sick, especially if you're feeling just fine. 
But don't worry, it happens. It's good you're at least eating even if you aren't really hungry. I have days where I feel just fine but I'm not hungry, but I still eat cause, well, you have to eat and if I don't I end up feeling sick anyways.

	<TEXT> Actually your description didn't bother me, it's more me actually being/feeling sick or seeing/hearing someone get sick. Reading about it doesn't bother me, thankfully. A lot of people are definitely triggered by even seeing the word vomit, but I've never gotten to that point. But I just started therapy so I'm keeping my fingers crossed it at least helps me learn to cope. I didn't think it was as common as it is, it actually took me up until last year to come clean about it with my doctors cause I thought I was seriously crazy. They didn't realize how severe it was at first but it actually ruined my life and I ruined my body cause of it. 
Oh god, no wonder you're scared of getting IV's :( My mom has that problem, she comes home from the hospital with HUGE bruises and swollen hands and arms. Her veins are itty bitty, they roll and blow, and our hospital absolutely sucks at drawing blood and placing IV's. You wouldn't have a nice time at our hospital, haha. They placed my IV in my hand wrong once and it blew, my hand swelled up three times it's normal size. So I can only imagine how you feel :( 
I think since I've taken Phenergan so long (4-5 years) the sleepiness and grogginess doesn't bother me as much anymore. Plus I really try to fight it, haha. I take it every night before bed cause I wake up in the middle of night feeling sick most nights and it just helps me avoid that. My mom takes it too but it still knocks her out. Zofran also gives me headaches so I try to save it as a last resort.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually have severe emetophobia and I'm in therapy for it, haha. You're like a hero to me, I couldn't deal with that. 
I actually take Phenergan almost daily (I also have endometriosis and IBS so my tummy gets upset a lot) and have a backup bottle of Zofran, they are seriously lifesavers. The Phenergan works best for me though, especially given in an injection with Ativan when I've been really sick. 
But that's awesome you can catch the episodes sometimes before they get out of hand. I've heard of people who have almost no warning then absolutely nothing helps :( 
Edit: stupid words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're looking into whether medication to shrink them or a thyroidectomy is my best option. They're growing and my thyroid is enlarged so I'm leaning towards surgery, I'm fine with taking pills the rest of my life to replace it. I just don't want to feel like crap anymore :/ 
It sounds like you've got your hands full with all of those conditions! Bless your heart. It's amazing how much your thyroid controls though, I never though you could get this sick from it. 
But you have something I'd rather die than ever develop - cyclic vomiting syndrome. Dear god, how do you live with it? Your thyroid being out of whack cannot be helping that at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still have lasting issues even though my levels are normal, but I do have several thyroid nodules. Those can do wacky things too. But an endocrinologist is who you want to talk to. Usually, most GP's wont touch thyroid problems with a ten foot pole and usually send you to a specialist. I had to fight for a referral and they tried to put me on medication that could have potentially worsened the problem, so I hope you have better luck :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Manic = bulimic
Depression = anorexia 

When I'm manic I binge like a mother f*cker then try to get rid of it. When I'm depressed, I have no appetite, food is unappealing and makes me feel fat and sick. So, I go 2-4 days without a bite of food. I'm down to 107lbs. at the moment, I've been in a really bad depression the past few weeks. But, I think I might be coming out of it so I'm waiting for the urge to binge to hit. 
It's a good awful cycle. When I'm manic, I spend so much money but a lot of times it can be on food alone. I've bought full sheet cakes and eaten them by myself within a day. 
I never knew if there was a link, I've often wondered though. 
Edit: Forgot to add that my ED came along only a couple years ago, so bipolar has been around a whole lot longer.  </TEXT>
