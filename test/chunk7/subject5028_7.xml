	<TEXT> I think the issue with California was that it changed the bands genre.I noticed that A LOT of people who didnt like blink before suddenly became die hard blink fans after California. People that like the more poppy alternative were very fond of the album. The more pop/rock side of people (the older fans) dont like it as much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think its been pretty obvious by now that wiki leaks is no longer under assange's control but I think the way they suddenly took a 180 on this topic insinuates that they know Assange is dead.

First tweet asking the people what proof of life they would like to see(late October): https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/790406530738913285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw

	<TEXT> I think they just can't be arsed to actually update their fans on the progress of the game. If I remember correctly the game already went on a long development hiatus before with 0 communication. I think unless the fans push the devs to actually care or push the current devs out, nothing will change.  The most deceiving word developers can use when talking about game progress is "soon" and it seems like it's the only word that these devs know.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So before I start, I wanna say that I was reluctant to go to college and really only did so to try it out and to please my parents. I'll be honest though at first I actually kinda enjoyed it. It was kinda like high school 2.0 but I enjoyed it. I'm taking a bunch of bullshit freshman classes and then a programming class. All my bullshit classes except math are fine so I'll only talk about math. The math class was super shitty right off the bat. I have an awful professor and he rants about stuff that doesn't pertain to the math being taught and also yells at you for not knowing something. The dude is really bad. I saw no point in going to that class after about 4 weeks and just stopped going and only went in for tests. My programming class started out really well. I was way ahead of the class (I had decent programming knowledge before hand). Although a couple of weeks ago we started getting into loops and loops with methods and everything crashed. I stopped understanding everything. I stopped turning in weekly assignments because I just didn't know how to do them. Now I have a really bad grade and have a quiz tomorrow that I didn't know about and gave another weekly assignment due and I stopped showing up to class because I was not sure what was going on. My parents still think I have great grades and that I love it. I still live at home so they nag me all the time. Ive been in a free fall of panic recently because I dont like college (not the big one in at rn at least) and it's not what I want to be doing. I'm 100 sure of that. My heart isn't here and I don't what to do anymore. I've just been waiting for my break to recollect and get my shit back together to finish the semester out okay but my only break is Thanksgiving break (next week) which is literally the week before the semester ends. I'm so fucked at this point. I think I want to goto a trade school and seek a associates degree instead of dealing with all these bullshit classes at a huge university. I also am almost positive that comp sci is not where I want to be. I just need some advice on what people think I should do. I've come to grips with the fact that this semester is most likely fucked and I basically messed it up. I just don't know what to do with myself or what to tell my parents. I'm just so unmotivated and unhappy with it all but I brought it upon myself.

	<TEXT> That's exactly what I was thinking. Im 90% sure that whatever update they put out before the end of the year(if they put an update out) wont be the game completing one that they need and will have so many new bugs that will make the game unplayable. If I had to take a stab at what I think the next update will contain, I would say it will contain some minor big fixes, maybe 1-2 new online maps, a very small customization feature and probably a message saying "sorry the private server function is still in testing." I bet we either wont see the soccer game mode added or it will be another year until it is released. I'm just so sick of devs that are like this. We paid $20 for their game that should've been $5, the least the devs can do is show that they care about the game and are still working on it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This game is a sitting gold mine. I've seen a couple of posts about this game on the front page and people seem highly interested in it but wont buy the game because of the messy state its in. It's a real shame because this could be a fantastic game if the devs REALLY cared about it and talked to the fans about what content they would like to see in it. I'm pretty convinced as of now that the development of the game has either come to a temporary halt or is so slow that nobody wants to talk about it. All the developer accounts have stopped talking on the steam forums. All the twitter accounts have been pretty much silent about the game. I would at the very fucking least like a monthly update about the status of the game. Seeing as their are 3-4 devs on this game that shouldn't be THAT big of a task to ask for. I've just been waiting to play the game again because right now it's still too buggy and to be frank, kinda boring with the same 5 maps we have available and with the lack of any server setup/private server function. I saw the soccer game mode that they showcased at E3 a half a year ago and it got me so excited for the future of this game, but now im not sure again. It's just looking like i gave $20 to a dev company that isnt going to finish a game. I would love to be proved wrong though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the game is great but there is a lot of things that should be fixed imo and it just doesn't seem like they have enough time to do it all. Some of it is pretty big too like adding the ability to build over paths with train tracks. Changing the UI would be really big too. As well as adding more large scale management options so we didn't have to micromanage as much. Betas (especially a late one) are meant more for bug fixing than adding or largely changing big features. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep "big update" has been scheduled to release "soon" since early august. Funny cause the full game is supposed to be released before the end of the year. The game needs  a new dev team. They took out most of the games content a year ago to update it all to unity 5 and just havent put most of it back in. Its kind of a train wreck at the moment from a development standpoint. They also want to add more game modes but cant even finish the base game. Its honestly getting very upsetting. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was super hyped for the game until i saw this mechanic. I thought this was going to be a slightly more realistic sea battle mechanic. The swiveling cannons doesn't even bother me as much as the almost instant reload time does. You can pretty much just destroy an enemy by barraging them with tons of cannons and hardly aiming. Also the ships appear to have very little effect when a cannon hits their ship which is sorta weird to me. Shouldn't the ship at least shake a lot? Just some concerning things i noticed about the game. I dont think the game is supposed to be realistic but i honestly think it would be more fun if you couldn't just win by sending 30 cannonballs in under a minute at a ship from just 3 cannons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im a new backer but have been following the game since early this year. I just started playing and really enjoy the game. The ship battles are awesome. I want to know if the devs would be open to putting in really small rowboats for like 2 v 2 battles so we can have more personal battles because as much as I love the big ship battles, they're usually mostly out of your control unless you are the ship captain. You are just relying on so many people to do their part and do things like you want them to. I would just love to see a really small scale gamemode where you can play with a small group of friends pretty much and just go at it. Like maybe have a small swivel gun on the front of each of them and maybe one cannon exclusively in the front as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For some reasons the devs have never been in communication with the community besides some comments on the steam discussion boards every now and then. The game updates pretty slowly and the last update was a month ago. I wouldn't expect too much from this game because as it currently stands it usually takes from 1-3 months for every update that usually just add a map to the online mode. Its extremely slow development. Also they had pretty much completely abandoned the game until the last year or so. They slowly started developing it although they took out a lot of features and game modes when they upgraded to unity5 and don't seem to be putting them back in anytime soon which is very aggravating.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine wasn't a corps but rather a pretty solid College drum line. I went in with a ton of confidence and even went to their help sessions that they offered before auditions. What was weird was that at the help sessions I got 0 feedback. Everyone around me did, but not me and I let that get to my head. Anyways fast forward to auditions, I know the packet really well and have been working on it for months now. I practiced everyday and worked on something everyday. I was 110% sure I was gonna make it. There's no way I couldn't. 

I get to auditions and for some reason I thought it'd be a good idea to use sticks I was familiar with to help better my chances but boy was I wrong. Everyone else had the recommended sticks and I had the lightest pair of sticks that were even in production. When I hit the hit it just sounded awful. I never thought to even switch out sticks. 

Finally, we get to the parradiddle exercise which I had worked my ass off on and he tells us to go down the line. This scared the living shit out of me because my buddy who had made it the previous year said there was no individual playing sections so this caught me totally off guard. I was the last person in the line to go. I watched as 15 people either excelled at playing it or completely bombed it. The nerves in me start building to an insane level. Finally they get to me and I stop to take a moment to gather myself and relax. I started playing the exercise and the sticks sounded and felt awful on that head. I got three bars into the exercise and blanked. I started skipping around and playing random patterns and then just choose to stop playing and shamefully put my head down since I had just completely destroyed he exercise. I played it by far the worst our of everyone. I was then cut shortly after that and was pretty much told that I sucked on a fundamental level; that I needed to learn how to just rebound the stick and play better overall because my sound quality was awful. I just went home from disappointment in myself. 

Now I am still trying to make a comeback from that and audition for a top 12 corps that I have been working towards making for a year and a half.

	<TEXT> I don't have an issue with the mention of religion in the songs. I just hate how I show someone music that I think is beautiful and all they can say about it is "sounds like Christian music." I was expecting "wow thats really cool sounding and really beautiful." I guess I just don't like when people can't hear the beauty in music or in art and only look at it from a lyric standpoint. All they hear is the word god in a song and assume AVA is a christian rock band that you'd hear in church. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If im reading this right than I think he is saying/ inferring that we arent gonna get a full game once so ever when it is released as a "full game." We are gonna get a very bare and boring version that is decently polished. And then they are gonna add free DLC's that will include the story game mode and soccer gamemode etc. So essentially they are finding a way to release a half completed game as full release as it sounds. Idk why they just cant hire a lot more developers if it takes them so long to add stuff to the game.  </TEXT>
