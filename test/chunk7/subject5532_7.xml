	<TEXT> Hi,
Hoping someone can shed some light on this. Whenever I have friends playing Overwatch, I've previously been able to click on their name in the social tab of the game and press 'Join Game' to either spectate until a spot is available or start playing. Recently, this button has disappeared from Overwatch. Similarly, if I view their Gamercard, the Play-Join Game button is greyed out?
Would anyone have idea why? Have already checked NAT type, it's open </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, did get a bit defensive and probably shouldn't have.


What I'm trying to say is, often people would care if it's better value or they can get more out of a PC. People like having an Xbox that just is what it is, and works. Besides all of the advantages of a PC, you still have to do things like figure out which comp can play what game, check sys reqs etc. Plus PCs don't usually live in the living room permanently plugged into a TV, and people like that too.  


What I'm to get at is that despite the PC is, as you say, objectively better value, more worthwhile and you generally get more from it, people like the convenience, the ease (even if compared to a PC that ease is less important or evident, it's still there) and it has the "It just works" mentality with it. Despite them being more like PCs, they still have a console vibe and the accessibility and ease that people invented consoles for in the first place. Objectively, is it the best move for the consumer? No, but that's never stopped people before and it won't no. Consoles have these features above attached to them that have always sold consoles, and will for a while IMO. 


Obviously perhaps for people like you, or even me, a PC will be the option we choose, but I still think loads of people will buy the Scorpio, or even the S. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude. There are people in the world who don't even know things like PC part picker exist. Like seriously, how many people stroll to a store and just buy an Xbox or ps4 because they know it'll work and it's a gaming console and that's that. Millions! Literally millions! If you're one of the people that know how to make a PC, great. And if you know, then I doubt your friends wouldn't know either. Because you're clued in to it, and so are you friends, which is fine and understandable.




However, there are so many people who aren't. So many people who simply don't care. So many people who know how to do it but don't want to go to the trouble of doing it, even if the trouble is a few days more work than going down to the store! That's that, and that will always be the case. People will pay for work to be done for them, whether they can or can't do it themselves anyway.  </TEXT>

Just because everyone on this subreddit might be able to if pushed doesn't mean that the general public's Xbox owners could.  </TEXT>

I'd say it's best to wait till the Spidey game is out though. It could still be crap, and you may as well wait until reviews are out so you know you're not 'wasting' your money. </TEXT>
