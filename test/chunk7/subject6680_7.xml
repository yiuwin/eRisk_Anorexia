	<TEXT>  'There is no way on board to put someone back in suspension' is inconsistent with 'I'm on a round trip (and will therefore need to be put back in suspension)'. They contradict each other. Plot Hole.

Nope, they put her back in hibernation on the destination planet. Nothing alludes to the fact that the destination planet has not been terra-formed and buildings with science labs already available when they get there, either built by robots send earlier or humans send earlier. Nothing in this movie says that they are going to be the first to set foot on it. So then, she will spend a month on Home2, ask people how life is, then when it was time to return to earth go to one of the specialized science labs with all the equipment needed to properly hibernate a person. No contradiction at all.

As for your suggestions about Jim having tried everything, as far as Jim is concerned and limited by what he knows (nobody knows exactly what they don't know) he did try everything. There is no need to have in depth datasheets and construction manuals for everything on the ship, firstly because most of it will be proprietary and secondly because these manuals and know how will be stored at the construction and maintenance factories.

 They have also declared that their cryopods never malfunction. Yet they did, twice in one trip!! Maybe beleive the hype a little less. :-)

This was the first time, so in actual fact when Jim boarded the ship the statement that no pod malfunctioned was technically correct. Up to that point in time there never was any failure made known. Perhaps there were and they kept it silent because nobody would be all that concerned that their great, great, great uncle Jim died on a space trip 180 years ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agree, and I think that when applying to go on this trip you need to go through a couple of extensive medicals that include psycho analyses to weed out the crazies. Given how thorough and quickly one of this pods can give an analysis on a person's health, the only thing that could cause medical emergencies are if people fell of high floors and broke a bone, or cut themselves with sharp objects. All really stuff that you can not plan for but that should not really happen. and if it did, it would be on the scale of perhaps 1 person per 20 trips or so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great point, that could have worked. Alternating with five years in, five years out, would have caused them to age by 45 years. Assuming they are currently 30 years old, they would have been 75 upon arrival.

So, to be safe not to die from old age, they could not really spent a significant amount of time with both outside, perhaps a couple of months max at a time.

The thing is however that the older you get the less important death becomes, as you realize that living consists out of a lot more than just not dying...   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Difficult to say, I think she realized that by Jim waking her up, he *accidentally* saved her life when the ship started going crazy.

Then when she faced the possible reality of having to be alone on the ship for decades to come, due to Jim not surviving opening the door from the outside; she came to the realization of what he possibly went through in the first year. This makes forgiving him easier.

Furthermore once they started creating a completely new life on the ship together, having access to the best food, drink and entertainment (via the master pass override), it is not so easy to just say goodbye knowing that your partner of 30+ years will have to now live in utter solitude, suffer at the end of their life and die all alone.

In Aurora's back story it is also mentioned that she is a bit of loner that seeks to find something to fill that empty void on the inside.  Who knows, perhaps loving and living with Jim filled the void. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only professions that will have a direct influence that cannot be bought at a guild trader, on how you fight monsters are alchemy and provisioning. This is because alchemy enhance duration and power of potions you drink and provisioning enhance duration of meals and drink. 

All other profession's end products can be bought from other players or guild traders. Although the most powerful sets are very expensive. 

I use ESO+ only for the crafting bag. It would be impossible for me to play the game without it.  If you have it, all crafting materials from all profesions gathered by all your characters go into this endless bag. You can farm and mine all day long without adding one item to your inventory.

Sometimes just copying a Steam directory over directly doesn't even work. You need to use the Steam backup to DVD functionality to share a game with a friend. This friend then needs to import the backup Steam files into his Steam library. This importing encrypts the files again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like the other well informed player mentioned, it is very important to ensure that you level all your class skills to 50 while still leveling. 

You level a skill line by just having that skill on your bar, you don't even have to use it (of course putting a semi useful skill from each of your class skills will be beneficial). This way when another patch with nerfs and buffs come around you will be ready. 

Don't worry to much about doing crazy damage on your way to level 50. It is more important to get there with all class skill trees, bow and duel wield at level 50. Even if you felt a bit gimped by the skills on your bar. 

Remember to switch to  the bar with the skills most in need of a level up before handing in a quest as the xp from this is huge and will boost all skill trees represented on the current active bar. 

The real journey starts once you hit level 50. By being level 50 and around CP 100 you should now have all required skills maxed out and morphed. Now the real fun starts as you grind to CP 160 and max your crafting skills. 

Once you hit CP 160 you can now wear the highest level armor and use the most powerful weapons in the game. At this point you will have a good understanding of the class and what you enjoy. At this point you will start to gear specifically for your skill set and role. 

The real game (at least the most MMO portion) starts only once you hit CP 160

tl;dr get all skill lines to level 50 before the actual game starts once you hit CP 160 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agree with you, however 9 out of 10 times you don't even get the opportunity to prove yourself due to getting removed from the group and ending up with a 15 minute debuf.

Thing is for most of us, time is a precious resource. Getting this debuf means that the person may end up not running any dungeon (normal or vet) that evening.

It is bad for the game, and can be easily resolved.

	<TITLE> With regards to dungeons and queuing pretty please: </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-12 09:47:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Implement either of the following:

1. Make the DEFAULT dungeon that one may queue for normal mode until at least CP 160.
2. Remove the option to queue for veteran dungeons until at least CP 160.
3. Remove the debuff of 15 minutes when kicked within the first 30 seconds of the group being ported into the dungeon.

I understand that CP 160+ players already did the leg work to get decent gear and CP levels, I really don't blame them for kicking CP 20 players. 

However, I have a problem with the implementation of this. Veteran dungeons are like heroic and mythic dungeons in WoW. In WoW you must be a minimum item level even to queue for heroic or mythic dungeons. This ensures that when pugging a dungeon high level players do not need to carry low level players.

The problem in ESO is that at soon as you hit level 50 CP 0 the DEFAULT when queuing for dungeons is veteran difficulty. Now there is no way a 4 CP 0 players can clear these dungeons in a reasonable amount of time. If they group up with three CP 200 players and they are DPS, I seriously doubt they will even do 5% of the total damage, and even worse, some bosses will just sneeze at them and they will die from it. Also due to the low CP level they are not familiar with the tactics in the boss fights which can cause the whole group to wipe over and over.

So, the CP 200 players (well within their right) kick the newly dinged CP 0 player when entering the dungeon, but now the CP 0 player sits with a 15 minute debuff. 

So hence the above recommendations that should be a QoL improvement for all. </TEXT>

So, how then is it possible for one electron with a negative charge of (just using an example here) -1 when a proton which is much, much larger needs 3 thingies inside it (quarks) to give it the same power but with an opposite charge of +1. 

Yet a positron which I then assume would also be a point particle the size of an electron is able to have a charge of +1. 

Or do you need to put several electrons together before they have the same electrical potential as one proton?

Also, you mention angular momentum as a fixed attribute. What exactly are the protons spinning around?

P.S. Thanks for the Star Wars reference in your answer :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all

Subject has a couple of questions but they all (at least according to my limited knowledge) refer to the same thing.
What exactly is negative and what is positive at a fundamental level?

Why is an electron negative and an anti-electron positive, what exactly determines this.

Is it impossible for something else to exist that is not negative, positive or neutral?

What is charge? What exactly makes an electron to have a negative charge and a proton to have a positive charge? Does charge have a weight? Are there things smaller than an electron inside an electron configured in a certain way that makes it negative? And these things are arranged / move in an opposite direction in an anti-electron (positron) to make it positive?

How can a positron contain the same amount of electrical potential, but it is a point object the same size as an electron, where as a proton, which is very much larger needs three sub particles in order to have the same potential? How is charge saved in the positron? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I am in a metric system country. However most petroleum refineries in my country were build by American engineering houses. All of them used ASME design codes (thus flange ratings of 150 PSI or 600 PSI etcetera) and ASME + API + AWWA materials for, for instance piping isometric drawings.

This resulted that all the drawings used pipe diameter in inch, but pipe length in millimeter. So the refineries use a mixed metric system.

In schools and universities we only use metric though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good day, thanks for your reply, it is much appreciated.

I understand the notion of charge and that charge can be negative or positive.

*But what is charge?* What exactly makes an electron to have a negative charge and a proton to have a positive charge? Does charge have a weight? Are there things smaller than an electron inside an electron configured in a certain way that makes it negative? And these things are arranged / move in an opposite direction in an anti-electron (positron) to make it positive?

Not exactly sure how to express my question.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, the *rate of increase in distance* between two points in space are not limited to the speed of light. it can and does exceed the speed of light.

If we are holding two torches with their back sides to each other so that the lenses point in the opposite direction of each other, and then switch both torches on at the same time.
From this one would seem to imply that in one second, the distance between two photons , one from each torch, are now 2 x Speed of light traveled in one second apart from each other. Hence they traveled faster than the speed of light But assuming that would be incorrect, what did actually happen was that the rate of increase in distance was twice the speed of light; each photon still only traveled at the speed of light, and Einstein's special relativity still holds. Photons and anything else that want to move at the speed of light are very special in the sense that they have no initial reference frame where they were stationary. As soon as they come into existence they are traveling at exactly the speed of light, no acceleration needed.
When you look up at a very distant star, the photon left that star billions of light years ago according to your frame of reference, but for the photon's frame of reference the time needed to travel from the star to your eye was instantaneous - 0 seconds. Time does not exist for photons. Weird right.
One should be really careful when talking about stuff moving at the speed of light as it is extremely easily to find oneself in a myriad of these faster than light paradoxes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Right? If two people move opposite directions at the speed of light, what is the distance between them after an hour?

They can't it is impossible. You will need an infinite force to get any object with mass to go at the speed of light.

If we change your statement slightly by saying we are holding two torches with their back sides to each other so that the lenses point in  the opposite direction of each other, and then switch both torches on at the same time.

	<TEXT> You don't need it to be able to play the game. It is a *nice to have*. 

All MMOs require a huge time commitment, if you personally don't feel like putting in the time, to grind the gold in game for it (should take a couple of weeks max), then pay real world money to bypass this time sink.

Personally I don't get it why people are more than willing to *pay* in order not to play the game...

Also, the manors in the game should be hard to get and or expensive to buy with real money. If it was easy and cheap, they would have no value and there would be no sense of accomplishment in having one. </TEXT>
