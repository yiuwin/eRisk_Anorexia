	<TEXT> Whether or not this is true, I think it is important for us to remind ourselves to always be skeptical of the idea of the "woke" musician, obviously you should never just assume that someone is an abuser or that they are bad people, but you should also never rule out the possibility that the people who present themselves as progressive have some skeletons in the closet themselves. 

As for the swastika, while that is a moronic thing to do, I can imagine that this was just him acting like an edgy idiot, so I don't really have strong feelings about it since it happened 6 years ago, like I don't think that is enough evidence to suggest that he is an actual anti-semite, unless it is part of a bigger picture obviously.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that is an interesting perspective, I have to think more about it, but I think he makes some fair points. My biggest issue with South Park personally is that it is really hit or miss, because for every funny episode they have one that just feels obtuse in a way that they can only get away with because that is what people have come to except from the show.

For what it is worth though, I don't think you should ever take any comedy shows too seriously, because they are entertainment before anything else.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I think they were just trying to say that there is a market for shows and movies about black people and created by black people that can be both popular amongst the general public and with critics as well. 

Which is actually a point that needs to be made, as those are artforms that requires funding, and because of that also faith from studios. By proving to studios that movies like Get Out or shows like Atlanta can be successful, we're also giving them incentive to fund more projects like it.

Also, there are actually still a lot of people who doubt the abilities of people based on their gender, sexuality and race, so there is nothing wrong with contradicting that narrative.  </TEXT>

Nobody is saying that, Rotten Tomatoes is a review aggregate, so something getting over 90% just means that 90% of critics accounted for on the site reviewed it favourably. So even if the average score is around 7/10, it can still get over 80% on RT.

Also the point the tweet was trying to make wasn't that only black people can create meaningful and great shows and films, but just when given the opportunity black people are also able to make something great.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Potentially, but I also think it is likely that they cheered as a gut reaction to something positive, without getting the time to think about the implications of it. This is a studio audience we're talking about, they're supposed to react in these very simple and highly responsive ways, it really isn't a good representation of the political landscape or the current state of knowledge among the general population. 

However, people might still very well be misinformed and lack substantial knowledge about current affairs, but the reaction of the studio audience to a late-night talk show isn't really indicative of anything. So we should never use them to win an argument one way or the other, because if you have legs to stand on you'll find better sources to use.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a girl like this in my class, she always gets Cs because she never starts studying before really late in the semester, yet she always freaks out when she realises that she won't do well and acts shocked when she get mediocre grades. Like if you're okay with average grades than that is fine, but don't bitch and moan about not doing as well as you want to when you're too lazy to put in the work.

	<TEXT> Like I already said, even if someone breaks the law doesn't mean that they did something wrong, and even if they did it should still be dealt with in such a way that benefits as many people as possible. Punishing people for the sake of punishing them is unproductive, ineffective, and a glaring sign of incompetence on the behalf of the people in power. 

For an instance if we use the drug analogy, why wouldn't you send drug addicts to rehab instead of giving them to excessively long jail sentences? What is more important here, the rule of law and the principle of it, or making policies and laws that help out as many people as possible? 

Also what is even the point of saying you want a discussion if you just want to tell everyone that they are wrong if they disagree with you?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I am a very right winged person. I believe America has our laws and if you come here illegally you aren't respecting them. That's like walking up to someone and punching them in the face and then asking them if you can live with them. It's not right

See the problem is that you are dehumanising undocumented immigrants and implying that they are dangerous people who all should be punished equally. That however isn't really an helpful or productive way to talk about a complex issue, it is piece of rhetoric you use to push people into a corner by implying that people who don't have same opinions as you support punching people in the face. On top of that there are other opitions besides saying that we should just let all illegal immigrants stay or blindly deport all of them.

So while illegal immigration is a problem, I also don't buy into far-right rhetoric that dehumanise large groups of people, and who talk about human beings as if they  are not entitled to fair treatment, dignity, and fundamental human rights.

On top of that there are more than one way to deal with the issue, people who live in a country illegally but who haven't commited felonies while in the country should be allowed to become legal citizen. Because there is nothing in it for you to throw them out, beyond satisfying your ideology. 

This idea of "it is not right" works nice for a slogan, but it is not at all good for policies. You talk about dealing, but anyone  remotely competent knows that there has to be more that one way to deal with drug problems. Because throwing everyone in jail is not at all an effective or helpful method to solve a societal problem. </TEXT>
