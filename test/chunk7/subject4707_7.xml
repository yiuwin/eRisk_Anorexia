	<TEXT> I started the 5x5 SL challenge on the app (iPhone). It asked me what previous weightlifting experience I had. When I clicked "none" it preselected me a starting weight for each exercise, deadlift has always been 2.5kg under the squat. I could probably do more but since they do fairly similar muscles, and I do pull-ups as accessories, I don't really need to up the deadlift weight currently! 

Think my forms slightly off as I find deadlift at 72.5kg a lot harder than 75kg squats! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah exactly! Unfortunately with any mental illness, it isn't an exact science. Theres no ironclad cure, theres no shortcuts or emergency medication. Some people come out better than others, and im lucky for that. But because i came out better than others, i have to help spread that word around now. I need to give back the luck i received! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Best advice i can give about the eyes is see atleast 3 different consultants. The surgeon is the dealbreaker, meet them, talk to them. Then decide what you want to do!

You've got this man, i expect to see a post from you in the future when you're finally where you want to be! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah! I mean i hadn't worked out like, at all. So i still had the same (around about) muscle mass in the second picture than in the first. I had the gut but i had next to no weight other than that. Can see how it looks that way though! </TEXT>
