no it's not.
Ai and VI are still restricted to the very wealthy and the military in the shows verse.
most of the ppl that speak gobbledgook cant afford this

the shows language is actually reasonably well done.
267 ears ovver 130 of it in the belt  is more thna enough time for a simple few words to be  worked into a complelty whole new syntax and expressive form of  linguistics.

hence why you have ords like belta loader  and tre walla

	<TEXT> Also to do with the polling areas.

Essentanl reporting is EMC.
who get  it run out by   uni kids and others in sydney and melb.
The areas they poll don't stray to far from  the uni's   which are generally inner sydney  further right leaning voters.

The other 50 percent of the polling is performed over phone satisfaction polling aggregates.

Who is home between  9am-4pm.
Usually, older  people who are retired that lean more conservative and never change their  vote habits   even if their member kicked a baby in the eye socket in front of them.

And stay at home parents who are generally more comfy. it's them and the jobless ppl who have time to conduct the poll that make up the   swing to the left.

If you called the phones after dinner time you would probably see a larger swing to labor as all the working class ppl are home by then.

	<TEXT> Uhmm what?
$1,900 million in fuel subsidies
$550 million in reduced tax payments for the gas industrys production of condensate
$368 million on tax write-offs for capital works
$330 million on deductions for exploration and prospecting
$312 million in accelerated depreciation write-offs.



also for coal generators.

Aggregate subsidies to generation
from coal include the costs of the
Commonwealths Carbon Capture
and Storage Flagships and similar
programs at the state level. The cost of
state programs that are directed at coal
mining and that may indirectly benefit
the electricity generation sector has been
prorated according to the share of coal
that is consumed domestically.3
 Subsidies
to coal generation accounted for around
$119 million or 4 per cent of aggregate
subsidies in 2013-14. 


HOWEVER.
ill say right now.
Solar get's way more subsidys right now,but that's against the  solar circlejerk so i can't post that without getting downvoted.

But the above proves that ur comment is factually incorrect that generators dont receive subsidys

	<TEXT> Exactly as i said above.

When someone like andrew bolt.
calls a  triple amputee on his show.
a waste to society and there are plenty of jobs he could be doing.
stop being a waste on us the tax payer  and he is a good for nothing.
Then you have a right to go.
What an asshole.
i mean it's australia.
Where ppl can call the PM a dickhead to his face and not face repercussions.

Don't however say stuff like.

"Gillard was a cunt"  Instead say something like "gillars policy was some whack shit yo" 

If the public figure you are commenting on  is being an asshole then  they have earned the right to be called that.

Don't say stupid shit like Ray hadley likes to fuck twinks  when you have no grounds to back it up.
this just derails the debate.

What i would rather see the mods concentrate on is,banning or calling out users who use this sub as a platform for there biased views.

let's just say one user,And we all know who it is.
Pretty much just says rampant nonsensical garbage in defence of a certain non renewable industry.  with next to nothing to back it up.
then you have like 1.2 trillion comments on the dude's lack of evidence.
The users entitled to comment on the issue at hand.

	<TEXT> My thoughts.

Public figures are exempt from the rules.  in so far.

As when someone like andrew bolt like several weeks ago.
Calls a person on the DSP  a waste on society's balance books and to stop being lazy and.

Or when gerry harvey sues a charity for the donation he gave them money to  when he finds out they support homeless causes..that's called just being a wanker.

Then you have a right to go.bolt ur a dickhead.
But don't abuse the public figure just cause who they are.

Only when they are being an aahole call them that.

Like saying gillard was a bitch.
with nothing to back up ur stance.
Don't do that.


I mean did we see anyone lose there mind  when that dude called  tonez a dickhead.
No.
Cause being a public figure you have to deal with this.


do not,however abuse other users.


But the mods need to not take it so far.

I should be alowed to say that's an idiotic view to have  without eating a 3 day ban.
this is a messaging platform after all whats the point if you can't type ur opionions.


Lately the subs gotten a bit too dandy,Where  someone will post a comment. nothing to back up the wild claim.  you call that comment stupid  and you get banned for "ATTACKING THE USER"  that's not an attack.
 if someone says that the earths flat  and i say that's just stupid that is not bannable offense </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ahh okay.

Well shes wrong on both counts then.
We don't legally have free speech here.
The only legaly protected form of speech is polictical speech.
You can call a member of parliment watever the fuck you want.
aslo you are not allowed to be interfered in with ur choices or communications in regards to  voting practices.
Why  they take it really serious on voting day on ppl with pamplets standing closer than 85 metres from a polling station. 

right now the Alt-right here is butthurt.
That  it can't say what it wants 2 (see being a racist cunt).
Im like what could you not say before that  you will be able to iff we amend section 18c of the constitution?

They are butthurt that they can't be racist dickheads  anymore.
The right wing here has turned into the US style.
they think "free speech is just for them"  
They can tell the immigrants to get a job but you say anything back to them they think ur trying to limit their speech

	<TEXT> well  2 guesses  who.

ill give you a hint.
He's now an ambassador to the us.

The whole schemes corrupt as hell.
5 of the board members of indue are all LNP members 

The Liberal National Party (LNP) Welfare Card programme is really a LNP rort for the benefit of the Liberal and National Parties and their members, donors and supporters. Indue Pty Ltd, the corporation awarded the contract to manage the Welfare Card programme and to operate its underlying systems, is a corporation owned by Liberal
and National Party members and that donates to various Liberal and National Party branches around Australia.
The former chairman of Indue is none other than former LNP MP Larry Anthony who is the son of former Liberal
Country Party Deputy Prime Minister Doug Anthony.

just look up the board of directors.
it's the most blatant corruption we have had in decades

i think they get like 3600 dollars per a person they get onto the system.
so of course they want to  make the card sound like it's needed so they get more customers  </TEXT>
