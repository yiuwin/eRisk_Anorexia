	<TEXT> He certainly has had more success at his sport than any other Newfoundlander has had at their respective sport. He was the leader of a gold medal Olympic team, the only Olympic gold ever for someone in our province, so it's pretty hard to not give him credit for that.

However, I'd argue that curling isn't really a good measure of general athleticism. Curling involves some very niche skills/abilities that aren't widely transferable to or valuable in other other sports. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  ball has his issues but holy crap i wish there was some of this activist spirit stirred up in newfoundlanders before oil went to shit and it was too late.

	<TEXT> yeah it didn't even cross my mind once. i thought she'd fall out dead. it was such an amazing moment, and one that i feel they've been crafting for a long time. they've downplayed walkers all season, didn't really have them play any role otherwise in the episode. and we were more caught up in whether or not she actually took the pill for so long that we forgot what would happen to her after she died. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not that things haven't gotten better since Confederation - they obviously have. It's that Newfoundland still lags so far behind the rest of Canada in so many ways even now 68 years later. For any Newfoundlander who has traveled and experienced what the rest of Canada is actually like that's the thing that makes Confederation seem like such a bad deal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i hear you. newfoundlanders spend their money on the dumbest things. my neighbours here have three ski doos, two quads, a pickup, an suv, and two cars. for two people! that's close to $200,000 of the worst spending i've ever seen. i just wonder what would happen if newfoundlanders spent money on their local economy instead of just sending their cash off to the mainland. but it's all about appearances, not about investing. and housing prices! rural newfoundland is full of empty houses because people want st. john's (or toronto) prices for them. rural newfoundland is dying because all the young people are moving away, but you could attract lots of young people here with an opportunity to own a house at a reasonable price. there's big picture reasons why the economy sucks (muskrat falls, mismanagement of the fishery), but the individual consumer choices are just as big of a problem, imho. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> for the most part western canada only gets beautiful once you reach the very western edge of alberta. that's less than half of western canada if you ask me. (although grasslands national park in southern saskatchewan is an absolute gem). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Carol feels guilty that her actions have caused so many deaths. Now her inaction - refusing to take Ben with her - has indirectly caused his death. I think this will help her realize that disappearing will cause just as many deaths as fighting, but that at least if she fights she can decide who lives and who dies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i assumed it was meant to show us that he is being watched. and also there was the earlier scene where carol comes across a dead walker on the road, looks all around and doesn't see anything, but then we see a silhouette moving away from the area. they're all being watched, there's no doubt about that.

edit: oh the carol scene was probably richard watching her, but i still think we're meant to think morgan was being watched. </TEXT>
