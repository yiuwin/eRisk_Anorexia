	<TEXT> To be honest, I'm not really trying that hard to convince people on Reddit to do that. I guess I assumed that there would be people that would offer some advice without having to be thoroughly convinced that they should help me. 

I want to become better at manipulation because I see it as one of the tools I have available to me in social situations. It will become more useful to me if I better learn how to use it.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Efreeti warlock patron </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-19 06:20:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Your patron is a powerful genie from the elemental plane of fire.
Most of your power manifests in flame, but you have some control over the other elements as well. 

Expanded spell list 

1st level: Burning hands, feather fall
2nd level: flame blade, scorching Ray 
3rd level: fire ball, gaseous form
4th level: conjure minor elementals, wall of fire
5th level:contact other plane, flame strike.

Fiery altercation 
At first level, you can choose to change the damage type of any cantrip you cast, to fire. 
Also, any time you reduce a creature's hit points to zero using fire damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to your charisma modifier + your warlock level. 

Level 6
Chains of the Efreeti 
Using your action,choose a target with 60 feet that you can see. Chains of hot metal shoot up from the ground and grab hold of the target. If the target is huge or smaller, they are considered grappled. The target takes 1d6 fire damage. On the start of the target's next turn they take 1d6 fire damage and must make a check to escape the grapple against your warlock spell save DC. If they succeed, they break the chains and are free. If they fail, the chains pull them to the ground. They are considered prone. On the start of every turn that they are still trapped, they take 1d6 fire damage and must repeat the saving throw. If this affect has persisted for 3 rounds and the target has still not escaped, the chains melt away.


Level 14
Cast into the conflagration. 
You can use your action to tap a creature and teleport them to the sea of flame in the elemental plane of fire. The target takes 10d10 fire damage. The creature reappears in one round. Any flammable clothing or items that the creature was wearing or carrying are either incinerated or severely burned. If the creature dies from the damage they are completely incinerated. They will return as a pile of ash. 
Once you have used this ability you must take a long rest before you can use it again. 


Note: I know that giving warlocks access to a spell such as "conjure minor elementals" is rarely a good idea. My plan to avoid them abusing this is to have the different batches of elementals summoned dislike each other. And immediately break out into battle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will be running a one off campaign for four players within the week and I need a cool idea. The characters will be a half elf warlock of an efreeti, a thri-kreen psion, an elf wizard bent on assassinating a sorcerer king and stealing his throne, and one other who has yet to be identified. Right now I'm planning to have them start at 4th level but that is changeable. Any help is appreciated.  </TEXT>
