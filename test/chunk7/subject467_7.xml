It turns out I had got home very drunk and (before passing out in the bathroom) stumbled in to my room where my girlfriend and best friends were having a sleepover. Knocked a hammer off my shelf narrowly missing one of them, got into bed, was promptly sick and then put upstairs in the bathroom. Then came back downstairs naked a couple of times covered in sick, put back upstairs each time until I hit my head on the sink and passed out after the worst of it was cleaned up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went there with friends (three guys, four girls) for a holiday 6 years ago. Most of the holiday was really good and standard fare but the guys out there really do take a liking to blonde girls in particular. 

Anyway, one night we decide to go out big in Bodiam so we go to a resteraunt and end up making friends with the manager who then takes us to one of the clubs. We walk in and instantly he becomes this sleezy slimeball. The club was a big concert style venue with easily about 500-700 people there. And out of that maybe 10 girls. The bar areas weren't too bad but whenever we tried to go dance with the girls we had to set up a perimeter to stop them from getting molested by 10 sweaty turkish boys. 

It sounds like I'm exaggerating when in fact it was probably a lot worse than I'm making out: those girls were really annoying for the whole holiday and one of them was my ex at the time. so I spent most of that evening stealing alcohol because it was too expensive and climbing on stage when a foam cannon came out. But that's a story for another time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know what you mean and am I being the same situation: no broadcast tv. However I went to visit an old friend recently and after a night drinking and smoking we slump in front of the TV. He doesn't have the same setup as me and just has cable. We switch on one of the channels and Terminator 2 is on. We were so funking estate as it's one of our shared favourite movies. Even though I could have downloaded it within 5 minutes on my phone or something, it was so much more satisfying watching the second half with some ad breaks just because it felt serendipitous.  </TEXT>

Then a few months later I got bored and kind of neglected a lot of my work that was less interesting. Instead of firing me (they should have) they hired someone else to do what I had stopped doing and had me take on the editing and graphics (interesting part) as my full time job. 

Still don't know why they didn't fire me and keep things as they were.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really not liking the indicators for pinned and retreating too. In CoH1 you had a big exclamation mark so you know what's retreating and what to hunt down if need be.

The pin indicators IMO are terrible in the new version; a little icon in the corner of a unit's badge which is barely visible at a glance. This has to be a step back from the whole badge in CoH 1 flashing yellow or red so you can instantly see which units are pinned. As such an integral early game mechanic I'm surprised they designed it like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't do everything. 

This may not apply to everyone I know the same way but in the last couple of years I've realised that I can't do every single thing I want to do. Some things simply do not allow others. For example: I would love to travel the world and do odd jobs here and there. However, I really enjoy my job and want an awesome career, also I would like a family, dog, motorcycle, sail boat and of course to live in a hot country. One or two of these things may be possible with focus and dedication but at the cost of the rest (unless I come into a huge amount of money suddenly). 

Choose what matters most and stick with it. You can't do everything.  </TEXT>
