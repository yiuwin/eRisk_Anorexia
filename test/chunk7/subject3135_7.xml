	<TEXT> Something similar to that happened to me once.

I was driving home with my window down after my former friend essentially hurt me in the most personal way possible and by the time I got to the first stop light, I was full on sobbing. I was in no condition to be driving, but there was a car ahead of me at the light that was preventing me from turning into the nearest parking lot. The woman driving in the car next to mine rolled down her window and kindly asked if I needed any help. I was so embarrassed that I had be caught in such a vulnerable position in public, but I told her that I would be okay. Then she said that she would pray for me. The light changed and she drove off while I turned into the parking lot.

The difference between the hurt that my best friend caused me and the absolute kindness of a stranger has always stuck with me. I'm not even religious, but I'm always striving to be as helping and compassionate as that woman. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think something fishy is going on with Caitlin since we never saw her make the choice to return to Team Flash.

Honestly, I just want to see her have a greater role in the show either as a part of the team or as a villan. This season didn't really focus on her, just her romance with Jay. I'd love some character development! I think we've gotten maybe 1 throwaway line about her family, but I want more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd really love to see Luisa back and involved with her family. She needs a redemption arc, and if they can redeem Petra, then they can redeem Luisa. (But we're all agreed, Magda is the worst, right?) I'd love to see Luisa get to know her nieces and nephew, and be suspicious of Derek.

Some of my favorite scenes of Luisa are when she is searching for her mother, thinking she's alive, and then finding out that she really is dead, so I'd really love for the writers to continue to develop her story. </TEXT>

I think the twins were the worst part of the episode. I'd much rather have more Lina backstory or Rafael and Derek scenes than them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was attempting to flirt with my friend over text. He told me he was watching salmon fishing in the yemen. I wanted to appear as cool and as hipster as he was, so I text back that that was so cool and interesting! Did he find a live steam online where he could really watch people in yemen salmon fishing?? No. Turns out he was watching the movie, Salmon Fishing In The Yemen, and that he doesn't like the concept of people fishing for sport and not survival. I quickly backtracked and agreed with him all while feeling like the biggest idiot in the world.

Still can't look at that movie without blushing and feeling extremely embarrassed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's how I feel too. 

Abuelo Mateo is practically the perfect devoted husband and father from what we've seen so far. He gets disowned from his rich family to marry Alba. He moves to the US with his new expectant wife. He helped Alba adjust to their new home and create new traditions to make her feel more comfortable. He's described as the love of Alba's life and Alba has even said that she never dated after him because she didn't want to dishonor him after all that he did for her.

And now we're supposed to root for Juan Pablo Segura and his curse?

I'd much rather have the priest back.

Edit: And his mustache really bothers me. /end rant </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And yes, Rolegio did tell Xo to have an abortion. That's one of the reasons Liliana (glam-ma) and Xo didn't get along because Rolegio told Liliana that Xo was hiding her child from him when really Rolegio told Xo to have an abortion.

I don't know if it's mentioned how long he is married to Melissa (his second wife), but it can't be any longer than 9 years. In the Scientology video, which is 10 years old, Rolegio is still married to Luciana. So during that 10 years, he divorces Luciana, marries Melissa, and is divorced to Melissa by season 1 of JtV, which was last year. So I think he did help raise the twins as their step-father because they would be a lot younger if they were Rolegio's children. </TEXT>
