	<TEXT> I can say that MEMRI has been doing this for a long time, and I have never heard that they have falsely translated the subtitles.
So by inductive reasoning, yeah, you can be pretty confident that the subtitles are accurate.

I just thought that I should get a second opinion. (they do have an impressive history of accuracy to be fair)

Do keep in mind, however, that it is impossible to translate from one language to another and perfectly convey the original meaning, even if the two languages are linguistically related.

I can live with that
