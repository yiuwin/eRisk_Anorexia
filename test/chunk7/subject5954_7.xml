	<TEXT> Me and my friends would like to go to one of the secret bars/restaurants behind a vending machine/telephone booth etc. But I'm reading that most of them have crowded lines in front of them and need reservations, I'm fine with a reservation but I don't like the fact that there would be a line, not very secret you know! </TEXT>
