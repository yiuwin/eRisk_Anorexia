	<TEXT> Oh goodness, I wouldn't want her to go to the wedding in her state. It is such a horrible environment for a recovering anorexic. The sit-down dinner surrounded by friends and strangers watching you eat, cake being passed around, everyone in complimenting each other on their appearance... I wouldn't dream of asking her to be there -- especially not as a bridesmaid -- with her condition. Like, my bridesmaids have sent me all their measurements so I can custom order the dress. It would be hell for her. 

I am more worried about letting her know that the wedding is happening. Like I said, she doesn't even know I am engaged as far as I know. I left the ball in her court as far as communication goes, and she hasn't passed it so I want to respect that. 

I really just want to know what the lesser of two evils is: get married without her knowledge OR break my word to her and potentially interrupt her recovery to let her know I am getting married.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I [22F] am getting married this summer and one of my closest friends [22F] is in longterm treatment for anorexia. *trigger warning* </TITLE>

	<TEXT> First and foremost, I want to assure you that I understand that my wedding and me aren't the important things in this situation. The only important thing, as I see it, is my friend's health. 

Here the situation: I am getting married to my wonderful fiance after three years together. Our wedding is in August. Save the Date cards have been sent out and almost everything has been arranged. 

Carly is one of my closest friends. We met in 7th grade. In January 2015, Carly was diagnosed with anorexia and was taken to an inpatient treatment center. She has been in treatment since, and she has been transferred multiple times to "the next step up" centers, now several states away. 

When she was first diagnosed, we scheduled phone calls according to her hospital/therapy schedule. This was infrequent but really nice and we'd normally talk for an hour or so. We also would text about things like knitting, funny stories, and life updates (like where our brothers were accepted to college and how Easter was). 

In March of 2016, I went on a diet that snowballed into anorexia (diagnosed in June 2016). I lost dozens of pounds (I was not overweight to start with) and was eating sometimes only 100 calories/day when I was able to admit to myself that I had a problem. I made myself an appointment for an eating disorder specialist, who told me I should go to an inpatient program like Carly. I cried and begged her to let me try outpatient. She did, on a very short trial basis. [p.s I have since nearly recovered and have maintained a stable, healthy-ish weight for a few months. It was a hard, bumpy road but I'm doing well.]

When I got home that day, I texted Carly about my diagnosis and the doctor's recommendation that I go to inpatient. I asked her what it was like. I know now that this was bad, that it could be triggering or upsetting... I wasn't in the right state of mind. I was scared and looking for someone who could tell me it would be ok. I am so sorry that I thought that person could be Carly. 

A few days later, she wrote me a text back that was clearly drafted with her therapist. It said that she is so sorry for my diagnosis and understands how scary it is to be told to go to a hospital but she is not ready to talk about her eating disorder and that she found it triggering for her eating disorder. I felt so horrible, the very last thing I wanted to do was disturb any progress she was making. 

I told her that if she thinks that temporary no communication would be best for her while she recovers, I would understand completely and I know that it wouldn't be personal. She thanked me and told me she would let me know if that was necessary. I left it up to her to initiate contact, and she never has since. I miss her terribly, and I get updates on her condition from mutual friends, but I meant what I said and I understand that for now she needs time for herself to recover. 

Ok now for my question... 

How do I go about addressing my wedding with her? It feels awful to not talk to her about it. I'm not even sure if she heard that I got engaged. Under other circumstances, she'd be a bridesmaid. I feel like I'm excluding her or sending a message that she doesn't matter to me or I forgot about her. It breaks my heart to imagine her feeling like that because of me. I didn't send her a Save The Date, even as a courtesy, because I was worried she'd feel pressure to recover on a timeline. I don't know what to do. When she gets better, what do I say? I don't say anything now, right? 



  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My friend is in treatment for anorexia and because we share the diagnosis she finds talking to me too triggering ATM. I'm getting married in August and want to know how I should address that with her.
