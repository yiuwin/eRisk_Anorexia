	<TEXT> Similar question: "Aren't you self-sabotaging by helping your classmates learn the material?"

Not really. You learn by helping others and discussing the topic, so you gain something, too. If you're often writing about something, you're certainly going to think more deeply about it.

Plus, if *everyone* does a little better and thinks more about how they can reduce their personal waste, then the world would likely be a better place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course. That's not the case for me personally, but I can sympathize:

Having a child is to call another life into existence -- a decision in which that person has no input. That's a hugely impactful decision, and it's really doable only if you think they will (stand a good chance to) have a worthwhile life, for whatever definition of *worthwhile* you think is appropriate. (Which relates to the question that you raised: whether existing is a good thing or not.)

A further complication here is that you have to roughly predict the future society of the lifetime of your child: for example, if you think that the future will be like *1984*, then is it ethical to birth a child into such a future? Oof! Tough question! That's philosophically beyond me.

Note that if you're currently uncertain about where you stand on all this, it's always possible to freeze eggs/sperm to still have the option at a later point when you have resolved these questions. </TEXT>

Let's suppose he's literally the best day trader in the world, and he makes 100% in a year (spoiler: this is really, really, hard. Even if you're super good, it's very hard to cross 20%). Before we even consider the capital gains taxes, the fact that he has to pay his own health insurance, etc., etc., let this resonate: *the most he would make in this case would be 35k*.

He could probably make more money (with no risk, compared to trading) by just working a conventional desk job. He'd probably spend less time at his job, too. Being good at day trading requires a lot of time.

If he performs as well as the market and makes 10% in a year -- most people don't get anywhere near to this -- he would only take home $3500. That's not a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in 2000 or 2001, my brothers and I were having a normal day at home. We're triplets. We never knew our real parents, but we had a guardian. We called him dad all the same. 

We were outside, and had been playing in a mud pit, building mudcastles, playing around, whatever. Eventually we got thirsty and wanted a snack from the kitchen, but dad wouldn't let us inside because we were too dirty. We were totally filthy. If I recall correctly, I had short, bright blonde hair, and it was totally black from being caked with mud. So we tried washing outside with the garden hose. I got to go first, but midway through, the water pressure dropped to nothing and I couldn't wash any further. There was no way that my brothers could clean off the thick layers of mud they'd put on jumping and rolling around in it. We needed a shower.

Our dad realized this, but we were so dirty that going inside would've ruined the carpet and the walls. He was trying to impress his girlfriend back then, so he was trying to be more organized and took his home's cleanliness really seriously. You couldn't even spot dust inside. However, he had one thing that was dirty as hell: his car, which was basically the receiving end of all his vices. He decided (in what was certainly a flash of genius) that it'd be best if we clean off the mud using the showers at the local pool, which was just a few minutes' ride away. 

Let me tell you about his vehicle. This was a real piece of shit. Thirty years old, easily. It went maybe twenty miles an hour, tops, even in our ridiculously flat neighbourhood. There was no way the engine had more than a single horsepower. It smelled of grease and sweat. The tires were basically all flat, except the one good wheel, and the bumper almost non-existent, totally destroyed because he was a pretty careless driver; really clumsy. His vehicle *wobbled* on flat asphalt. Just let that sink in. We got carsick every time.

So anyway, we all bounce into the car -- dad was not exactly a slim guy so he filled up 95% of the space by himself. I sat in the front seat. We pulled out the driveway and had been riding for maybe a minute when we're making a left turn and trying to overtake this red hatchback in front of us, when one of my brothers said that he hadn't yet had his flu shot, and dad turned to look at him, and hushed him and said "I'm driving", and my brother repeated "I need to get my flu shot!" and my dad yelled "I can't juggle that many responsibilities!" and it was in exactly that moment that I realized he had drifted into the wrong lane while overtaking, and we're heading straight for this honking truck! 

I flew fifty feet up into the air, maybe more. I don't know. My brothers soared all over the place. It was ironic to be hit by an ice cream truck -- this was exactly the snack I wanted from the kitchen -- and as I flew past the truck window, I got a good look at the driver. Though I was a pretty small kid -- only three months out of the Dunlop Factory -- I could tell that the driver was neither of legal driving age nor a legal permanent resident of the USA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  3/ Notices how she doesn't bother to listen to Bojack complain about his problems, she's really only using him as a prop to justify her drug use

Nice catch.

 4/ Oh wait, spoiler alert: (literally) he cares whole heck of a lot for some reason.

I think you've gotta give the writers credit there: Todd is sexually torn; evidently he likes Emily but he's not heterosexual. This puts him in a difficult position, and it explains his behavior.

  8/ Like, come on. Todd is just one big joke. Once again, Todd is back at square one.

I also found that unsatisfying, but there was a meta-joke there. Directly after going broke, Todd joked about how convenient that is for storytelling purposes.

----

By and large, I agree that Todd is a dull and weak, two-dimensional character that adds little at the current point in the show. (Note that in Season 3, Todd was moving in and out -- he's getting ready to split and be more independent. That was his character's theme for Season 3: he's finally making more friends and doing his own stuff. Maybe that means he's going evolve as a character. Or that he's going to be written out. That would be a fitting ending to Season 4.) 

I want to remark on one thing though: in the start, *most* characters were two-dimensional. Mr. Peanutbutter was a cardboard cutout if you've ever seen one, and Diane was not exactly a paragon of depth. Those two characters have become really filled out by the arc about their marriage. Princess Carolyn was, in the start, also a plain mix of stereotypes, but got several arcs that filled her out. 

Practically, here's what I think is going on: I suspect that the writers had to start just like any other TV comedy, with fairly two-dimensional characters and one three-dimensional lead. It quickly became apparent that a significant part of the show's appeal is in the real human tragedy that it tells with thoroughly well-developed and complicated characters. Moving more toward that end, the authors have been filling out the characters one-by-one, and Todd is one of the few major characters left to whom this hasn't happened. (Arguably, he's the only one.) 

Todd started out simply as dumb comic relief and as a vehicle to develop/show BoJack's character (we learned a lot about BoJack just from his interactions with Todd). It's tough to plausibly grow a "dumb comic relief" character to loftier heights. Nonetheless, he's come a long way since then, but his character still isn't satisfactory. He doesn't feel human, just kind of farcical. I hope this changes.

----

EDIT: there's probably some significance to Todd being BoJack's best/only friend, and Todd being basically a meaningless shell of a man. Not enough significance to justify the existence of the character, but this seemed noteworthy all the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll answer your budget question in pm. Note that I am not well-versed with materials, so I am hoping to work with someone who can help guide the design process.

Regarding the metal material, I'm expecting that we'll use either stainless steel or silver. Titanium or Palladium would be best, but I've heard those are a little more difficult to commission. I created a 3d sketch and looked at having it done in silver on [ShapeWays](https://www.shapeways.com), which came out below $100.

The logo design is very simple, so I expect it not to be prohibitively difficult/expensive to smith yourself; but if that turns out to be the case, then it would be fine to have it done on ShapeWays and shipped to you for integration with the leather wallet.

Regarding the weight of the logo: right now I'm working with a 4x4cm base area, of which 33% will be occupied by the material. At a thickness of 1mm and a density of 10.5g/cm^3, I think the logo will weigh about 1.42g. I think the challenge here is not going to be accommodating the weight of the logo, but rather the stress that it puts on the leather. If you recommend using a thicker leather on that side: that would be fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the late game, you should aim to be basically population-capped the entire time. Your economy and military should be calibrated such that your economic output matches your military production almost exactly. This means: if you find yourself with 10k wood or 8k food to spare, you're doing something wrong. You're either collecting too many resources (in which case: delete some vills) or not making enough military units. 

To that end, you need to monitor your economy closely: build new lumber camps if your lumberjacks are walking too far, make sure to have lots of farms queued, and make sure you don't have idle vills. In a team game, you should also be trading (make sure that your trade line is efficient!) as you run out of natural gold.

Strong eco management (in practice, this usually means having about half vills -- e.g. 150 vills in a 300 pop game) and simply spamming military units will let you break 1700 pretty quickly. This is especially the case if you boom reasonably well -- i.e. if you hit pop cap before your opponent. If I'm playing as a pocket, I usually boom to about 100 vills by 28 mins, imp at 30, and then start military creation. You have a large (although temporary) advantage if you hit the late game before your opponents. For booming, the fundamental things are:

* Use your town center hotkey to constantly cycle through your TCs and keep up vill production.
* You need 6 farmers to generate enough food to keep up constant vill production in one TC. You need [about 1.5 lumberjacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/2qjo3u/how_many_lumberjacks_are_needed_to_keep_farms/) for every 6 farms. 


In terms of military management, here are a couple pointers:

* Use lots and lots of buildings. You want to be pop capped all the time, so you'll want your military creation to work as rapidly as possible. Ten barracks, fifteen stables, etc. is not overkill at all. Cycle through all the buildings and queue up a couple units in each. You do not want to be creating 15 paladins in one stable and 0 in the others. (A classic mistake is: too many buildings, too many upgrades, not enough army.) 
* You need to know your hotkeys for fast queueing; clicking is way too slow. 
* Set your buildings reasonably close to the front line of the battle so you can reinforce your troops more quickly. Your army should not be running halfway across the map.
* Set your spawn points wisely. You do not want to be creating units and running them into your enemy. (A unit will try to reach its spawn destination, even while being attacked -- it doesn't fight back.) You often see people run a hundred skirmishers, one-by-one, into twenty arbalests. All the skirms die, of course. You want to mass up your spawned units into groups before taking them into battle. This usually means setting a spawn point close to, but behind the front line.
* Bring vills to the front line so you can build castles, military production buildings, towers, walls, etc. as necessary. Garrisoning in a castle is usually a good idea. NB: Usually you can take resources that you've just conquered, as well. This gives you a further edge.
* Watch military idle units. In the course of a long battle, it's very easy to leave units behind (especially trebs, which have to be packed/unpacked). Use the axe symbol on your minimap to see where your military units are.
* Always think about counters. Do not send your paladins into halb armies, etc. If you have lots of gold, backing up your army with a couple of bombard cannons is a good idea. Backing your army up with SO is also a good idea, but it's harder because of friendly fire.
* In line with counters, think about your army composition. You want to be able to counter their counters.
* If possible, raid. If your opponent's eco is not protected by walls, collect 20 hussars/paladins/etc. and send them into your opponent's eco.
* If possible, hit their trade line. A bunch of arbs/skirms/HCs in their trade line will absolutely kill their gold income. A castle drop there is a good idea too.
* Look for unusual ways to win. Can you use onagers (remember, in the expansions, onagers cut wood) to get through to your opponent's base and raid? If you're on a water map and your opponent has no navy, can you make cannon galleons to wreck their shoreline? 

Also, if you're learning, play on normal speed. Learning this stuff on fast is difficult -- it's too overwhelming. </TEXT>

Beyond that, it's commonplace to be able to find flights for $30-50 within Europe, not to mention that within the UK you can take the train very inexpensively from any major city to Edinburgh. If you were willing to travel a few more legs, you could easily have gotten this trip done very cheaply.

 Wiping out our savings wasn't an appealing prospect, but certainly better than being stuck in Istanbul indefinitely!

Yeah, but it's not like all of Europe was on fire? You could've flown to London/Paris/Berlin/etc. for around $100, stayed there for a week or two, enjoyed a vacation, and grabbed a direct flight home afterwards. That would've cost you *much* less than $4k. (You could've still made it to Edinbugh...) I cannot empathize with the response to immediately leave *the entire continent* at any price.  </TEXT>
