	<TEXT> I do like it, I've watched it several times. I can't say it's the best of 2016 because I don't remember all the trailers from this year. This might be sacrilege for some, but, I kind of don't want/need Harrison Ford in this movie. He wont ruin it for me but I just fear that he is being shoe-horned in for nostalgia sake.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, at the base level it's meant to evoke nostalgia for the purposes of this episode, and it does. Beyond that, the specific song choices are well picked for certain parts. I was actually amazed they paid for the rights to use ALL of those songs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if it's a bad thing per se. It makes the format more aggressive, as opposed to 2/3's bouncing off each other. Not only that, but they've designed most of the new aggro creatures to benefit from attacking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, for sure this little guy did work for me too. The only sad part was when he was all I had left and [[Hunt the Weak]] only gets me a trade vs. a 3/2 - and there are a lot of 3/2's. Still, he was definitely an awesome 2-drop.  It's a great feeling when you use energy to do something and realize you don't have to pay any mana.  </TEXT>
