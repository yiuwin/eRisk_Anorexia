I got a call from the school yesterday. Someone had decided not to attend the school. They informed that I was in now. (I'd been first on the waiting list!) I've have never been happier and I can't wait until next year to start over at a new school, doing what I love with like minded people. I just wanted to thank all you guys for the support and encouragement you gave me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is exactly the right place for this, but it seems like it. Anyways, I have been spending the last six months of my life preparing for an audition to an arts school. I practiced so much that the song I was going to do is still ingrained in my brain and I blew my voice out multiple times. I went to the audition and have the best performance of my life. I was feeling so good, even though I almost passed out from anxiety. But then I get my letter today, unsympathetically telling me that I didn't get in. I'm simply not good enough. It hurts so much, I wanted to do this not only for the arts aspect, but to be able to start over at a new school. Far away from my current one where all the guys hate me and the girls seem afraid of me. But now I'm stuck here. I'm pretty sure the only thing keeping me from offing myself is the fact that in on enough meds to kill a fucking elephant. I'm just so angry and sad and I have no output for it and it's eating away at me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Serotonin Syndrome? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-02-03 02:47:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I am currently on 200mg of certraline (Zoloft) a day. Last night I took 375 or so mg of DXM. I felt nothing for a long while and then started feeling really terrible. I got the regular trippy effects, but I also felt like I was going to vomit and I eventually did, multiple times. I was sweating like crazy, my heart was racing and my stomach was making loud gurgling noises. It subsided after about an hour and I went back to enjoying my trip. So I was wondering, is this normal, or is it SS? (Sorry for the bad formatting, I'm posting from my phone.) </TEXT>
