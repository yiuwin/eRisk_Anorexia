	<TEXT> first comment pretty much said it already... but I work in childcare and I make sure to always tell the parents their child is okay before explaining what happened.. then I let them know the call is only to inform them so they don't walk in at home time to find out what happened 4 hours earlier. I also ONLY call if it has something to do with the head... otherwise ... see you at pick up  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How I Nearly Became A Doctor



When I was young I decided I wanted to be a doctor, so I took the entrance exam to go to Medical School.



One of the questions asked was to rearrange the letters *PNEIS* into the name of an important human body part which is most useful when erect.



Those who answered spine are doctors today. </TEXT>

So our space is a 42 square foot garden 
21 feet by 2 feet (but we are going to just space it out a little more then we have too)
Whats your feelings on what goes beside what??? </TEXT>
