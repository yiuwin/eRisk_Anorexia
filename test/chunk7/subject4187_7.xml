	<TEXT> No one in this tread is talking about the part where Zuko saves  Katara from the cheap lighting shot. I thought that part was amazing considering their relationship before (even though she opened up to him after that one mission with Zuko), you can even see how shocked she was. It really speaks well for Zuko's character development.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  lucid dreams can be divided in the categories WILD and DILD, depending if you enter the dream with consciousness or gain it later.

That's a pretty interesting way of thinking of it, I like it!

	<TEXT> I suppose, but I personally think WILD is the intentional act of doing it rather than unintentional. There is another Technique called 'Visual Induction of Lucid Dreams' which is what I think OP accidentally did.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't wanna do it when you first go to bed because earlier in the night your REM stage (where dreaming happens) is at its shortest and it doesn't happen as soon as you go to sleep. REM gets longer as the night goes on, up to around a hour at the latest. 

So you want to wake up in the middle of the night about 6 hours into sleeping, then try WILD. Let us know how it goes. You have done WBTB already and had a LD from it so it shouldn't be too hard to add WILD.
