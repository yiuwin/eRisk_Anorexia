	<TITLE> PWInsider: Update on Donovan Dijak/Kyle O'Reilly   WWE signing Ring of Honor Talent </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-20 05:43:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Donovan Dijak appears to be finishing up here as he's not currently scheduled for anything beyond the February TV taping in Pittsburgh (although one source noted that could change).  That may be a by-product of WWE interest as the word that has been making the rounds the last two weeks is that WWE isn't comfortable offering anyone who was under a ROH deal an offer until they are 60 days out of their ROH deal expiring, obviously because they don't want to be accused of contract tampering.  So, it's a case of talents now having to give notice to ROH, then wait a few months while working the indy scene to see if they will get a WWE offer.  That likely explains why Kyle O'Reilly disappeared after his contract expired on 12/31. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ya know I was the same way. I've been following them since I came back around to watching football about 10 years ago and I've watched nearly every single game since then. This year I thought was gonna be another bad one, then things turned out way different and I saw we had a shot. Now my heart races during the whole game. It's a lingering thing in my head all week that we just need to win ONE more now and we get to the Super Bowl. Less than a week to go and I just can't fucking handle it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's on an elite audio update so I can't link it. Mike Johnson says that he doesn't have full confirmation on it but has heard from multiple sources that ICW will be coming to the WWE Network and an announcement might even be made sometime this week.

He said that the idea might be to have the winner of the WWE UK championship travel to ICW and defend the title there along with maybe OTT and Progress as well, at least until they get their own show up and running in the UK.

The ICW deal is said to be for 2-3 years and that the content will not be toned down and will most likely run only on the on demand portion and not the live stream. </TEXT>
