	<TITLE> How do I retake mountain forts ? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It seems like a good tactic to build my forts to mountains, because it increases defensiveness. But when enemy comes to siege with a large stack, its hard relieving the fort because its a mountain province. If I attack them I get big penalties for attacking mountains. How do you guys actually manage to lift the enemy siege ?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Muslim-Eastern Cavalry. Are they worth it late game ? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> No doubt they rock in the early game. However after a while, cannons and muskets become powerful, while cavalry still costs 2.5 times more than infantry. Even after westernization, muslims keep their %80 cavalry ratio bonus, if it could be considered a bonus. Same for easterns, they get %60. Should they keep more cavalry than westerners even in late game ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems like you expanded pretty well, although I'd focus on europe. Also you seem to have a heck lot of cavalry, don't know if they're that useful late game. But who cares, you did great !

	<TITLE> Mercenary armies vs regulars for hordes </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Mercenaries and no reinforcement cost means you can attack your enemy until they run out of manpower. This i very powerful with the horde although mercenaries cost quite a lot and average hordes are not really rich. Can you give me some advise in this ? Should a horde create regular cavalry armies ? Or perhaps mercs </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you give me a few tips about horde gameplay ? I tried playing timurids and golden horde. As the goldens, I managed to defeat the Muscowy and eat most of their territories but at a certain point they just coalition me and I can't advance, my horde unity goes down. I managed to advance all the way to the bulgaria with timurids by 1520, but a 30-50 years after that and I went down. I couldn't gain enough money to support my armies and enough artillery, as artillery is very important after a while. How did you handle the financial stuff ? </TEXT>
