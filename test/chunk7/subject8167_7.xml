	<TEXT> Ah, yes, the typical Trump supporter, believing all Muslims want to behead and run them over. Judging by your post history, it's pointless to make someone as ignorant and bigoted as you are to see reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 75% of UK citizens aged 24 and younger voted to stay. Residents with higher education were slightly more likely to stay, and those with no formal qualifications were slightly more likely to leave. Also, turnout was low for residents younger than 24, thus if they were more turnout for that demographic, the UK may have remained in the EU.

	<TEXT> Um, to my knowledge the Holy Bible doesn't make reference to the separation of church and state, much less encourage it.
Also, Jesus wasn't all peaceful and understanding as you've led to believe:
If the New Testament account is true, Jesus did commit certain acts of violence. Whip in hand he attacked the merchants in the Temple area, causing a fracas (Matthew 21:12, Mark 11:15-16, Luke 19:45, John 2:15). He caused the death, by drowning, of a herd of swine by allowing demons to purposely enter their bodies (Matthew 8:32, Mark 5:13, Luke 8:33) and destroyed a fig tree for not having fruit out of season (Matthew 21:18-21, Mark 11:13-14).

There are also other passages in the Bible of his mistreatment of Jews and so on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys,
I just finished reading the part about Superman appearing in Gotham, and his motivation to not help still seems unclear to me. He tells Batman "You were right... they're not ready", but wouldn't Superman help regardless if someone is "ready" to be saved or not. Can someone clear this up for me?
Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's actually been extensive research regarding this. Women tend to prefer men with external resources as it shows the ability to provide for them and their offspring. In contrast, men prefer younger, more attractive mates which include a desirable waist-hip ratio, and facial symmetry. 
Of course, though, there have been arguments regarding this theory, such as whether this may be due to women having less social and economic "power" in some societies, thus come to rely on men more for their resources. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Modern society isn't limited to economic growth; It includes the status of women, crime rate (corruption and bribery are much higher than compared to other countries), and international relations (obviously poor with India).

Edit: And of course, a lot of other factors but these were the main ones that came to mind on the subject of Pakistan.

	<TEXT> I completely agree, as a Muslim myself, this law contradicts the purpose of Ramadan, which is, as you've said, about suppressing a **compulsion** to eat. It should not matter AT all whether you see someone else eating or not, as it's part of the purpose, with the whole point being for you to develop your individual self through subduing your desires. These barbaric impositions placed by Muslim countries are what's keeping them from progressing from a primitive society to a modern one. </TEXT>
