this is close to a hoax.. wait till it happens (not in your life) you hypocrites.. indian bpo transferred to the ph due to a more "natural/native sound" of english than the rest of the world, specially indian! talk 'bout "pen pineappo-le appo-le pen-ne".. tsss.. at pra namang napaka tatag tlga ng industriya n yan? eh pag lumubog ang account malamang lubog din ang support. but then again, malabo lumayas yang bpo s pinas dahil lng s "current stand" ng relation ng dalawang bansa.

	<TEXT> I admire people like you who saw the other side of the fence and kept an open mind.

I think I was labeled as a *Yellowtard*/*dilawang elitista* at one point but it doesn't bother me at all. I don't fully oppose the President. There are things that I like what he did like straightening up government officers, ~~the 911   8888 hotline, and the Executive Order for Smoking that protects Non-smokers.~~ I'm a non-smoker but I hope malls/public places would have Smoking areas.

The thing that I really don't like is him is ruining international relationships that most past administrations built. Particularly US, EU, and UN. I some how saw this one coming because of his remarks last elections and this is the reason why I did not vote for him.

EDIT: /u/illuniel clarified some things. Thank you for the information! :D </TEXT>
