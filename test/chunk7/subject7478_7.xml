	<TEXT> An interesting piece on the last stand of a man who was presumed to be dead, but in fact kept fighting till the end: 

"more than 14 years after that brutal fight, in which seven Americans ultimately died, the Air Force says that Chief Slabinski was wrong  and that Sergeant Chapman not only was alive, but also fought on alone for more than an hour after the SEALs had retreated. The Air Force secretary is pushing for a Medal of Honor, the militarys highest award, after new technology used in an examination of videos from aircraft flying overhead helped officials conclude that the sergeant had killed two fighters with Al Qaeda  one in hand-to-hand combat  before dying in an attempt to protect arriving reinforcements." </TEXT>

Lol.

Any proof to these claims?

	<TEXT> Carrion's writing again? I thought he deleted all his blog entries and got out of UFO research. Good to see him writing again.

Some thoughts:

 To the modern day UFO believer, the UFO events of 1947 provide a rationale for their beliefs

Personally, I don't have much interest in the events of 1947. Especially Roswell (there is so much information and misinformation about that case out there that it's hard to come to any conclusion other than confusion). Still, I value Randle's work on the case. 

 documented evidence that defy explanation and give hope to their view that an extraordinary extraterrestrial intelligence is at the root of the phenomenon.

I don't think there is any **one** root source of UFOs. 

I've written this down before: 

 Here are a few confirmed sources of UFOs (IMHO): known/unknown natural phenomena, hoaxes by civilians and militaries (intended to seem like non-human technology), advanced human technologies (secret military aircraft/drones, balloons, satellites), misidentification of prosaic things. If any UFO/UAP is non-human technology (and this has never been confirmed), then we have other theoretical sources: aliens, time travels, inter-dimensional travelers, earth civilizations from an earlier time (a civilization that developed before an earlier extinction event), etc - but this is ALL just speculation. Even with some of the most credible cases (ex: JAL 1628), we can say something weird happened, but we can't say it was non-human technology.

There are some great cases (ex: JAL 1628, Coyne) that are not so easily explained and keep my interest in UFOs piqued. 

The best I can do is take things on a case-by-case basis, and keep a skeptical but open mind.

The Intelligence Community Deception Theory that Carrion (and others) espouse is something that I always keep in consideration. 

 One of the hallmarks of strategic deception is that in order to deceive your enemy, the deception must be universally believed. In other words, a nation that employs strategic deception has to be OK with deceiving their own citizens in the process in order to make the deception appear plausible.

I think the Intelligence Community Deception Theory is something that may have played out in the Betty and Barney Hill case, Rendlesham, Phoenix (maybe), and other "serious" UFO cases. I believe some weird stuff may have occurred to these people (including perhaps seeing what they perceived as a Flying Saucer/Triangle UFO, etc), but that it was some sort of...psychological experiment. 

It's been some time since I read Carrion's Rosetta Deception, but from what I remember, he posits that the 1947 UFO cases, as well as the European Ghost Rockets were simulated UFO encounters conducted by the Intelligence Community to smoke out KGB moles/spies. 

I value the historical research that Carrion has done, but I'm not exactly sure if his theory is correct for the 1947 UFO cases. It might be, but after reading the Rosetta Deception I wasn't convinced that those UFO cases were connected to a KGB mole hunt.

I believe his underlying thesis, Spy agencies and militaries stage UFO events is valid, but it doesn't explain every "serious" UFO case.

Still the Intelligence Community Deception Theory is something to always keep in mind when considering UFO cases.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the show, but if it's an anthology, I won't watch next season.

The main reason I watch the show is the fantastic cast they've assembled season.

	<TEXT> SS: In recent days, we've been hearing that there is a connection between Russian Espionage, the DNC Wikileaks revelations, and their possible intended effect for the 2016 US Presidential elections.

Some people (Edit:~~is~~) are saying that Russian spies hacked the DNC, gave the info to Wikileaks, which then dumped the info to everyone.

Trump has been the indirect winner, and this article looks to see if Trump is a Russian agent (with a legal analysis). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just going through the recent threads on this sub, and damn, so much vitriol against her.

I thought her acting was fine. I could see zero problems with it, so it was confusing see all the hate.

Not only was it fine, but I daresay it was good.

To the people who disliked her portrayal, are you sure your problem is with Skelton? Or looking back now, do you think it was with the writing?

Remember, the actress didn't write her script.

If you think her acting was the problem, then I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.... </TEXT>

Perhaps if it was curly, she would've seemed a lot younger? Maybe with the straight hair, they producers were trying to really emphasize (and portray) that a lot of time has passed?

I thought the episode was fine, but yeah, I probably would've enjoyed it more if it was just 2 distinct time periods, no intermittent splicing. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Richard Dolan: Is he harming Ufology? What are your thoughts? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-08 20:01:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Is anyone else finding it hard to consider Richard Dolan as a credible source/researcher/writer?

(I don't mean this to be a shitpost, and I know that I have the benefit of anonymity but I have to rant)

I've linked to Dolan's material in the [past](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/3m3eup/the_malmstrom_ufo_event_did_it_really_happen_by/), but I wonder if that was a mistake.

Kevin Randle, who I consider a great researcher, had a recent [post](http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2016/07/chasing-footnotes-roswell-and-original.html) that makes you question Dolan's scholarship. 

Here are [one](http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2016/05/chasing-notes-sort-of.html) and [two](http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2015/10/chasing-more-footnotes.html) more posts in the same vein.

From time to time on this subreddit, we got one of those "Who is the best researcher" or "what are the best UFO books" questions, and invariably Dolan and his [books](https://www.amazon.com/Cover-Up-Exposed-1973-1991-National-Security-ebook/dp/B004D4Y6DG) are brought up as the gold standard.

Randle's critiques make you question the credibility of Dolan's work.

And I've watched those ["Exopolitics"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buNCOlB-HeM) videos (unfortunately) where he starts rambling about "the Rockefellers", "Breakaway civilizations", and whatnot. It seems that he has gone down the route of a conspiracy theorist.

I've tried to separate that from his written work, but I can't anymore. 

Frankly, he may be harming Ufology. 

I think there is a core of truth to Ufology (or better truths, plural). After *cutting through the bullshit*, you realize that there is some weird stuff that has happened, and is happening.  

Perhaps some of the weird stuff is in fact non-human tech: ETs, time travelers, earlier Earth civilizations, etc. 

But, there has never been any *positive* proof of this, and I don't think there ever will be. Nor do I think governments are very much "in the know" (other than having a bit more radar and video/photos of the rare credible, anomalous UFO/UAP sighting compared to the lay person).

The best we can do is dig down, cut out prosaic and human sources (balloons, hoaxes, social experiments, military tech, misidentification, etc) and label a case unexplained or anomalous.

That's good enough. That's good enough. Anything more is speculation (I love to do that as well, but let us properly label it is as speculation when we do it).

Unfortunately, I think Dolan may be [*adding*](http://www.theufochronicles.com/2015/05/roswell-slides-debacle-public-deserves.html) upon the layers of bullshit, and harming Ufology. 

I appreciate [some](http://www.openminds.tv/twelve-government-documents-that-take-ufos-seriously) of the work Dolan has done in the past, but moving forward I'll remain very skeptical.

What are your thoughts on this manner?

And to preempt those who would ask who I consider good researchers/writers (note: I don't necessarily agree with all their conclusions on UFOs, if they have any), here is a partial list:

[Kevin Randle](http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/), [Richard Hastings](http://www.ufohastings.com/), [Richard Haines](http://www.narcap.org/About_NARCAP.html), [Curt Collings](http://www.blueblurrylines.com/), [Jack Brewer](http://ufotrail.blogspot.com/), [John Greenewald](http://www.theblackvault.com/), [Paul Dean](http://ufos-documenting-the-evidence.blogspot.com/), [David Marler](http://davidmarlerufo.com/), [Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos](http://fotocat.blogspot.com/), [Mark Pilkington](https://www.amazon.com/Mirage-Men-Adventure-Espionage-Psychological/dp/1602398003), [Bruce Maccabbe](http://brumac.8k.com/) (partially, duped by Gulf Breeze/Ed Walters), [Leslie Kean](https://www.facebook.com/lesliekean/), [John Alexander](https://www.amazon.com/UFOs-Conspiracies-Realities-John-Alexander/dp/125000201X), [Keith Basterfield](http://ufos-scientificresearch.blogspot.com/).

Note: My thoughts on these researchers/writers could change in the future, as has my opinion of Dolan. </TEXT>

It could be a foreign event where you know such a thing could never happen or be legislated in the US, or a domestic legislation that fizzled out due to separation of powers.
