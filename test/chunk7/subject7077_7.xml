	<TEXT>  So they'll either need a stead stream of new characters, or they'll eventually need to do a big reboot.

I don't mean to pick one comment and focus on that, cause that was a great reply. You did make me consider a theory I have been going over for a while, which is that Holland is being "groomed" (harmlessly of course) to be the new foundation of the MCU after Infinity War.

Spider-man has traditionally been a well loved character (he's my favorite as well) and even in the comics has been called one of the greatest heroes of all time. I wouldn't be surprised if they really focused on him later on. That or Captain Marvel. 

I don't know what they'll do about Evans and RDJ, but I trust them to handle it well. 

I definitely think they have a plethora of characters to choose from and will actively, if they aren't already, try to get them back under the MCU umbrella.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't be surprised if Marvel Studios got them back in the next 5-10 years tbh. Especially if they do a deal with the FF4 parent company that is similar to the one they did with the Spider-man parent company. 

Everyone is excited for Infinity War (which I absolutely am) but I'm also super stoked to see what their new wave of films looks like. I know some people are getting sick of superhero films, but Disney has been knocking it out of the park and I'm on board if they keep up their track record.

The last few years of the MCU have been a comic lovers dream come true (at least for this comic book lover).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I reserve the right to dismiss a brand if everything I've tried of theirs has turned me off. Doesn't mean I'm not open to changing my opinion, but as it stands it's perfectly reasonable for me to not like those publishers outright.

I agree with him, right up until he begins complaining about downvotes. 

Probably shouldn't have started out by saying "fight me" though. If he had just reasonably stated his opinion from the beginning, he wouldn't have been downvoted (at least so heavily).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While you are correct that one should consider their audience, this is only an issue because the audience has chosen to react emotionally, meaning that the issue is with them, not the author. Which is exactly what I said initially.

So basically....if I want to run around saying racial slurs, it's the fault of anyone who is offended and not me? Now I get it!

I love how Dualpurposeapple somehow thinks that downvotes means he doesn't have to explain his stupid assertion.

	<TEXT> They're fucking projecting. It's weird. They're basically saying they would go to such lengths to sleep with a woman so why wouldn't the bartender.

Also, does a bartender really need to go to these lengths? I mean they have access to alcohol which they can technically give out for free. I don't really think they need to resort to complicated schemes to get laid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. Just wanna mention: As a manager of a bar, if any of you ever called the police to the bar without coming to us first, you'd most assuredly be banned from that bar.

This one was my favorite. If I feel like something is going down to such an extent that I need to call the police, it's probably too late for me to consider asking the bartender if it's okay.  </TEXT>

Nah, you got schooled already. I dont need to waste my time with your fucking TwoX post. The entire post is bullshit stories about BAR STAFF kicking out creepy dudes, not ordering an angel shot to summon police you fuckin ballbag.
I love the neck beard anti feminist rage in this thread, absolutely hilarious. The thing that gets me is that you don't realize you're as obnoxious and illogical as feminists themselves.


Who the fuck do I root for?!?! I hate when everyone in these threads sucks.

Not really an excuse for sexual harassment. 

 He more than likely isn't and is probably a sweet dude. He just has no idea how to talk to a woman and is desperate enough to lay it all out like that. When he gets shot down like that it's probably SOUL CRUSHING for that guy. Which only serves to confuse him even more.

	<TEXT> I think Ron and Jerry always had this underlying relationship where they've known each other for a long time. You're right though, I can't think of a direct episode with just them two together.

On that note you hit the nail on the head imo. What makes this show and The Office so great is that they focused heavily on relationships. They took characters with unique personalities and made them interact. Like when Terry and Ben spend a day together- absolutely out of left field with wonderful results that resonated throughout the rest of the show.

I think The Office really went downhill when they stopped doing this and started trying to be super quirky and weird with little relationship one-on-one. It got better when they started it up again in the last season (and that finale was bomb).  </TEXT>
