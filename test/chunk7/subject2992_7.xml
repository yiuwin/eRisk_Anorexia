	<TEXT> A girl I was friends with in elementary school committed suicide after the first day of school. I was starting my freshman year and she was starting her junior year. She was in choir and band and was super talented. She always seemed so happy, so it was a big shock for everyone. Our principal came in to every class on the second day of school to break the news. 

Then in my sophomore or junior year, a kid who'd been fighting brain cancer since elementary school died. I'd known him for a good 10 years. He really fought though and was a huge inspiration to so many people. His name was Kevin Cordasco. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're going to be living on campus and you want to lock up your bike outside, take your seat off. Bike seats get stolen more than the actual bikes do, at least at my school. You don't really need to do that in between classes, but really just when you're in your dorm/apartment (and especially at night).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sprained my foot last year doing an [aerial](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/80783387038667443/) silks trick and had to wear a giant walking boot for several weeks. I decided to have some fun with it and when people asked what happened, I'd say, **"I sprained my foot doing aerial... But it's okay, she was worth it."** (I told that joke in front of my parents and my mom got mad at me. My dad was proud.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't remember what scene it was, but my earliest memory is of my parents taking me to see Toy Story 2 in theaters (when I was 2) and I started crying because it scared me for some reason. Then for several years, I had a deep-seated fear of my toys coming to life. </TEXT>
