	<TEXT> Keep at it! The lack of control that comes with watercolour is one of the things that appeals to me the most, its challenging, but lots of fun. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure.

1. About 3 weeks, but I first attempted watercolour about 10 years ago. It was the first medium I ever tried and I did a handful of landscapes back then but quickly moved on to oil and acrylic.

2. A bit of both, depending on what I'm painting and what I'm trying to achieve. Working on dry paper is much more forgiving if you're looking for control.

3. No </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The items in the photo aren't extraneous. Its what I used for the painting, they are completely relevant. Also, it saves me answering questions about the materials I used for the piece. Why are you so angry mate? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really? I didn't think I was an idiot or a moron for including the paints and my brushes in the photo. Seems harsh. It helps with perspective I thought and I guess if someone else wanted to claim this as their own it would be harder to crop out the painting and repost with the other stuff in the photo. </TEXT>
