	<TITLE> Composers with Uniquely Intended Dynamic Markings </TITLE>

	<TEXT> With Beethoven, consecutive sforzandos grow in relative intensity. With Brahms, forte pianos are like sighs. 

I'm wondering if we can make a compilation of how musicians "perceive" different dynamic markings through the lenses of different composers. I think it would be helpful to determine the boundaries of stylistic freedom in context of the time period a piece is written.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the top there is a card (most likely made of chocolate by the Japanese and as is typical of Japanese cakes) that says "congratulations!" So yes, it was most likely a cake. 

Not sure the specific manga, but judging from the artwork I think it's from a popular manga where students become trapped in a haunted town where the inhabitants and items are demons.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope, they're all fan recreations! At least from what I recall people have tried to isolate the crowd, but it's mixed in with the music instead of around it, making it difficult to remove the crowd without removing the music as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you were looking to use a colon, which would allow the second half of the sentence to describe what the offer was. The comma only makes the reader awkwardly stop the flow of the sentence. 

Edit: Realized that the title in and of itself is just wrong. Hurray for reading articles.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Losing Faith in This Game </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'll keep this short and simple. 

I left League because of college life and decided to come back for the summer. Having understood the mechanics of this game from previous MOBAs and RTS', I was able to adapt to the new meta fairly well. After getting ranked again S3 (I was previously S1), I knew I could climb back to where I once was previously with enough time. And so I started playing ranked games and lo' and behold, I was able to hold my ground. I was even able to get to S1 within a week. I felt like I was on such a good roll, playing with positive people who eased any lost objectives or team fights with words of encouragement. I even got myself to my promotion to gold within two days. I was one game away. 

Then, everything went downhill. I literally felt like I was playing a totally different game. Every game, people started flaming other roles for missed ganks, lost cs, or lost towers. Individuals were pinging incessantly like a small child incessantly begs his or her parents to buy them a new toy. It was unbelievable. Needless to say, I tried to keep my cool, but I lost over 10 games in a row. As of now, I am still in S1, but I'm at a point where I just can't enjoy this game anymore.

I suppose I have written this post to see if anyone else has had the same experience as me or are willing to help in some way. I'm not saying that I deserve to be promoted, but in a game where teamwork is the key to success, having this much toxicity come out of nowhere has shocked me. 

TL;DR Wishing to find support after climbed through silver quickly with cooperative teammates, then going on a downward spiral for somehow being matched with insanely toxic players.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But I still have to disagree to the notion that this documentary would be more interesting if it interviewed more people "directly related" to Daft Punk. There's only so much that can be said about the robots themselves. It's obvious that each individual that is being interviewed brings a unique view to the world of Daft Punk, but if we don't have someone who's on the outside, who's like one of us, the story won't be complete. And what's special with Skrillex is that while he is a listener like us, he is also lauded by many to be on the forefront of the broad genre we call electronic music. He's a perfect example of someone who *isn't directly related* to Daft Punk but *is directly related* to the realm of music Daft Punk cohabits.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But how would it be informative to just interview individuals who simply worked with Daft Punk? I like the idea of Skrillex being in there not for what he has done for mainstream music, but to be able to hear how such a world renowned musician was affected and inspired to create his work by only hearing Daft Punk perform.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lots of great examples and details on what defines "interpretation" here. If I can add an analogy, imagine two people reciting the Gettysburg Address: a child and an adult. If we assume that the child has the average intellect, enunciation, etc. of a child, we could probably hear a child reciting Lincoln's words very absentmindedly, taking no pauses, and the like. Now when we imagine an adult of average intellect, enunciation, etc. to recite the Gettysburg Address, we may imagine him taking pauses, lowering and raising his voice on certain passages and words, and the like. We can assume this is true because with historical knowledge, an understanding of proper phrasing, and maturity in conveying a message, the adult will have a much different "interpretation" of the speech than the child's interpretation.

In the world of music, the speeches we give have less context and physical meaning than a speech composed of words, based solely on the fact that a note does not have a specific connotation, and will change connotation based on whichever piece the note is being used in. This means that a person's characteristics and experiences will tremendously affect how a piece is played and give them a unique "interpretation."   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, first composer that comes to mind for "must play" violin repertoire is Bach. When it comes to accompanied violin pieces though, difficulty is the main factor in guiding what to play than a general guideline for violin repertoire. As mentioned above, Beethoven violin sonatas are difficult. Very difficult; in that they require great bow control and melodic understanding. On the other hand Mozart violin sonatas are more lenient for the violinist since Mozart features the piano more than the violin. Kreisler's Praeludium and Allegro is a popular show piece though!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bach writes his G minor Violin Sonata in the key of D minor. I looked up the wiki article on his violin sonatas, and it states that it was convention for Baroque composers to write pieces that are in G minor as if they are in D minor. Why is that so?  </TEXT>
