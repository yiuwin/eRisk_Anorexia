	<TEXT> I've (somewhat) been waiting to post this. 

My fourth-grade teacher made a kid with a broken arm handwrite a long assignment like the rest of us. Typically she'd allow him to use one of the computers in the classroom until his arm healed up (he was right-handed; his right arm was broken).

She gave him the command after she'd finished yelling at us and slamming a textbook down. "No! You'll write it like the rest of them."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Episode five specifically, and afterwards when David: 

[Spoiler](/s Begins realizing his powers and becomes more of a mad god.) 

Got a huge Rand vibe from a few of the David scenes later on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again: If she knew you were being compassionate out of pity, she would give you the same response. 

Keep flailing around because someone is challenging your shallow worldview. I know that you want to believe you're thinking about this deeply  possibly because you aren't capable of anything otherwise, I don't know  but you're not.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And why would I explain this to her?

Physically unattractive and mentally unattractive = I will still be nice because she has a real uphill climb in life. 

So you're being fake nice. Real stand-up guy. Gotcha. 

Are you socially inept? 

Look in the mirror and ask yourself that if you think this is truly the thought process of a grown man. No one needs your pity over the flaws you perceive in them.  </TEXT>
