* reddit will still allow CSS customization on top of the new interface, but will be less hesitant about breaking subreddit styles

* "Logos, images, colors, spoilers, menus, flairs (all kinds), and lots more will be supported"

* "Widgets" mentioned in previous post aren't directly related (they're more related to stuff like calendars/scoreboards in sidebars, e.g. in sports subreddits); they're still considering how to go about accepting user-created widgets, and widgets will be updateable using the API

* the change/redesign will happen slowly/gradually

* they'll start with a small alpha testing group and gradually expand to an opt-in beta </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Naturally, she covered the Comey thing, though I think we have yet to see the real repercussions of that. The segment on Ivanka's book was pretty funny too; she really architected the shit out of that :P

The best part of the episode, though, was the segment on restoring voting rights to ex-felons. It seems insane that a single mistake can forever keep you from being a full member of society, even after you've served your sentence. It also seems insane that Republicans feel justified in taking a civil right away from a class of people simply because they think enfranchising them would help the other side. Also: fuck Scott Walker. (I also noticed that Florida AG Pam Bondi was on that board; you might recognize her as the one who dropped plans to join a lawsuit against Trump University after Trump used his foundation to donate to her reelection campaign.)

[Here's the link to the Miami Rights site](https://www.miamirights.com/), which includes not only a link to the petition and to a donation form for the Floridians for a Fair Democracy organization, but also the full "Miami Rights" theme song. According to it, there are two other states where felons are banned from voting for life; [this site](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx) gives more details (Iowa and Virginia are the other two). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the Know Your Meme page about it: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/electric-boogaloo

 Electric Boogaloo is a phrase typically appended to the title of a sequel TV or film production to mock its poor quality. Originally featured in the title of the poorly received 1984 dance film Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo, the term refers to a type of dance move that arose out of funk and hip hop styles in the 1970s, popularized by the street dance team The Electric Boogaloos.

 Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo  was released on December 21st, 1984 and was met with mediocre reviews from Variety who called it a comic book and Roger Ebert who gave it 3 stars. As of March 2013, the film has been given 4.3 stars out of 10 on IMDb and 3.4 starts out of 5 on Rotten Tomatoes. Online, the phrase became adopted as a denotation of any sequel release as early as October 2nd, 2001, in a blog post about a radio show by actor Wil Wheaton.

 In the early 2000s, the phrase was used offline in titles of works by Christian ska band Five Iron Frenzy and indie rock band Minus the Bear. In July 2005, the first YTMND site using this title format was created by user Pandaman87, as it was a sequel to one of his previous sites. As of March 2013, there are nearly 20 other sites that use Electric Boogaloo in their titles.

 In November 2005, Electric Boogaloo was first used in this manner by a journalist on the Huffington Post, regarding election reform in Ohio. In July 2007, the New York Times used the term in reference to the sequel to the viral video Ive Got a Crush on Obama, marking one of the first times it was used in a negative fashion. In August of that year, a blog post on the Oxford University Press examined the titling structure and defined it as a snowclone that is used to denote any sequel production, which later became supported through its documentation on the Snowclone Database in 2008. On May 25th, 2008, Electric Boogaloo was similarly defined as a general description for sequels on Urban Dictionary. </TEXT>

If possible, please edit the survey to add an "other" gender option; otherwise, feel free to resubmit with the proper title, though you should note that it's a repost to avoid duplicate responses.

(Also, several of your questions have answer options that aren't clearly distinct from one another. For example: In question 3, what's the difference between "Whoever I fall in love with" and "I don't think about race in retaionships" (should be "relationships")? And for 6, what's the difference between "Sometimes" and "Only when I'm joking"? The "sometimes" option doesn't say "sometimes, in a serious manner".) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyway, pretty disappointing episode (with one or two exceptions). The NATO subplot was poorly executed, and nothing of note really happened; I guess it's good to see Kirkman occasionally lose, but his attempt to sway countries to his side of things was thoroughly uninspiring. At least Moss let him know to expect the failure. Speaking of whom, Kirkman's interactions with Moss were also pretty lame. At least Seth brought some humor to the episode.

The tech side of things was also lame. Chuck's always great, but Whitaker magically getting away was just dumb. Normally, they could just check the security footage to look where he was and then identify him, but I doubt this show will be that smart about it.

Hannah's side of things was equally incoherent. She just stumbles around the ship, sends out a nigh-useless distress call (she just repeats her name a bunch) and then runs off without taking either the axe from before or the guns of the men she dropped a bookshelf on, and gets caught by Lozano who taunts her over Jason's death. Then Lozano shoves her in a van with a bunch of bombs, and apparently it's in the parking garage of the FBI headquarters, the J. Edgar Hoover Building. (By the way, it seemed really obvious from the way it was filmed/shown to the viewer that she'd end up not being in that welded-shut shipping container - it's a common trope in TV shows and movies.) Seems like a weird choice on Lozano's part... I guess we'll see how that plays out. Obviously Hannah will be fine.

The highlight of the episode for me personally was seeing an Indian as the UK prime minister. Yay representation! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm glad the show finally had Peyton address just how messed up the relationship was... JK. She got upset that Blaine hadn't told her only because Liv (and Major) could have taken the cure ages ago. Nothing about all the people (including homeless kids) he murdered... (Sidenote: she was still unnecessarily hostile - again - to Ravi when telling her about what Don E said. She barely apologized by the end once she realized he was right.)

Looks like Peyton noticed the oddly rushed resolution to last week's case, too. I guess someone big is the true culprit, and they're just using the guy who confessed as a fall guy. We'll probably see more about it in the coming weeks.

The introduction of Major's mom and girlfriend seemed rushed and wasn't really addressed later... Perhaps we'll see them again? Not sure of their relevance to the plot, though.

And, of course, someone has stolen the remaining syringes of the cure (maybe Blaine, or Don E? or even Fillmore Graves?), and Blaine is making more of the memory serum. (...Speaking of which, Blaine returned with the printout the minute Liv left, but Peyton didn't bother going after Liv to give it to her? This is not a great friendship.)

I'm glad the worst love triangle in the show's history is finally over. (I hope.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Maybe you could collaborate with /u/patwhit01 and /u/jesusmonroe so that there's only one of these threads per day, alternating between characters/cases/mechanics. These improvement threads are great but having too many at once might make things too confusing.

Yes please. The character/case/mechanic discussions can be good, but if we get a bunch of them in a short period of time, the quality of the comments tends to get worse, and others just jump on the bandwagon to shitpost.

(I figured I'd leave in the username mentions in my quote so they see my comment here as well.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...Hmm. I just tested the exact search you did, and looking for `youtube` does indeed return no results - in fact, there isn't even the message `there doesn't appear to be anything here` that normally appears when a search has no results. It's possible that the search is returning too many results and reddit can't handle it. Searching for `reddit` has the same effect.

You should post this to /r/bugs. </TEXT>
