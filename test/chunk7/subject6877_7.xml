YouTube went and made it unavailable for devices because they haven't figured out how to advertise on mobile phones yet so I apologise for that but I left a link to watch on other platforms if you can't see! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have five minutes spare so I will give it a quick go.   

*I will only do England and Internationals and guys feel free to correct me.*  

The Premership is the top domestic league in England where you have the top teams in our country playing. Below that you have the championship and below that National One and so on. The teams in National One are working to get promoted into the premiership and one team will get promoted in the premiership every year if they win the league. Similarly the bottom team of the premiership will get relegated down a league.  

International Matches are set up by the IRB (International Rugby Board) I believe and they set up the dates for how many games a nation will pick. You will have the Six Nations from February-March. Then the Summer Tours in June, and the autumn internationals in November. When the World Cup is on they don't have the autumn internationals.  

Hope this helps a bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not me attempting to belittle Scotland. I believe they have 4 or five players who could very well make it into the squad and also the starting line up. However in this case there are factors that mean other players get the nod.  

Coaches picking certain Scottish players just because they want to include Scottish players is pointless and if anything insulting to Scotland. I'd much rather pick them purely on their quality than getting politics into it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 100% totally agree on the Henshaw thing. Great argument to have him in the starting team.  

Different viewpoint on Peter O'Mahony. Granted he played his absolute heart out on Saturday and deserved the plaudits he gets. However the idea that we need players to rally or get other players up for it simply can't cut it these days. In my opinion a player should never be picked due to their leadership skills unless they are an captain who is indispensable. You need the players who are technically the best they can be and they should have the mental strength to perform without the leadership of others. This is mainly why I would take Alun Wyn Jones on tour as captain of the midweek team. Leaders are needed before and after matches, not during them. In my opinion anyway.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My "Controversial" View on the Possible Lions Squad/Team </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-21 18:04:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is going to be a long read, and a lot of what I say is not backed up so take this with a grain of salt.  

I'll start by looking back at the *Guardian's* 2005 post tour article about what they believed the Lions needed to do in 12 years time to combat [New Zealand](http://i.imgur.com/3ydOJRo.png).  

Nationality has always been a massive [talking point](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jun/24/lions2005.rugbyunion1) as we can see here when Clive Woodward was accused of picking a mainly English starting lineup in the loss to New Zealand. More and more I have seen the main content of Lion's team threads in here focused on what nationalities the players are. This should not even be a talking point.  

I have always believed the reason why the Southern Hemisphere teams have dominated in previous tours in because they have a smaller squad and they know from an early stage what their starting line up is going to be. I believe for the last tour there was 36 in the squad itself. This amount of players means that selectors become blinded on who the strongest team really is due to the fact that there are just so many players there. I understand this amount is needed to combat midweek games but Gatland should then announce a starting squad of 20 players and a secondary squad of 16 players as a midweek team.  

The main focus should be on the team that we can all generally agree is a team of the best players that our four nations can have. Things that should not come into question are things such as, "Wales and Scotland haven't beaten NZ in ages." This is an absurd comment to make when you consider the fact that if we picked a starting lineup purely of English and Irish players, each player would only have ever beaten New Zealand once.  

I understand form is a huge factor for selection in April but this should not really be a huge factor for Gatland in my opinion. By the time he has selected these players and they are on the plane to New Zealand they could have lost all that form and therefore he should not rely too heavily on this.  

I'll throw my hand into the fire and select the team that I genuinely believe can beat New Zealand and I'll say why I think each player deserves at this point to be in that starting line up.  

1. Mako Vunipola (He has not played a great deal for England in 2017 however he is a proven carrier and will cause New Zealand no end of problems. 

2. Ken Owens (This pick would appear to go against my idea of not picking players on form alone. However Owens has been a rock for Wales all tournament and he has not been out shined in a single game for the last 16 months (arguably). Dane Coles will offer a very different challenge as he is faster and possibly more dynamic than Ken but hookers rarely end up tackling each other.  

3. Tadh Furlong (An absolute monster of a carrier and scrummager for Ireland ever since the Autumn internationals. In 2005 there was a really strong focus on players being strong in the set piece. The starting three of Julian White, Gethin Jenkins and Shane Byrne were exposed for their lack of carrying skills and I believe with this starting three you will get a great amount of firepower as well as set piece prowess.  

4. Joe Launchbury (Pretty clear cut choice for me here and stats back it up. Whoever Gatland picks here is going to be vital against Retallick/Whitelock.   

5. Maro Itoje (In the lineout, you know what you are going to get from him, consistency. The main consideration in picking him here is due to the fact that he basically acts as a fourth Back Row in terms of the breakdown and this is going to be pivotal against a New Zealand team that capitalises so much on turnover counter attacks.  

6. CJ Stander (When you take into consideration who New Zealand might start at 6 in that first test Kaino is the first that comes to mind. Stander is a player who I believe can combat him in this position. The questions is would Warburton be able to carry as well against Read, Kaino and Cane. Would Robshaw/Haskell have the pace needed to deal with a player like Savea?  [Stander can do both.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWNfDYSBMB8)  

7. Justin Tipuric (His speed and workrate helps to balance the power and carrying of Vunipola and Stander. Would do well against someone like Savea. 

8. Billy Vunipola (Proven effectiveness against Australia last year. The stats with his carrying and additionally his offloads show he won't turn into a one dimensional player when under severe pressure. Having said that I believe Moriarty should be included as a close second due to his sheer physicality.   

9. Conor Murray (Deserves to be starting in this spot without a doubt. Consistent performances for the last 16-18 months and his game management will be key.  

10. Jonny Sexton (Another no brainer in terms of quality and consistency. His attacking strength combined with his defence will be so important against players such as Barrett.  

11. Elliot Daly (With Daly you get a player who has speed but someone who works extremely hard to get back to defend [breaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YRAh1RGso). His defensive work and speed make him my 11 for the first test.   

12. Owen Farrell (His defence will be key against NZ's strong carriers but he has answered critics of him against his [attacking ability](https://youtu.be/sYAbIoe_bw8?t=34s) this year and I feel he will do well with the likes of Sexton. His placekicking will be vital as well if he is chosen to take them.  

13. Jonathan Joseph (The amount of tries he has accumulated means he must be considered as the starting thirteen for the Lions. You can't base this pick purely on his performance against Scotland who even they will admit were weak that day. Instead the tries he scored against Australia in the Summer and in the Autumn I believe highlight his real strength and that is his execution on the counter attack.[This example](https://youtu.be/cg8jmqWicO0?t=9m53s) and [this example](https://youtu.be/WKhOtOMJ9dY?t=6m36s) illustrate how JJ can punish teams when they make mistakes. NZ will not many mistakes but if they do, having a player like JJ in the team will make the likelihood of points coming out a real possibility.  

14. George North (In [2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L46Uzudj4Ds) North came up against the threat of Israel Folau and he dealt with it superbly. This time around he could come up against either Savea or Naholo and North's power will be key in dealing with this. Daly's speed combined with North's power means they can challenge the threat posed by speedsters such as Ben Smith.   

15. Stuart Hogg (My first name in the starting line up. [Hogg's ability](https://youtu.be/iBv69DihgiY?t=3m13s) to create an a chance from nothing portrays to me just how effective he will be in the Summer. He has had his critics about his defence but I feel that his danger in attack make him a certain pick.   

TL;DR: Gatland must not focus on form and nationality. Pick his squad with starting line up already chosen in mind.  </TEXT>

You do realise how this just makes you seem like a petty person? 

We live and learn but maybe think before you post immature brat like things. 

Enjoy my downvote. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have and I think you'll find the atmosphere in these cities is very different to the Six Nations. In the Six Nations, a lot of people will still travel to placea like Paris and Rome and watch the game in the city on TV somewhere if they were not able to get tickets. Likewise the other way around. This is because they are able to afford the relatively close distance. This in turn creates great atmosphere in many cities you on match day. However if Georgia entered Io think you would only find the die hard fans making the effort to travel over and you wouldn't get such an amazing atmosphere  sorry typing on my phone. </TEXT>
