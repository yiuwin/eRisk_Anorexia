	<TEXT> I basically have a breakdown if I don't run or bike for a day. It's not mentally healthy, but it relieves an immense amount of anxiety and alleviates my mood a ton. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of mine are super cheap sports-like bras. I'd like to get better ones but I'm gonna be a college kid, so that's not happening...

I really like the feel of sports bras though. I have small-ish boobs so it works out fine </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was terrified as a six/seven-year-old learning to bike. I fell once and started crying at the suggestion I kept trying.

Now I adore cycling, and will bike 30 miles around cities and forests alike! It's really the fear of failure that almost stopped me. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone, new poster. So...I'm a 17 year-old girl who was diagnosed professionally with Aspergers Syndrome.  I have always been very rigid in my schedules, bad coordination, depression and anxiety, and few friends. As a kid, I had very focused interests; now I have compulsive behaviors and thoughts, though I do not have OCD. Despite all these symptoms and an official diagnosis, I feel like a can't relate to any other aspies.

(Note: Please do not be offended, these are simply the binding interests of many aspies I know)
For example, I don't have an interest in anime, most cartoons, video games, transportation, or technology. Rather, my interests are sociology, political science, abnormal psychology, long-distance running, cycling, and makeup (a form of art i suppose). I'm sure I'm not alone, but I feel like I am. The group at my school is full of people I'm frankly intimidated by; they are loud, obsessed with MLP, and generally unpleasant to be around. Regular people don't want to be with me because I'm too neurotic...

Sorry for the unstructured rant, I'm not in a great mood right now.

	<TEXT> Personally, Conditions of my Parole is my favorite, but Money Shot is fairly close. I just think Conditions is AMAZING, while I don't really care for Galileo or Grand Canyon on the new album. The EPs have good songs too, but I tend not to like the remixes, For me, V is for Vagina only has about 5 songs I'd listen to...the rest kind of drone on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally didn't see any overt Tool fans, except for maybe a shirt...nothing yelled out like "PLAY SOBER!" However, I was right behind the dude who lit up s joint; they were hollering and dancing and staring everyone down for "not getting into it." They were kicked out after the alarm; second half went by much smoother, obviously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to listen to the Lateralus album on the bus. I don't know if that's "impure," but i closed my eyes and just completely tuned out the background chatter. I didn't do any wack transcending planes of consciousness, but I was able to enjoy the music on a deeper level than usual. You can do it anywhere if you're focused enough. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> First Tool Song? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Not a complex question, but I'm wondering if anyone else has a memorable experience of how they first discovered Tool.



I was a probably in 9th grade who was dragged to my parent's friend's silent auction. I got so bored that I hopped in the parked car and flipped through radio stations. I guess I stumbled upon an alternative rock station right as Parabola started playing. It was entrancing...I couldn't define exactly what made the music so special, but I just lay back and tried to soak all the words in.  This sounds stupid, but at the time I feel like it was one of those "aha" moments. When I got home, I googled all the lyrics I remembered to find the song. Best decision I ever made. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition, do they really expect people who own the CDs to never skip songs? There's still track listings, and I think it's a bit controlling to try and determine how customers view your art to such an extent. Listening to songs flow into another is very cool. but sometimes people really want to listen to a certain song. I don't think that makes them any less of a fan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know I may get hate for this, but I really wish they'd do digital release on their music. I think the whole "musical integrity" argument is kind of silly...I would still listen to the albums in order if I had them on my iPhone, and it seems they're fine with Pandora shuffling their music. </TEXT>
