	<TEXT> Lol, they already have a narrative.  

There is a video on that article stating "who inherited the better economy".  They used Bush for years to explain why Obama's economy sucks.  They'll use Obama for years to explain away why Trump's economy rocks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A teacher starts class and says, "We are going over spelling and geography today.  Susie, Billy, and Johnny please come up to the front and spell out three countries from the continents I tell you.

All three kids walk up and grab a piece of chalk. 

"Susie, your continent is South America."
She looks at Susie's answers and sees:

* Brazil
* Chile
* Peru

"Great job Susie!  You spelled them all correctly." the teacher smiles at Susie.

"Billy, your continent is Europe."
She looks at Billy's answers and sees:

* Italy
* France
* Switzerland

"Wow Billy, great job.  Very proud of you!", the teacher pats Billy on the head.

"Johnny, your continent is Africa."
She looks at Johnny's answers and sees:

* Ghana p
* Kenya p
* Nigeria p

The teacher is confused and asks, "Well you spelled them right, but what's with the p?"

Johnny replies, "All countries are in continent." </TEXT>

I'm Mexican and she has been trying to be scare me about supporting Trump.  She's white, yet feels like she has the duty to tell me how I should as a minority.

	<TEXT> I was running through a narrow trail when I spotted three teenage boys walking in front of me.  I shouted, "Coming behind you" hoping they'd move out of the way.  Two of them did, but the third guy had headphones.  So as I'm approaching them and about the pass he suddenly realizes his friends aren't with him and turns around right as I'm about to reach him.  He let out loudest high pitched scream and started waving his arms.  I smiled apolegetically and heard his friends laughing loudly as I kept running by them. </TEXT>
