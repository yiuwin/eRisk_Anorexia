	<TEXT> I think that it had a fantastic first half and a fantastic second half...but each was attached to the wrong movie.

It went from fun comedy to a darker superhero drama after the midpoint.

If it had stuck with one or the other, it would have been far better than it was.

So, like I said, it was two halves of a good movie, just attached to the wrong other half. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just going to keep this short.

I absolutely loved Starlight Glimmer as the villain in *Cutie Re-Mark*. She was absolutely fantastic.

One big reason why I loved her as a villain is that, because of her time-travel capabilities, she was executing a near-[Xanatos Gambit](https://www.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit).

Also, because of her time-travel capabilities, it forced Twilight to create a so-called "third option" whose success relied simply on a roll of the dice. If she succeeded, the episode plays out as it did. If she failed, though, Equestria becomes a shithole as it had kept playing out in the altered timelines. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Springfield is gigantic.

I like to try and align my Springfield to a grid as I can, as well as "theme" different parts of the city, like all the residences are on Evergreen Terrace, City Hall, the DMV, Springfield Police Station, etc. are all near each other, etc.

Having such a large Springfield makes it hard to place things, especially when scrolling through the horizontal lists.

I'd love it if they added an overhead "city manager" view, so you can see all of your Springfield at once.

I think it'd make life a lot easier when renegotiating your city. </TEXT>

In TMP, Ki-Adi-Mundi said "the Sith have been extinct for a millenia [sic]" and in AOTC, Palpatine said that the Republic was 1,000 years old.

I took some creative liberties, utilizing humanity's love of rounding off numbers, so that the DONO was on RY1138:5:25, and used that as my base time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes.

This is all based on the Coruscant Standard Year.

Like how we have UTC/GMT/Zulu as a common point of reference, so too would the galaxy. Especially the galaxy.

If you're on Alderaan and someone tells you that you have a conference call Monday at noon with people from Naboo and Malastare, whose Monday do you use? Whose noon?

This is where the Galactic Standard Calendar comes in.

(I'll throw in a note up top.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pablo Hidalgo has mentioned several times on his Twitter that there is no new dating system to replace the Legends-ized BBY/ABY (which he has expressed disdain for), so, a few weeks ago, I developed a new system. I'd like your honest opinions.

(Pardon the formatting. It's a lot cleaner and easier to read in Excel)

Note that this is intended to be equivalent to our UTC/GMT/Zulu, a common point of reference for people working from different time zones, or, in this case, on different planets that all have their own day lengths and year lengths. In this case, it uses Coruscant's day and year length as the common point of reference, so that if there is an interplanetary conference call between Coruscant, Naboo, Malastare and Alderaan at "noon tomorrow", they can all log in at the same time, that is, at 1200 hours in Coruscant's main time zone, probably that of the Senate.

I used the XX:XX:XX date writing system from the Legends calendar, as well as working to maintain the canon seven-day week and Earth day names 

So, the base system is:

* 60 seconds = 1 minute

* 60 min = 1 hour

* 25 hrs = 1 day

* 7 days = 1 week

* 5 wks = 1 month/35d = 1 mo

* 10 mo = 1 year/350d = 1 yr

The days of the week are:

* Sunday ("Day of the Son")

* Monday ("Day of Mortis")

* Tuesday ("Day of the Daughter")

* Wednesday ("Day of the One")

* Thursday ("Day of the Force")

* Friday ("Day of the Father")

* Saturday ("Day of the Sabre")

Notice a theme?

I took the idea of how most of the English names for the days of the week are named for Norse mythology (Wednesday = Woden [Odin]'s day) and incorporated ancient galactic mythology, that of Mortis, into the days of the week.

Now, I did have to play with things a little to get it to work, which is where I improvised and created some ancient Basic words (think Greek's influence on English):

* Sns--Snsd (pronounced "sun", but almost grunting with during the "u")

* Mort--Mortd (Mort is the ancient name for Mortis)

* Tus--Tusd (Tus being the Ancient word for "daughter")

* Uon--Uond (Uon is pronounced "wahn", meaning "one")

* Furs--Fursd (Furs is the ancient term for the Force)

* Frii--Friid (Frii meaning father)

* Sabr--Sabrd (Sabr, meaning sabre, referring to the Dagger of Mortis)

Got it so far? Okay.

Now, then, the months:

* Month 1 - Corusca

* Month 2 - Corell

* Month 3 - Aldera

* Month 4 - Chandril

* Month 5 - Kashik

* Month 6 - Kwat (from "Kuat")

* Month 7 - Nalha

* Month 8 - Both (pronounced "Bawth", like Bothan)

* Month 9 - Mandal

* Month 10 - Morab

The years are calculated from the founding of the Galactic Republic a millennium prior to TMP (or, in this case, 1125 years, taking advantage of the human predilection for rounding off larger numbers, as well as approximating). The Empire maintained the same calendar, though re-dated with the new year to be Empire Day. 

So, TMP is in Republic Year (RY)1125. So, for example, Obi-Wan, who was 25 in TMP, was born in RY1100.

Then, following the establishment of the Empire, the calendar reset, so the Battle of Yavin was in EY19 and TMP was in BE13 (Before the Empire).

Per my calendar, the Battle of Naboo was on RY1125:4:14, or Chandril 14, Republic Year 1125.

And the Declaration of a New Order? RY1138:5:25 (Yes. That was intentional, and the base date for the whole calendar), which is also EY00:1:1.

I also figure that the Rebels would continue to use and date by the Republic calendar, as a manner of protest. (And that the First Order would continue to use the Imperial Calendar)

The dates are as follows: 

* BE13:9:25/RY1125:4:14 - Battle of Naboo

* BE3:10:27/RY1135:5:16 - Battle of Geonosis

* EY00:1:1/RY1138:5:25 - Declaration of a New Order

* EY19:1:15/RY1157:6:4 - Battle of Yavin

* EY22:5:25/RY1160:10:14 - Battle of Hoth

* EY23:1:1/RY1161:5:25 - Battle of Endor

* EY24:1:5/RY1162:5:29 - Battle of Jakku

* EY54:5:21/RY1192:10:10 - Battle of Starkiller Base

I've also dated when major characters were born, and the conversion table between calendars.

Anyhoo, that's what I'll give you for now.

	<TEXT> No. We have yet to even begin choosing who the final candidates are.

Each state's branch of the two major parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, get to choose how the candidates are nominated, either with a caucus, where groups of voters gather (at people's houses, in school gymnasiums, etc.) and decide who to support, or through primaries, which are standard pick-a-person elections.

February 1 begins the Primaries, as they are called, with the Iowa caucuses, followed by the New Hampshire primary elections on February 9.

Caucuses are typically restricted to party members, but primary elections typically come in three forms: open, semi-closed and closed. 
* Open primaries are where a registered voter can vote for any party. An Libertarian could vote for who they want as the Republican candidate, and vice versa.
* Closed are where you can *only* vote for members of your party and if you are not a registered member of a party, you can't vote for a candidate.
* Semi-closed are where non-partisan voters can vote, but they have to choose which party they are voting for.

Iowa and New Hampshire have the first primaries in the country. Though neither are "major" states (like California, New York, Texas, Illinois, and Florida) nor populous states, they act as a sort of thermometer, for lack of a better term, for the candidates campaigns. Lower-polling candidates may, and often do, begin to drop out here.

Then South Carolina has their primary.

Following that, this year on March 1, is what is called "Super Tuesday", where the largest share of states vote on the same day (about half the states this year). This is typically the make-or-break day for a candidate's campaign. Most lower-polling candidates will have stopped their campaigns by this time, or else following super Tuesday.

Because the parties at the state-level divisions determine when the primaries are, they can continue for months. This year, they continue through June.

(Sidenote: US political party control is more focused on the state-level divisions than the national-level committees, though the National Committees of both parties set the official party agenda.)

Then, once the primaries are over, the states send their delegates to the Democratic/Republican National Conventions, held every four years.

Even though the candidate is relatively clear by the end of the primaries, and often by Super Tuesday, the conventions are where the presidential candidates are formally selected, as well as the vice  presidential candidates.

(Sidenote: Often, in the weeks leading up to the conventions, the nominee-presumptive will have already selected their running mate. Even though formality states that the VP is nominated by the conventions, conventionally, whomever the nominee-presumptive picks as their running mate is who the convention votes for.)

Following the conventions, the Democratic and Republican candidates for president (and, by exe tlattension, vice president) begin their full run for president over the following months, until the first Tuesday in November when the general elections are held, which is when the president and vice president are "selected" (with the loser regularly giving a concession speech and calling the winner to congratulate them) and the entire lower house of the legislature and 1/3 of the upper house of the legislature.

(Sidenote: The president and vice president aren't officially elected until the Electoral College meets and officially elects the president and vice president, but that is a whole other can of worms.) </TEXT>

Instead of a six and a half foot hole, it's a heavily armored structure that had to be damaged internally to be destroyed.

So, they did learn.

Same reason the *Finalizer*'s main bridge was more flush with the hull, as well as why it had a secondary bridge. They didn't want to make the same mistakes as they add with the *Executor*-class SSDs.

And probably why even the main-line TIEs (the TIE/fo's) had shields and the pilots were treated as soldiers, not expendable troops. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [SPOILERS] How Starkiller Base's weapon worked and why it could be seen from Takodana </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-12 09:18:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *Warning: text wall ahead*

I figured I'd post this in case someone hasn't seen it. 

It explains how the weapon works, why it streaked across the galaxy in red beams, and why the streaks and the destruction of the Hosnian system could be seen from Takodana.

Pulled from the novelization via Wookieepedia (article: "Starkiller Base"):

The weapon ran on a type of dark energy called "quintessence", which was ubiquitous in the universe, and offered a practically unlimited power source to the First Order. Using a star as a power source, an array of collectors on one side of the planet would gather dark energy in stages, redirecting it to the planetary core, where it was held in place by the natural magnetic field of the planet, as well as an artificial containment field maintained by the machinery the First Order had installed within the crust. As the planetary magnetic field would not be enough to contain the amount of energy that the weapon required, a thermal oscillator was built into the planet. It generated an oscillating containment field which allowed the installation to expend considerably less energy at containing the dark energy than would be required using a steady containment field. A colossal hollow cylinder, large enough to dominate the view of the planet from orbit, penetrated the containment field to a predetermined distance, in order to direct the blast towards its target, and also to absorb its energy, which would otherwise cause catastrophic groundquakes. This design made the weapon vulnerable when it was fully charged, as the destruction of the containment field oscillator the moment before the weapon fired would release the accumulated energy not through the firing cylinder, but throughout the planetary core where it was being held, leading to the gradual collapse of the surface into the core.

...In order for the weapon to fire, its weapons engineers would induce a breach in the containment field, allowing the collected dark energy to escape the core through the hollow cylinder opening on the antipodes of the planet relative to the stellar collector. During this process, the dark energy transformed to a state known as "phantom energy", and left the planet behind, tearing a hole through hyperspace along a perfectly linear path. The people stationed at the Base called the dimension through which the phantom energy beam traveled "sub-hyperspace", and this method of delivering the payload was near-instantaneous across vast distances. The rotation and inclination of the planet had to be taken into account for the weapon to target something, and also the lack of obstacles between it and the target, as the phantom energy beam would only be intercepted by an object of sufficient mass (like a planet). When the phantom energy struck a planet, the interaction produced enough heat to ignite the planet's core, creating a pocket nova. The space-time disruption caused by the phantom energy's passage would make the nova instantaneously visible thousands of light years away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a couple years old, max. Think along the lines of Just Cause and Far Cry

One of, if not the, first game trailer showed the PC getting off a bus in the mountains, and meeting with the villain of the game (IIRC) right as they get off the bus, but this would be before the PC knows he's the villain. I want to say the villain had white hair, and I want to put it in the pointy Cloud Strife-style, but I could be mis-remembering.

I want to say it was the fifth entry in the franchise, being "Game Title V" (versus Game Title: Subtitle).

Any ideas? </TEXT>

Not something you want in a high-powered Force user.

Even Vader, who was very troubled emotionally up until the last moments of his life, never threw rage-tantrums.

Part of the problem is probably that Ben missed out on parenting by two wonderful people because he was sent to be trained, as one amongst one hundred, by his uncle, so he might have some emotional damage, a feeling of "why didn't they want me?"/"why don't they love me?" </TEXT>

In Ep IV, Chewie shoots a stormtrooper and he just flops over like every other dead stormtrooper.

This one packs a fucking punch. 

It's also been 30 years, so his old bowcaster may have worn out/been lost/been destroyed. Modern guns are explosively-propelled mechanical weapons. Star Wars, mostly, uses energy weapons, which probably puts more wear-and-tear on the guns than bullets do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Immediately, I can figure that Nines (FN-2199, fka TR-8R) is going to be the new Boba Fett, especially considering the fandom that's cropped up around him in under a month. At SDCC 2016, there are going to be plenty of FN-2199s, I'm sure of it.

But I think that Temmin "Snap" Wexley (Greg Grunberg's character, and a name some of you might recognize from *Aftermath*), is going to be the Wedge of the ST, that is, the older, more experienced pilot that is a secondary character who plays the Gunther to the core team, but ultimately survives all three and plays an important role in all three movies (IV- wingman to Luke, V- wingman to Luke, VI- Red Leader and wingman to Lando, and celebrated with them, got a two-hand handshake from Chewie and a handshake and a bro-hug from Luke and garnered his own rather large fandom in and of itself. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A thought on Halo 4 and Halo 5 (SPOILERS) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-28 08:18:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know they are considered to be people's least-favorite Halos so far, so I figured I'd say my piece about them.

Part of the reason, I think, why 4 and 5 are considered "weaker" entries, is because they are suffering from middle-movie syndrome, that is, middle entries tend to be heavy on the [rising action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#Rising_action) because they are setting up Part III (and IV, V, VI...). Halo 2 suffered from this, since it had follow up on the Chief's story, as well as turning the Covenant and Flood from Evil Space Aliens Who I'm Supposed to Kill and Alien Zombie Creatures Who I'm Supposed to Kill into a complex political alliance that is based on a lie, and expanding the AZCWISTKs into being far more intelligent and clever than they seem at first glance and introducing the leaders of both sides, as well as raising the stakes for Part III (introducing the Ark, as well as Truth taking the Keyship).

Because Halo 3 ended with the (more-or-less) conclusion of the War, and left the Chief adrift in space heading for the Legendary Planet, i.e. Requiem, so Halo 4 had to show the fate of the Chief, the aftermath of the War, as well as introduce us to the new overarching and recurring villains of the new games, the Prometheans. So, Halo 4 had to be both a concluding chapter and an opening chapter.

Halo 4 was Interim, Part 1 of 2.

Halo 5 is Interim, Part 2 of 2.

Since Halo 4 tied off the dangling thread from H3 (the Chief being MIA on the *POA*), Halo 5 has the job of setting up the new story arc, which sets up the games to come. It introduces Cortana and the Created as a villain, the Guardians and their role, as well as the *Infinity* being on the run from Cortana, and Halsey, Blue Team and FT Osiris, the Arbiter, et al. undoubtedly starting to plan on how to stop Cortana at the end of H5.

Halo 6 will likely be a "full-fledged" Halo entry, since the new storyline has been introduced and started, the villainess and her henchmen are in play, the heroes, both new and old, have formed into a united front against the villains (who know all their tricks and tactics, potentially creating a massive problem for the heroes), as well as placing the secondary heroes (Lasky, Palmer, et al.) on the run from the villain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All the reviews I've read give it between a 7-8 on average and say that it is amazingly gorgeous and sounds fantastic (but that they could have gotten better voice actors), but that the gameplay gets stale after 10 hours and that it is more oriented towards casual Star Wars fans, versus us harder-core Battlefront vets.

So, is Battlefront worth the $60? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-11-18 07:27:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The five games of the AC Trilogy formed one story, that we know.

But they also, III in particular, set up the future of the AC franchise, that is the escape of Juno into "the grey" and her attempted rebirth into physical form.

Black Flag was "full entry" and a true sequel to ACIII, both in number and story, following up on the aftermath of the death of Desmond, the future of the Animus program, as well as introducing Juno as the new Big Bad^TM of Chapter 2 of the AC series.

My thought is that Rogue, Unity and (especially) Syndicate are, looking back, going to form a sort of loose trilogy, setting things up for AC 2016, which will probably be a numbered entry. 

The present-day part of AC 2016 will probably focus on Juno's alliance with the Templars, and her rebirth into physical form, while the historical part will be a search for a First Civ weapon or something to kill Juno-reborn with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Operator is all but explicitly confirmed to be the Fleet Admiral from the epilogue.

As for who he is, I would put major credits on him being Vidian from *A New Dawn*

Rae Sloane kept making mention of him, and even quoting him, in the book, even though it was a somewhat insignificant incident (on a galactic scale) early in her captaincy, fifteen years prior. She would remember the events, yes; and maybe even have some memories of Vidian, but how he kept being mentioned pinged my radar.

And in *Twilight Company*, one scene early on (within first fifty pages) depicts a statue of him alongside Mas Amedda and Vader. </TEXT>

Think along the lines of if Luke failed to torpedo the Death Star, which then blew up Yavin, leaving Luke, Han, Chewie, and Wedge as the sole survivors, plus the handful of Rebels elsewhere in the galaxy to try and fight off the Empire in V and VI.

Something to that effect.

Star Wars tends to be pretty good with misdirection.

Plus, anything but a firm denial would spoil the eventual surprise. Even being wishy-washy implicitly confirms it.

	<TITLE> A thought on the future release schedule of Halo (no spoilers) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-01 06:23:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since 2009, we've had a Halo game (of one variety or another) each year.

* 09: Wars   ODST
* 10: Reach
* 11: CE Anniversary
* 12: H4
* 13: Spartan Assault
* 14: TMCC/H2 Anniversary
* 15: Spartan Strike   H5G
* 16: Halo Wars 2

Looking at the schedule, it appears that the main entries are triennial (one every three years), following the pattern of the OT (01, 04, 07), but now with spin-offs filling in the intervening years. If the pattern holds, we can probably expect Halo 6 Q4 2018.

^^NOTE: ^^Reach ^^and ^^H4 ^^break ^^this ^^pattern ^^because ^^of ^^the ^^change ^^in ^^devs, ^^but, ^^based ^^on ^^the ^^limited ^^sample, ^^it ^^otherwise ^^holds


Again, assuming the pattern holds, what might 2017's entry be?

Personally, I'd like to see an ODST-type entry based around Osiris team, perhaps their first mission together, and with the ending being a cinematic that ends right as the H5 "Osiris" opening cinematic starts.

ADDENDUM: Or, as /u/alzan27 pointed out, H3 Anniversary is probably more likely for 2017. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For the past week or two, YouTube and Netflix have been having difficulty talking to the Chromecast. Watching Netflix has become a struggle, with Netflix taking forever (if at all) talking to the Chromecast. It sometimes take three or four (or more) tries to get Netflix to talk and cooperate with the Chromecast (it cooperates in "iPod" mode).

And YouTube will often just sit on the blindingly bright red logo screen until I "trip" it by CCing HBO Go or something (which tends to cooperate)

It seems to have started about the same time the v2 launched, but it's probably just coincidence.
