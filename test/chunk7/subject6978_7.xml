	<TEXT> Just some random 35 calorie cracker, they're whole wheat. I live in a small country, I just wanted to show you do have options, and I'm sure wherever you live you can get some crackers for a very close amount of calories. Most rice cakes I know are around 35, so are lots of different crackers, maybe up to 45. I just chose something random from MFP so the point would come out clearer, since my crackers aren't available there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Directions are very simple:

Chop the egg whites of 2 hard boiled eggs. Mix in with a tablespoon of no-fat yogurt. 

Now season as you like! Some green onions or chives would be great, or paprika, something spicy, whatever you want.

Put on top of any low-cal cracker, bread, or rice cake you like. Enjoy :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still sore from the fall on Friday, so I couldn't work out.
I had a terrible day with eating. I went out for brunch when I was really way too hungry and ate a bigger meal than what I'm accustomed to. I felt very guilty for the rest of they day so I didn't want to eat anything. I was very hungry for hours. I ended up eating and still feeling bad because I ate. Very bad day </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excellent with eating thankfully, and I was proud of myself because I took food with me outside even though I wasn't sure I would need it, I ended having it for lunch, and saved some money instead of eating outside, yay! 
When I was at they gym unfortunately I couldn't finish my workout. I felt very tired and weak. I just did my squats, deadlift and shoulder press. That's it :(
I don't really know why that happened. I hope it doesn't happen again </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had eggs and toast for breakfast, for lunch tuna patties and mashed potatoes, then oatmeal with soy milk, and I made for dinner a really tasty quinoa with onion, yellow bell pepper and spinach, some green beans on the side. Munched on mandarin oranges, which are my new favorite snack. Relatively low calorie and super satisfying!
Exercise wise all I did was walk back home from the mall which is a 20 minute walk, but at least its something.
Tomorrow I've got a very important day getting into college and I'm very nervous!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finally had a good day! I went to the gym and kicked ass. I did 12 push ups (wasn't able to do even one a few months ago) and now my next challenge is to do a chin up, so I'm working on that very hard, and I got some nice exercises to reach that goal from my trainer who is very nice and always there to help even though I'm not paying for personal sessions. 
Eating wise I also had a very good day. I don't count calories because I know I would get too obsessed and would end up in an eating disorder, which happened before. So I need to trust my instinct a lot regarding things like how much protein I'm getting, am I eating enough, too much, or just the right amount? Its hard, but for me when I started losing weight it was about making a healthy lifestyle for years to come, and personally I don't think counting calories and macros fits with a healthy lifestyle, since for me it feels like dieting forever. I want to learn how to just maintain a healthy weight and healthy eating, without the help of an app. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to Barcelona for a week and didn't gain any weight. Keep in mind you should be walking around pretty much all day sight seeing, so that does burn some of the extra calories.
My advice with food is to:
1) avoid alcoholic beverages
2) drink a very big glass of water before eating, to help you feel fuller and also take care of any dehydration that might be taking place, which can often be mistaken for hunger .
3) take entrees as meals!
4) try to share big dishes with somebody else
5) don't eat too much of the regular stuff you have at home. I would skip rice and potatoes for example. Obviously this changes according to where you're from and where you're traveling to, but don't waste calories in stuff you can get at home.
6) actually ENJOY the food! Don't eat just for the sake of eating.

Now for exercise I'm not quite the expert, I would try to get a 10-15 minute run in the morning so you're not too tired from a day of sight seeing. Also maybe before going to bed you can do some bodyweight exercises

Hope this helps!

	<TEXT> Fine day eating wise, but still can't work out because my back is still sore. The good thing was that i finally bought "strong curves" by Bret Contreras and I have a feeling it'll be a great program for me. Once I move to my new house and move gym in around 3 weeks, I'll start the program from zero, and take pictures and measurements for progress comparison. I'm very excited about that! </TEXT>

The ChapStick habit for sure came from my accutane days though. Back then, I actually had to have it with me during the workout or I would die.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did not go to the gym yet again because my back is very sore, especially around the waist and lower back. I'm worried if I go to the gym I'll have bad form and it won't be good for me. Food wise it was OK. I'm very confused with how maintenance work. I've lost the weight I needed to lose. I never counted calories. Now I have no idea how much I should be eating to maintain my current weight, stop losing so I can build more muscle, and not gain any weight. I need to figure this out </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another non satisfying day went by... The gym was closed because of Passover so I couldn't go. My boyfriend offered to go on a walk together but he has some pain in his body and we didn't walk at all. So I didn't work out. Had a fine day calorie wise, but not filled with things I'd like. A bit of indulging privately here and there. My biggest weakness.. Seems like my brain thinks if nobody sees me take from the cake, I didn't actually eat. I need to find a way to work on this. </TEXT>
