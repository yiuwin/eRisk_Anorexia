	<TEXT> Nobody deserves to be in such a relationship. If your HOME, the place where you should most feel safe and loved, made you feel like that, I'm sorry to say that It wasn't a home. 

Your dad is an asshole. Dont even consider that you made a bad portrayal of him, dont make excuses for him, he is a bad person. Forcing other people to live their lives the way YOU feel they should, limiting their freedom and right to mature and grow as a person, is not love. As a guy who has been in abusive relationships with people very close to me, I tell you, DONT look back. 

Just dont, your boyfriend and his family had no obligation to help you out, because its really hard and demanding to support someone so much, but they did, that should tell you the type of people they are.

I can't stress this hard enough, do NOT excuse your father, you already have him too many chances, you are a good and caring person, and you deserve someone who respect you and loves you back.

If you hear a voice yelling you that your father does this because he loves you/Cares about you, ignore It and burrow It Deep, Thats no you, but your father pulling his strings, there is a reason why so many people fall in abusive relationships, its easy, really fucking easy to get into one, even for smart and self-conscious people, and really hard to scape, "because It wasn't that bad", yes, It was, you felt horrible enough to write this, that was a good first step, and you should keep walking in that direction, forward, always. Again, dont look back. </TEXT>

Jax... Depends a lot on the jax, If they are good and play defensively his e can give him an easy Lane, but if they ever fuck up I Crush them and snowball as much as I can from there, he is going to outscale you sooner or later, so better finish the game asap </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) You can get Protobelt If you want, but try different things, It is a bit sumoptimal

2) Nah, sheen is quite meh on him now. You can still build It if you are fed, but there are better options.

3) My aurakaiser build would suggest so

4) When you know you can carry hard, or you need to be the guy who BONKS the enemy adc to stop him.

5) Most people take flash for the flash+bonk combo, Ghost could technically work... But you cant say no to the bonk.

6) That comes to preference, both are fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm trying to make my first es character, and I'd like some advice, in particular, I'm not sure if It will be able to survive endmage content (not shaper and big shit, just tier 10-15 maps)

I should be getting:

9k-10k Es.

13% es regen + normal recharge

35% faster start of es recharge.

Chaos damage doesn't bypass es.

81/81/82% resists

12-13k Armour

Inmune to reflect

Around 30% chaos resist (being pesimist, probably some more)

Fortify.

78/78 block

Stun inmunity

Less than 200hp

Vaal discipline

Should I aim for some endurance charges? Inmortal call? Would temp chains or enfeeble make a big difference? Is freeze going to be a problem, and will some "heating" flasks solve It? </TEXT>

 Mastery is stormraiders, you always win trades as long as they cant make distance and poke you.

For tems you have a lot of options, the support tem is the most common one but I have been dark seal or boots working. For first big item I reccomend gunblade or rylai's, then whatever you fell you'll need.

	<TEXT> So I have been playing this game with my roommate four our first time. I love the lore, wandering about and sharing experiences here, so its taking some time to advance (which is fine, I'm loving It so much I dont want it to end). But hes just rushing all the content with a greatsword, which is completely fine, just a different way of enjoying the game.

Thing is, we are both complete fucking noobs, so everytime we see something new we freak out and start doing really stupid things, blightown was a lot of fun btw, and his first mimic... ye...

So he was TERRIFIED at the idea of getting invaded, he never ever used humanities. He has literally never linked a bonfire because he is so damm scared of invaders. He defeated O S with only 5 estus and no solaire.

And today, in Oolacile (I think) he just says:

John: Hey, I'm goona try some online, is this place fine?

Me: Ye, I read in the forums that its a place with a lot of activity.

John: So I take some humanity and become human at the bonfire right?

Me: Ye. You sure?

John: Kinda, I hope I dont get killed in an embarrasing way.

Inner me: Hes never playing PvP again after this right?

Me: Ye, lets see who...*Invasion*

John: OMG

Me: OMG

John: Where...

Me: LEFT, LEFT

John: wtf is he wearing in his head? Is he a troll?

Inner me: INITIATE PHASE ONE

Me: Its a strong build, he hits you even once, you die, hes tanky, but its slow.

Him: Once? Well, you say hes slow right?

Inner me: POWER UP THE BASS CANON

Me: He stunlocks you with...*parry*

John: EAT THAT SUCKER

Me: Alright, dont get overconfident, try to Dodge him, one hit is all it tak...*parry*

John: YES!

Me: Jeez, that was fast.

John: Ye, I was specting more, a bit anticlimatic.

Me: What!?

John: I mean, I didn't expect my first battle to be against a shit build. Is It really that strong? He was fucking easy.

Did he git too gud? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the kind words buddy. I have seen that few people comment in story posts (which I like to make every now and then), most will read it, downvote or upvote and leave.

Also, a lot of people are intimidated by walls of text and not even think about commenting because... reasons? They might think that their feedback isn't welcome (which it is, like... a million times more than an upvote, both positive and negative).

	<TEXT> I found the the hammer charge to be fairly easy to dodge, without Ornstein, Smough would be quit easy.

"But then why not kill Ornstein first?"

Because the first phase was (for me) harder than the second one, because you had to care about two foes, so attacking the most vulnerable target first allowed me to finish it faster, also I had no idea what Giant Smough would do, does he simply grow more and become slower? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The battle can be real BS If you aren't experienced in 1v2 fights (I play a lot of Monsters Hunter and that helped me figure It out), I think its one of the moments were Dark Souls almost crosses the line betweeen "git gud" and being unfair.

Think of it this way; you had one of your most exciting moments in this game, instead of giving up to one of the most frustating fights.

The best thing is, that with all the replay value this game has, you still can enjoy this battle has many times you want, in all the ways you want. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mt first Ornstein and Smough </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-11 22:29:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Today I made a shitty meme about this flippin duo, so to compensate, here you have the narration of how the real battle went (more or less)

I tried to beat them with my trusty spear, couldn't kill them but I got the hang of the patterns, the second attempt was far more succesfull, managed to kill Smough and drop Ornstein to 50%.

I judged I was ready, put on my gud visor, took the cristal halberd, which has helped me on the harder bosses, and stepped through the fog. I watched the cinematic yet again to better apreciate how awesome this guys are.

Smough charged first, while Ornstein was throwing is mighty lightnings, a technique thaught to him by Gwyn himself, I barely dodged them because my eyes were focused on the behemoth that was trying to crush me against the timeless slabs. He almost connected, but there is a limit to how many times you can surprise an Undead before he knows your every move, our curse, making us rise endlessly, our twisted will guiding us towards the fire, the light.

They were powerful, but so was I, and I had come to master this vaults, even more than them, this was MY time to shine.

While he recovered from the knockback, i stroke. One, two, three, four swings, a flurry of steel and flesh, cutting through a legend, who felt pain for the first time in eons. Sharpened weapons and iron boots dancing like a pencil over a paper, writing a deadly battle balad.

However, Smough was no fool, but a trained soldier, and backed away to give his partner space to attack. I barely raised my shield in time to block the spear that came towards me like a lightnings bolt.

"Is this all you have got?" My lips raised in a cocky smile, the pleasure of the one who thinks he has already win, that was my first mistake. The hall trembled again at the advance of Smough, I tried to back away, find a place to hide from the storm, only to feel the merciless walls pushing me back, there was no escape.

Impact.

How can a undead feel pain? The thing is, life is made of pain, our very first contact with the world is painful, it may seem that the shadow of torment fades away, but It never leaves, for some of us, It doesn't even after we die. A Undead is someone whose pain has been made eternal, an endless torture, and if we ever give up to the pain, we go Hollow.

I recomposed as fast as I could, my feet fighting to keep me moving, each step a struggle.

Ornstein tried to find by back, but I rolled to put a pillar between us, and while he was following me, I stabbed Smough once again. He raged, and tried to smash me, like I knew he would do, the dodge was perfectly timed, the feeling of my weapon slicing through his body, priceless. Ornstein tried to stop me, but his allie's body blocked him, giving me more time to make Smough pay for all the harm he had done to me in my previously lives. I thing Ornstein desperately yelled him to step aside while he kept me busy, but Smough was blinded by his rage.

He made a last attempt, a desperately effort from a man that could hear the whisper of death.

A final swing.

And the mountain fell.

But I knew this was only the begining of the nightmare.

Ornsteins body grew to pair his sorrow, the power of a dragonslayer.

Left, right, left, left. Defying common reason, his transformation hadnt slowed him down an inch, and he kept jumping back and forward, trying to overwelm me with his flawless technique. I raised my shield, a dwarf facing the wrath of god, and resisted the tide.

He stopped his assault, looking for an opening on my guard, without realicing that he was giving me the upper hand, I leaped forward, looking to destabilize him. If he had been familiar to his giant form, he would have crushed me, but he wasn't, and didn't know how to deal with a rat dancing between his feet, contraty to spectations, he fell in no time. By the end, he seemed to have accepted his fate, a sworn knight without his King to protect, his home and love, all consumed by darkness, his last friend dead in front of him while he tried to change his mind and save him. He wasn't killed, he was defeated, driven Hollow.

I stared at his body while it desintegrated into souls, my vision blurry. What? Never heard of an Undead crying? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the things I do to see how good a games designs are, is to think what the bosses where doing before you enter their room. If the first thing that comes to mind is something stupid, the the design for that boss is a bit lame, If its something that fits a defined personality or something cool, then the boss is good.

So for example, capra demon would be throwing sticks for his doggos to catch, iron Golem would be making super complex calculations to determine how to better throw you from the ledge when you try to block, and Quelaag would be thinking If being half Spider validates her being naked or she should wear something. Those are cool designs.

But after my first fight with the dinamic duo, I Imagined them chilling out and having a rap battle while this sounds in the background: 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CXkhfJDDxj8

I can't decide if they have the best or worst design so far in the game, is It stupid or praising the Sun level cool? What do you think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there! Your english is fine as long as it is understandable, people who say the contrary are simply not worth your time.

I'm glad you liked Morde, we do too.

Legends say that being German Increases your winrate with Mordekaiser by 20% which isnt even close to the 50% of having a Mordekaiser related summoner name, but is still nice to have.

The "most effective build" is the one that gives you the best results, full yolo ap, full tank, ap bruiser, ad bruiser, dps oriented, burst oriented... All of them can work, the amazing thing with Morde is that you can find your own style and be succesfull with it.

Thekingofelohell as quit playing league for some time because of personal reasons, so the stream of Tastypotatox is probably the best for you. He mainly plays ADC Mordekaiser with a Blitzcrank premade and is extremely good at It, I think he is currently in Master Tier. He plays a very early-mid game focushed Mordekaiser, using ghosts and rotations to overwelm the enemy team. Its a risky way of playing the game, and not everybody can do It, but give It a shot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Builds: Whatever fits you, everyone here has his own style, if you keep winning more games than you loose you are probably doing fine.

Masteries: SrS and DFT are fine. Try both. I mainly take DFT when I want to do extended trades early on. If you are fighting renek or pantheon SrS is generally better because the cant fight you without cooldowns.

	<TEXT> Metroid: Zero Mission still has (in my opinion) the best level design ever in a video game. Its not just a fun challenge, but the way the levels are built show you the different routes (normal, speedrun, reverse boss, low %) in subtle ways. Its a constant: did the designers think i'd try to... Yep, they definitely did. And what about wall jumping to reach... Yes, It works too. Wait, theres an enemy there, If I freeze It, use It has a plataform, bombjump there and shinespark here I could get to that place before intended. You thought about this, didnt you designer? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So depths was pretty damm tense but I finally made my way without dying, saving my 2 humanities (dont ask). And then...

BLIGHTOWN

"hey, I remember reading something about this place in reddit, well It certainly cant get worse than a zombi skeleton dragn, right?"

Oh foolish, foolish boy.

Fire enemies which you cant completely block. One wrong step and you fall from that one ledge you didn't saw (this one didn't happen to me but it was really close, a certain amount of times), plataforms that start shaking when you step on them, fucking eyebutt flies who are more annoying than Zelda bats. I hate this game. And of course, Venom. Every, single, fucking thing will poison you. I hate this game.

I somehow made my way to the bottom, and then I see a giant nothingness. Where the fuck do I go? I hate this game. Alright, theres all water, good thing I brought the iron ring. Not this time Miyazaki! Let's see where... WHAT!? POISON!? Who the fuck is...? No, no,no,no,no,no, FUCK. I hate this game. POISONOUS WATER!? Great... Now I'll have to spend my remaining antivenoms and... My... Remaining, 0 antivenoms. FUCK. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck"invaded by dark Spirit"FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK.

I see him coming down the stairs, if Im gonna die here, well give him a fight he sall remember, ILL BRING YOU TO HELL WITH ME! Then he stops in a plataform, and instead of going to the next ledge (on his right) he turns left, I follow him with the camera. I see something I hadnt been before, but had been there all the time, sunlight. Entering through cracks in the timeless vault, always finding a way forward, guiding us, guiding me.

He puts himself directly under the sunlight, and just from the shape of his armor I can tell what he is doing here, and what kind of person he is. Sunbro. Then he stops, and simply stands there, creating anticipation. Legs together, looking upwards, arms in 60 incandescent degrees. Praise It. Live It.

He dropped some antivenoms, one humanity, and waved in a particular direction, then he left. I followed a path i hadnt been before and found a bonfire. I love this game. 

If you are reading this, THANK YOU. I dont remember your name, but you saved this poor skeleton in the time of need. Not with sword and magic. Just with inspiration and hope, THANKS. </TEXT>
