	<TEXT> First of all ,accept that overcoming social anxiety requires patience and you couldn't become the life of a party in a matter of minutes .Secondly ,try to appear confident ( don't overanalyse what other people will think about you if you say something or inadvertently make some mistake ),take  interest in other people's lives .Begin with light chat and gradually move towards serious conversation ( awkward silences are ok and you can't be a people pleaser ) .Please remember that we are all humans ,most of us feel nervous in company of other people ( if we are introverts ) so it's nothing to worry about . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that the best tactic is to ignore this girl ,she is an attention seeker ( and actually suffering from low self esteem ).She is either trying to grab your attention or to annoy you .Just don't show that you are bothered by her childish acts .However ,after a while ,if she continues to do the same ,talk to her in order to gently remind her that she's not the centre of the world .If she want to work with you ,she'll have to mind her manners </TEXT>
