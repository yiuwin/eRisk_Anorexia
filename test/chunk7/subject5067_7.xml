	<TEXT> No reason to play ap ezreal tbh, it's good if you're smurfing because the burst is high, but when I'm going ap it still feels like im going ad, mainly because i get hextech revolver -- sheen -- lich bane -- gunblade, and max r-q-e-w

	<TEXT> First of all, gold and silver are literally the same rank.
I'm not saying that because I want to boost your confidence but because it's actually true. 

Can Ezreal carry? Yes. Ezreal can most definitely carry games, to back that statement up I have 62%+ W/R on 2 accounts with 110 games on other and 52 games on the other one, Ezreal can carry and is definitely fit to do that.. (plat 1 and plat 2, neither of them is a smurf)

While Ezreal might not hurt as much as the hypercarries, he definitely still does if ahead, and to make things easier in bronze-gold you can win your lanes by focusin on last hitting. Also when you're ahead people will most likely try to dive you through your team and your e flash will most likely save you.

When playing Ezreal in lower elos (if not smurfing, obviously.) you can use few simple tips to win
Dont poke with your autoattacks, don't e in, go for perfect cs and 0 deaths. Those will help you start off and when you get better with the matchups etc. you can develop your own style </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, EoC was an awful idea. No matter how  you look at it.. It really doesn't matter how it turned out changing a core aspect of a game is NEVER a good idea if you wish to maintain the playerbase. Removing the combat the game had had for it's entire lifespan EVEN AFTER RECEIVING THE FEEDBACK was stupid, no1 can deny that. Then again EoC lead to osrs so I can't really complain, it's just a shame that we COULD have a game that's better than neither of the ones available now. (although we could also have a game that's dead and no1 wants to play)  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yeah, so I've played the game for good 20-40 hours (rank 48 at the moment) and I've started thinking that the game seems to have very small amount of ranks?

So basically my question is, that how big skill difference is there between gold and diamond and how can it be measured well? For me it seems like only thing holding me back is the knowledge (I still haven't even learned the damn maps). I used to be Global in csgo so maybe my gunskills are a bit better than average beginner, but after reaching gold pretty much instantly and having not-so-hard time playing against platinum players I just keep wondering how much will the level increase after platinum 3 or so?  </TEXT>

so yeah, it's like a.. (hopefully people get the reference and don't get mad at me) its kinda like a more sophisticated csgo, if you get what i mean. That can probably be missunderstood really easily but if atleast one person understands me im happy haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like its useful for me.

That being said I've played for ~30 hours and need to learn the maps, I can imagine it being frustrating to veteran players who would just like to cycle through fast. 
Maybe a toggle option in 'Quality of life' section in settings or something? Other stuff could be added aswel (no suggestions atm but im sure there are plenty) 

Edit: One came to mind, maybe clicking the actual spawning points instead of the text, would make it like 1-3 seconds quicker for me. Nothing major but definitely QoL </TEXT>

Just trying to ignore it and act like they werent, but ofc im kinda asking more how they feel. Its just so strange, because i feel like i NEED to ask them how they feel, not because i actually care but because i've known them for a long time, feels like something that's just my ''chore'' to do or whatever. 
I also dont really care about people anymore, i feel like im going through some second 'teen angst' phase, exept now its not that i ''hate my parents or my life'' its just that i dont really care. I still do stuff im supposed to and am nice to people like im supposed to, but its different. Hard to explain and probably even harder to understand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So yeah I'm nearly 18 year old guy and I feel like I'm seriously lacking empathy. I feel like im lacking feelings in general.. Im certainly not depressed and i do feel stuff, happy sad etc. But whenever listening to on of my friends open up about a situation that's super fucked up i simply dont KNOW how they feel i can understand it, but i just cant say shit like ''i feel you'' because i simply dont. 

I don't feel anything when watching super graphic videos either, like someone getting killed beheaded etc. (yes, i've actually watched quite a bit of them and dont get me wrong im not some sick fuck who enjoys it i've just tried to find something that makes me feel something) 

Ive thought thus far that its just the lack of life experience, after all im still pretty young and all, but recently ive just started noticing others feel stuff around me that i dont feel.

It hasnt just recently started either, my grandfather who was really close to me died like 4 years ago or something and when i heard it i had absolutely no emotional reaction to it, my mind literally said 'ok' and moved on? Obviously i tried to act shocked since my dad told me it and so on but i dont know if he realized that i felt nothing or not..

Im kinda lost with this? What should i do? Am i ok? 
Also, sorry if this doesn't belong here since im not actually depressed, im kinda lost, will delete if needed.

ps. Thanks greatly to anyone who even read it.  </TEXT>

And also, if you play because you enjoy the gaming experience and they play because they enjoy getting high ranks then obviously there's going to be difference.

Played ezreal for around 300 games but i've just never tried these 2. The reason I started being interested is that when i tried it I had a lot better time playing against tanks and they couldn't catch me and if they could they just didn't have enough damage to kill me :P </TEXT>

You managed to do it while it was hard. Kinda like killing some wow raid bosses when they weren't nerfed (dont know too much about that but i'd assume ya'll know these games) it was super hard and just because its not anymore doesn't mean the ''accomplishment'' to kill it back then is devalued. </TEXT>
