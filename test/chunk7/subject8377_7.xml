	<TEXT> He has a point, but then he also doesn't. The subculture is a stereotype - one that most of us don't prescribe to in our daily lives. He's making it sound like being gay is 'abnormal' and that we all have to use special language and like special things. Like you know what, I watch Rupaul's Drag Race and I also listen to metal and build computers as a hobby. Aside from Grindr, I'm incredibly out of touch with the LGBT community. Like honestly, I can't name 5 actors who are gay, nor singers for that matter. But you know what, he'd probably be singing a different tune if he was gay and not bi and married to a woman. We are an incredibly oppressed minority, it's comforting to have a subculture make its mark on society and it's comforting to know successful people and celebrities who are like us. Also, what is stopping him from saying that straight friends who all act the same aren't prescribing to a subculture? Why is he saying that they are 'normal'? I'm not saying this as a liberal/left-wing, but you know, if it smells like internalised homophobia

I'm with Belletrix on this one. It honestly doesn't sound like this guy has interacted with LGBT people, but rather, just took a look at the stereotype of the community and cast us all as being cut from the same cloth. It's like when someone is a Republican and people assume they are idiots and anti-gay etc, it's a stupid generalisation. No one is forcing anyone to prescribe to an artificial 'subculture', it's him who needs to wake up and see the world for what it is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My partner and I opened up our relationship about 2 years after we got married. We are perfectly happy with being monogamous - an open relationship for us is a perk. We can indulge in it when we like, how often and how little as we please, sometimes we go 4 or more months only sleeping with each other. The important rule we have is that we are happy together and that we, as a couple, matter more than having an open relationship and other people. In other words, if we want to change back into a strictly monogamous relationship, we would both be happy with that - it wouldn't change a thing.

We are also very honest with each other. We tell each other who we plan to hook up with and where, and we reserve the right to veto it. If one of us says no, we don't get hurt or annoyed, just shrug it off. We are extremely open about it, the key to an open relationship is strong communication and still making your partner feel like they are basically your one and only. This certainly isn't for everyone. Different people make different rules. For one, we don't allow seeing the same person regularly and we are very strict about safe sex - some couples in open relationships don't care on this part. 

From my experience, open relationships didn't spice up our relationship per se, we were always really passionate about each other. But it did allow us to explore kinks like cuckolding and I really enjoy threesomes/groupsex. He gets turned on when I talk about the other men I've been with, and when he talks about his, it really switches on the D part of my BDSM with him. But I mean, if you go into this thinking it is going to make sex better or make your relationship that little bit more raunchy...it really won't unless you already have that spice there.  </TEXT>

The 'doctor' who headed the study had his medical license revoked and failed to disclose where he got his funding from, which was from a group who were against vaccinations and essentially paid a researcher to create fake results on a study to support their position.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We live in a society where coming out is reserved for gay or bi people because everyone else is straight and straight is 'normal'.

I actually never came out to my parents. They were both pro-gay and I have a gay uncle on each side, both of whom are valued in our family. It was all, "Oh your Uncle Nikolai is bringing his boyfriend to your dance recital." or "Your Uncle Hiro is still waiting to find a good man to bring with him when he comes to visit." etc etc. Gayness was so normalised to me. And my parents never made me feel like I had to say I was gay, they never sat me down and gave me the it's okay to be gay speech or that I needed to tell them because they didn't care that kid me wanted to marry a prince. When I was 12 my dad gave me the 'talk' and then put a gay sex book into my lap and left with a letter from one of my uncles.

So eh. I don't think straight kids will necessarily come out. Their parents might have a conversation about sexuality and the kids might mention their orientation but when raised in a society where straightness is normalised and by parents who don't care what sexuality their kids have, really doubt they will 'come out'. Unless the kids end up being anti-gay, pro-Christian assholes </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but hear me out: I re-watched a lot of the episodes and a lot of the top 3 basically coasted into the position by not losing, but also not necessarily winning either. That's kind of the issue with DR - if a good queen fucks up once, they are booted out. But if a mediocre queen stays mediocre, they can win or come close to winning. I think it has to do partly because of our favourite queens being risk takers and avant garde, but also working really hard that they are bound to burn out on one challenge. 

The funny thing about queens like Detox and Katya is that twice they have been so close to winning, but just barely missed out. Aside from Chad and Bianca, the winners to me were unpredictable throughout the season. Still though, as with any publicity, in large part it is an opportunity to sell yourself to the public with a perk of potentially winning some cashmoneydollars. Look at Laila McQueen. She's living! </TEXT>

A lot of people I know who are on Truvada wish they didn't have to be. My step mother for example - she developed high blood pressure, high cholesterol, bone problems, kidney and liver problems and weight fluctuations, and she is actually a fairly healthy woman (eats right, works out - but the medications gave her problems). I'd only recommend PrEP to people who don't use condoms and think they are somehow immune to HIV or to partners of HIV+ people. If you are hoping that by taking it you can go condom free, you're doing it for the wrong reasons.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gender dysphoria is considered a mental disorder, however this is being debated because disorder implies that it can be rectified in some means via medication and cognitive therapy. It can't be. The only way it can be is by allowing an individual to transition which really brings an interesting dilemma to the table - is it a 'mental' disorder, or are they perfectly fine mentally, but their body etc was somehow interfering. There is a lot of grey in this area and psychologists don't treat gender dysphoria as a mental disorder,  but rather a context for which certain issues can be prevalent such as depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia (which is what gender dysphoria is becoming to be replaced with) etc </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not so much how long you have had the infection as much as it is how aggressive or large the infection/how much bacteria there is. I once had a UTI, only had it for two weeks but it spread to my kidneys and I was hospitalised. Some people have UTI and don't need to go on antibiotics at all. It all really depends. But if you are concerned about fertility your doctor should review how much bacteria grew. However, infertility is quite rare when you are treated, and even so it is still fairly uncommon when left untreated for a long time. You need to develop epididymitis in order to have a chance at infertility. You will be fine, but then again I am a surgery nurse, not a reproductive specialist, but if I remember correctly from my studies, chlamydia is often left undiagnosed and it's these cases that have the elevated risk of infertility  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand. It's why therapy took me 4 years. But it's much better to tell them now so they can help you rather than the pain eat away at you and make you do something terrible. I attempted suicide twice, the second time I gave myself anorexia to starve myself to death. You never want to get to that stage and I would never wish it upon anyone. I know it's hard, but what is so much harder is the pain keeping these feelings away and not being able to talk about it. Your therapist is there to help you, they don't need to know in full detail what happened, they just need enough to know how you are feeling and how conflicted you are. Just letting them know drugs were involved and that the experience was traumatic plus how it has negatively affected your life, sex and your relationships. It's a common misconception that therapists need every details. They don't, they just need the important bits that will help them diagnose and treat you. 

And you are definitely not weak. You are much stronger than I was. You got into therapy, you quit drugs. These are extremely commendable things. You ought to give yourself more credit because there are so many of us not braves enough to have that ability to try to get better. And don't feel bad about being unable to open up. That's what therapy is about, slowly getting you capable of opening up so they can then help you. You need to relearn to trust people about very intimate details like your emotions and fears. This is not easy, but each session brings you closer to healing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yes, I should also mention that I had extensive therapy (about 4 years, still taking meds 8 years on) which helped a lot. I wasn't like you, I was destructive and became a sex addict because I desperately tried to regain control. The first time I actually had proper sex where I wasn't being destructive was devastating and I kept crying and was actually terrified, like I felt vulnerable and that was scary. Over time, with a lot of therapy and with my partner I learned to actually enjoy sex and to open myself up in sex, rather than just be I don't know, lusty? Really aggressive? It was a weird time in my life. But no, I do get you. 

Just don't be an idiot like me and stick to the therapy. If you get diagnosed with PTSD or anything don't start thinking you're a psycho and nothing can help you. You're on a path to recovery and you are so blessed to have someone helping you with this who is trying their best to understand. What may be beneficial, and certainly helped us a lot as a couple, is couple's therapy. You don't have to be married, but it really does help to have someone with you on this journey. Best of luck to you and I wish you all the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the critiquing has become a little shallow, but then again the competition has gotten tougher in my opinion. I do think a lot of it is editing, it's easier and takes much less time to make Michelle say mean things and Ross or Carson say nice things than show them saying both mean and nice things (and I use the term mean here liberally). 

Someone who I think would have survived longer in a different season is Tempest Dujour - fell in love with her, and not just because I too am a married gay man who really wants kids. She's so passionate and sweet and had so much to offer. Also, Ben DeLaCreme. Please come back! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I got married I thought we would be strictly monogamous, but then we had a civil conversation about 2 years after and decided to basically open up our relationship. That was 3 years ago - we are still married and we switch between being monogamous and being non-monogamous whenever we feel, the key is that we keep open communication, make it clear when we want to stop and make it clear when we disapprove of a partner etc and we respect each other's opinion. At the end of the day, we will both be perfectly happy being monogamous, opening up the relationship to hookups is a perk, and it's not one we indulge in often, in fact, we've been monogamous for like 5 months before January because we just didn't feel like fucking other people. Since we opened it up, he's hooked up with 4 different people, and I around 15-20 (I enjoy threesomes, also my husband likes the idea of being a cuckold). This kind of relationship works for us, because we will both be happy with each other and can see ourselves being monogamous in the future and we both mutually agreed with equally keen interest to open it up. We don't get emotional or jealous or accusatory if one us says "okay no hook ups for a while." Or "I really don't want you to bang that guy/bang someone right now." You should be the number one priority, remember that.

It is possible to make an open relationship work, but it takes a lot of trust and a lot of communication and a lot of equalness. If you aren't interested and he is, and if you feel uneasy about it, then it won't work. In my mind he should be respecting your wishes to not, especially if you have been monogamous for so long and had planned to enter a monogamous marriage. Do what feels right for you honey, but have a good chat with him. Let him know how you feel and ask him why he brings it up now and why he wants to etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A dermatologist may prescribe a topical hydroquinone, you will have to be careful to only apply to the freckles though because it is a skin lightener. You can also have intensive vitamin C treatments, less harsh on the skin, but they do take a while to show results. Lastly, you can have laser depigmentation which is what I did to treat melasma. For any of these methods, you will need to stay out of the sun for at least 48 hours from time of application and to apply sunscreen to the area always. Since I had mine done, I will burn quickly unless I use SPF 50++ (UVA/UVB). I didn't use to sunburn so easily before, but now I do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know how you feel actually. I am a rape survivor and my partner, when he found out, basically wrapped me up in cotton and tried really hard to protect me. Like at times it does feel annoying, like it sort of makes you feel hopeless, useless and like some little weakling that needs to be protected. Have a chat with him, but do let him know you appreciate what he is doing, just that unknowingly he is making you feel more isolated and more like a broken victim than you need or want to feel because let's face it, we all want to move on and having accomodations made for us victims can feel like the sexual abuse is 'winning' in a way. I don't know how to explain it, it's a weird and very conflicted feeling, but I think you get it. 

Having positive sex with my partner who I loved, in a weird way, was quite healing. There is no better way to move on than to fix a bad experience by making a bunch of good new ones IMO. He is being very protective, and so would anyone who loves you dearly when they learn of sexual abuse. Just let him know you need freedom too because the experience you had was a violation of your freedoms, restricting you and wrapping you in cotton is nice and all, but suffocating </TEXT>

It's relationships like OP is in where opening up the relationship is treated like a logical progression where you will have problems - open relationships don't solve problems in the bedroom, they create them </TEXT>

	<TEXT> N-9 is spermicide. It's not a surprise it would lead to micro-abrasions of the rectum, it does so in the vagina as well. But I have never heard of gay men seeking out spermicide - it incidentally happens to be in a lot of lube and in almost all condoms.  :\ 

The second study does not have the means to differentiate between types of lubricant, but does suggest that water based lubricant increases STI odds relative to oil or silicone based. I'd be interested to know if that is because certain water-based lubes contain N-9 or because water-based lubes dry out faster you will get micro-abrasions and increased condom breakage from friction. 

These studies were not so much concerned about why lube will increase STIs, but rather whether it is worth implementing a microbicide into lubricant to hinder the spread of disease (which researchers are doing atm).  </TEXT>

You can start with an AHA product, have a look at Paula's Choice if you are in the US. They have some really lovely AHA and BHA products - AHA is for acne, BHA is for blackheads and oil. You may need to use both. I recommend getting an AHA toner and/or treatment.

	<TEXT> I grew up in Moscow in the 90s and early 2000s - the whitest fucking place on the planet. Still, my first boyfriend was a black guy in the US (went there for ballet school) and my second boyfriend who I am now married to is white. I actually did not find white guys to be attractive, I preferred black, middle eastern and Indian guys more attractive. And I still do find more black men attractive than I do white guys. It's one thing to say it is based on who you grew up with, but I also think because I didn't grow up with the racial stereotypes they have in the West about black people being subversive and Indians and Middle Eastern men being unattractive chauvinists. I grew up in a place during a time which was desperately trying to embrace new cultures after the Soviet Union dissolved. So yes, racism is the culprit here and ignorance can still be racism. 

Still though, I think preference and outright saying that X ethnicity is unattractive is racist and is a broad generalisation. I didn't particularly find Asians to be attractive, but then K-Pop and J-Pop became a thing and HELLO!!! People just need to be a little more open minded and unfortunately the porn industry which is predominantly made of white people is not helping. Granted, I do have my preferences, but I'm not going to put them on my Grindr profile, because let's be real. If a hot guy is hot, I'm sucking his dick, regardless of where his ancestors came from.  </TEXT>

I can't imagine a lot of people actually being turned off by it when seeking an actual relationship - hook ups may because well, it's just the way hook up culture is, it's all about nabbing that 'perfect' guy to fuck and then forget tomorrow. Granted, this is coming from someone married to a guy who had been in a wheelchair for almost 3 years with us being told it may be permanent. If someone is determined to love you, what you see as a flaw may not even register as such to them. Since it seems you want a long term relationship, maybe just mention it as an aside or a cool fact when that totally interesting question pops up during a date. 

Best wishes for nabbing your dream man, and don't sweat it. I'm certain you are overthinking it because I bet your personality and your other amazing qualities will win anyone over.  </TEXT>
