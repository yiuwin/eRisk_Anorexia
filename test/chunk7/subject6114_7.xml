	<TEXT> Look, I've been killed on here for my opinion concerning the Chris vs. Mousasi; check the record. I get why. Was Chris trying to game the system? Probably. Moose is probably right when he says that he didn't want to fight. Hell, deep down I thought that Chris didn't want to fight Moose anymore, when I was watching it live. He wanted to be done. It was heart breaking to watch. He's been my favorite fighter since he's been in the UFC, the only fighter--other than Nate--that inspired me to buy clothing to represent them. I could go on about how he's been my boy and he's still my boy. Still, with full knowledge of my bias, I think he was screwed out of the opportunity to get finished in a dignified manner. It's sad for me to see him sit on the canvas and basically acknowledge that he wanted out of the fight; and I can't get over the fact that Dan Miragliotta put him in that shitty position, twice.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He wasn't diagnosed with anything. It was determined that he was unfit to continue, but no one ran concussion testing on him, we haven't received results from a brain scan (which really can't tell you 100 percent if he had a concussion, but it's better than what we have), and he didn't get knocked out (which is a sign that you almost definitely had a concussion). To say he had a concussion is to assume he had a concussion. Just like to say he's faking it is to assume he was faking it. These are all things we don't know. These are armchair analysis opinions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BINGO! Also, using what happened last night as evidence for the new rule working is dumbest thing I've read all day. Sometimes this sub astounds me. People get upvoted for making assumptions, other people get downvoted for stating facts, nobody gets upvote/downvoted for the reason that the system is in placed.

If you think Chris Weidman was diagnosed with a concussion in that octagon, you need to do some research on concussions. If you think other fighters won't try to game the system, or use the rules to their full beneift, you're naive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As /u/Charlie_Steve  mentioned, he has a negative net rating. That also matches the eye test. Bertans is not a good defender. Currently, he is not even a serviceable defender in my opinion. If we see him improve in that area, he will get more minutes from Pop. I'm not completely sold on him. I'm wondering if he has the lateral quickness to play defense on the elite level. I'm wondering how much the acl injury has hindered his ability to play good defense.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. The issue is not about what is most moral, it's about whether he has a case. The doctor go called in as a response to a blunder by the ref, not as a direct response to the knee. Because the situation in which the doctor entered the ring was incorrect, The Chris has cause to be upset. Under normal circumstance, what happens? The fight continues until Dan calls it. I think The Chris deserves to lose the fight or win it under the normal sanctioned rules of MMA. He deserve the same opportunity that every fighter gets in that situation. He clearly wasn't KO'd, so big Dan wasn't go to call the fight there. It's the refs fight to call.

On top of that, Dan looked at the reply, so the fight got called a TKO. You can say it all comes out in the wash if you want to feel better, but two fuck ups by Dan was the reason the fight got stopped and then called a TKO, regardless if the knee is legal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He never claims he faked it. The issue is the doctor wasn't supposed to be there at all. The pretense is false. If Dan wasnt calling the fight, The Chris should have had the opportunity for this adrenaline to kick in and fight back, that's what's fair.

	<TEXT> The action should have continued. That's what should have happened, and since it didn't, and since the Chris didn't get an opportunity to fight back or get finished, he most definitely got screwed. Stopping the fight at all was the incorrect call, if Dan was not stopping it because the Chris was out. Did Chris stop the fight himself? No. He had no choice in the matter... To me this seems straight forward. If someone makes a decision against the rules that directly causes you to lose the fight, you got screwed.  I'm sure everyone on here would feel screwed in that position.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't agree with this at all. If you're working for a company that uses the media as leverage in negotiations, then you pretty much have to pay them back in kind. There are more media opportunities pre-fight to get this news out. It also puts pressure on the UFC if Gegard goes and wins this fight. Gegard has a lot of pressure regardless--he is getting in a cage and fighting a man after all. I don't think it provides that much added pressure. There's pressure to win at the end of a contract no matter what. Too often people get this notion that we need to cater to businesses and their feelings at the cost of the employee. The business, within a market economy, automatically has a leg up on the employee. If the UFC is getting negative publicity about fighter pay, it is because the company is giving fighters reason to bring it up, and if they are bringing it up for good reason I don't give a damn when they do it. If the company is going to contact him about his contract two weeks out of a fight, Moose can bring up his contract a week later. </TEXT>

Also, in case you didn't realize, you made the video for it to be viewed. You wanted as many clicks as possible, and the title is a part of that. 

 I put Kawhi's name first is because most /r/nba readers will skip a post if they don't recognized the first name

It's the same principle as marketing. You admitted you used Kawhi's name first for clicks. It's a click bait title; just own it and move on. Nothing to get frustrated about.  </TEXT>

or
 Selden played very well against one of the best in the league, Kawhi Leonard

I like it. Those are good titles. Selden's name should be first if we are praising him. I don't know much about him. Sell Selden! The way it is, and the narrative that is trying to be sold, it is all clickbait to me. I just don't know why this sub demands that everything be a zero-sum proposition. I think Harden, Westbrook, and Kawhi deserve the MVP for different reasons, yet if the conversation comes up, we must criticize the other two to prop up our favorite.  It's all very strange to me. How can you discredit any of their seasons, especially Harden and Westbrook, but that's what we do.  </TEXT>

You know why he wasn't on him... because they were switching. 



Sorry my title didn't cater to your delicate sensibilities.

The title is suppose to sell what ever you're trying to sell in the article or, in this case, the video. In the link, it gets shortened as Kawhi Leonard held in check by rookie wayne. Is that the most important part of your video? That Kawhi Leonard was held in check, or that Selden played great defense. That's how titles work. It is what your leading with, and you decided to lead with Kawhi Leonard held in check. We also define holding someone in check differently. If that guy is going to score 7 more points, with one of them being a game tying FG within 4.9 seconds of regulation, you didn't hold him in check within that small window. You also don't hold him in check when you are requiring help defense on most of the plays you showed. That's just reality. No one brags about holding a guy in check when he is basically one of the major reasons you lost down the stretch. Your title is biased, the way to sold it is biased, and I am biased. If you don't realize that, that's on you.

	<TEXT> Kawhi ended with 32 points, including a shot that tied the game with 4.9 seconds left. On the final Spurs play, Selden decided not to switch, and they doubled Leonard, leaving Aldridge with an uncontested layup. I think Selden was supposed to switch on that play because they were switching on everything down the stretch. So lets not create a false narrative here. Details matter. I would have much preferred the title: Wayne Selden plays great defense on Kawhi down the stretch. Instead of, Kawhi Leonard held in check by rookie. The Spurs won that game because Kawhi Leonard was on the floor. The reason I say this is because now you have people commenting how Kawhi sucks at offense. Suffice to say, a false narrative is probably unintentionally being created by misleading titles and editing. 

You could certainly praise Selden without criticizing Kawhi.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He had 32 points in this game and hit the shot with 4 seconds to go that would have forced over time. What's more, he was involved in the play that caused him to get double-teamed (Selden chose not to switch), and allowed Alridge to get an open lay-up that actually forced overtime. He's the best offensive player on the team with the second best record in the entire NBA. He's the last player since David Robinson to average 26ppg or more for the Spurs. He beat Lebron in every game they played this year, averaging more points during those games. The last time they met in the finals, Kawhi Leonard was MVP. Please tell me more about how he's not an elite offensive player.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Manning place does not have the size to jack atm. No one is going to tag up with us to create manning face just to spite the void. We will all go in with our small numbers and get slaughtered. This ain't no game, son. Manning place is better off battling the Mormons until a better plan comes along, but yours ain't it. Manning place will grow because people like manning face. Period.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since Pop has been the coach, the Spurs have had a player average over 7 assists twice (Tony Parker 7.7, 7.6). The Spurs have never had anyone average over 8 assists. It's not the way the system works. It is a system predicated on ball movement, not having one guy set up his teammates. Ideally, the ball moves within a few dribbles/seconds max. The seasons that Tony average over 7, the offense was based more on him penetrating and kicking out to the open shooters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope I don't get killed for this, but I'd love to see some defensive statistic concerning Davis. I want to see if the stats match the eye test. It seems to me that he's our worst defense player, and he has a real problem moving his feet and moving laterally. He can't seem to get out and contest shots on the perimeter. I'm glad he got his minutes now, because I'm not sure I want to see much of him in the playoffs. He's just too much of a defensive liability. Good win today. </TEXT>

It's funny how you called him a dumbass in a paragraph that has grammar errors--errors that you likely don't even know you that you made. You might need [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

You can call someone an idiot for possibly making a typo, but if you ask me, misspelling a word is not as bad as not knowing what a comma splice is. The latter is surely an education failure.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bertans is a defensive liability. People blow right past him. He has very little lateral quickness. I think that has something to do with the ACL injury. Bertans can be effective in short minute situations, but I really don't see him filling into a peak-Bonnar role. We'll see. He also seems a bit out of control when he's on the court.  </TEXT>
