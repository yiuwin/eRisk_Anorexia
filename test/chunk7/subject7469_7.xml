	<TEXT> Hey guy,

I have read the current comments in this thread an these is some good general advice in there.

Speaking more from your step sons perspective, he just needs to know you care and are available. This is the hard part because it can take a while.

I've been where he is, i was a man child playing games all the time. I appreciated peoples concern a little bit. Although sometimes it sounded like all everyone was ever telling me was that I had an issue with games.

The real issue was I had no idea how to aproach real life, in a what the hell to do with my life kind of way.

I am an aussie, and over here 18 is the legal drinking age. So it's when a lot of people say that you are an officially an adult. 18 was 10 years ago for me now,   and i still don't feel like a real adult. I doubt he does at all as well. 

I'd say that the early twenties does not mean what it used to mean 20 years ago. Most likely all his online mates are in similar positions and he does not feel the need to change from what he is doing at all. 

Hope I have helped a bit with insights from his perspective.
