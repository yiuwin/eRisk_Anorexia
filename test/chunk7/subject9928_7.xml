	<TEXT> 990 books, 23 :) A library in use, of course, though I rather stick in countless bookmarks than to write in the margins (brought up this way, actually in favour of marginals). The bulk is in (my native) German, about 40 volumes in English, about ten each in French and Italian, four in Catalan and three more oddballs in languages I don't speak. There are a bit less than a hundred from before 1945 and maybe one or two dozen from the 19th century: Some very cheap paperbacks (published lecture notes and the like), but also a few select very beautiful tomes.
I bought a lot of these books myself, but the still bigger amount came in through lots of luck. Once, for example, my school library  itself an outstanding one, a real scientific library, the like of which I've never seen in any other state school, had sorted its shelves and threw out hundreds "outdated" books, from which we could take as many home as we wanted. Over the course of a few weeks I took as home literally as many as I could carry (the way to school was 20km by train and bus, and 2km by foot). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pro tip: To maximise battery life, use your laptop as support for the heavy book you're reading, also in order to spread out the weight more evenly. </TEXT>
