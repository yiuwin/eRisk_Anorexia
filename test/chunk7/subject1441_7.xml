	<TEXT> Id like to add to this that getting a good conversation going at meals has been really helpful for me. Also, having a fun activity for after meals as a distraction- my mom and I play scrabble. It helps me sit with the full feeling and relax a little bit. I struggle to buy food so having the grocery shopping done is helpful. My mom said that reading Life Without ED was really helpful for her to get her to understand my perspective. I'm 22 and live with my mom, so similar situation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I e been recovering for 9 months. I gained weight in an out patient setting for a few months and then had a major relapse. The biggest health issue I had was my heart rate became extremely slow. I ended up being hospitalized for it. The doctor told me that I could either admit myself or I would be forced in. That was really really scary because I realized how horrible I had been to myself. They were afraid my heart would stop in my sleep. Now I was underweight, but not ridiculously so (bmi 17.4). So for me, I definitely cannot maintain an underweight bmi and be healthy. My heart rate stayed low until about bmi 19. I'm female, only purged once, but did have a strong exercise compulsion. 

Overcoming the fear of weight gain for me was really motivated by fear. In addition to my heart problems, they determined that my kidneys were struggling too. The only way to be okay was to eat what they gave me and gain weight. I was medically stabilized in the hospital and then sent to a PHP program. Exposure therapy to fear foods and DBT skills to deal with the distress was key for me. 

I am now happy to report that I am out of the hospital setting and working with outpatient. I'm a really bad gainer, so I still have a few pounds to gain, but a lot of the fear from that has dissipated. Having an excellent therapist has been key for me. I was also diagnosed with a comorbid OCD so taking my meds and doing exposure therapy for that has also lessened the anxiety that went with my ED. 

Lifting has also helped me. It channels the exercise compulsion in a way that lets me build muscle as I gain and not destroy my heart. That being said, once I'm weight restored, I do plan to go back to some cardio activities. I just legitimately love them too much. Moderation. 

My advice to you is that if you have inklings that you could develop and ED, find a therapist with ED experience immediately. Recovery is hell. It's possible but it sucks. The sooner you catch it, the better off you will be.  </TEXT>

A warning sign for me is also feeling exceptionally guilty for eating things normal, fit individuals wouldn't. And getting too rigid regarding my workouts.

	<TEXT> First off, congrats on doing all that hard work!  I really think you should fully restore. Most people should just because leading ED specialists believe that it reduces your risk of relapse. You have a little bit of a buffer and are still far from overweight. 

I would especially urge you to fully restore as a young man. There is a chance you'll grow some more as your body accepts the nutrition and isn't afraid of starving and they weight will allow that. At the very least, you'll be naturally putting on muscle until your early twenties at least and will want the restoration to aid in that process. It sucks to eat extra, I know. But you're almost there! </TEXT>

But then when I talked to my mom, I felt so so so much better which dissolved any anger I had with waves of gratitude. Our friendship has since disappeared which is really sad to me but, at least on my end, it had nothing to do with her "outing" me. I am and forever will be eternally grateful for that. Even if she never talks to me again. 

She's a redditor, and if she happens to be reading this, I just want to send out a thank you for saving my life and I hope you are doing well.  </TEXT>
