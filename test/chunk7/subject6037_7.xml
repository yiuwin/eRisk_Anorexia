	<TEXT> There is both a book, "Death or Canada" (https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/death-or-canada-the-irish/9782896461295-item.html?ikwid=death+or+canada ikwsec=Home ikwidx=0) and a two part film of the same name (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_or_Canada) made about this time period and the events surrounding it here in Toronto.

There are also other resources in Toronto including various plaques that reference Michael Power and his role in the famine, the burial grounds and the location of the fever sheds. A display of artifacts recovered from the archeological dig at John and King where the sheds were located are now preserved in the TIFF Lightbox library, which is located at the former site.

World respected scholar on this issue, Mark McGowan who wrote the book is faculty at the University of Toronto. 

It's very sad that this important part of our history is seemingly not taught in our schools nor are these resources used for educational purposes.

	<TEXT> I am also a descendant of the Irish potato famine immigrants.

I posted a comment about the buried famine victims at this location in the "Random Fact Most People Wouldn't Know" thread on this sub a few weeks back:

https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/5kmu7g/post_a_random_toronto_fact_most_people_wouldnt/

It doesn't look like this article was taken from there as there is another focus driving this recent most piece.

However, I would like to add that several years ago (2011) there was an article on the Star (https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/08/05/grave_injustice_aboriginal_group_decides_not_to_build_on_possible_catholic_graveyard.html) about an Aboriginal community group that had been considering building a facility at this site. They declined as they considered it disrespectful to disturb the site as this has been done to their people before. 

I hope the same consideration is taken again this time around.

Edit: spelling and grammar. </TEXT>

Yes, but the dress in that wiki photo doesn't look like the black dress in the screenshot. Additionally, it's described in the text as the "normal-wear" of a cardinal - and the screenshot is not taken during a formal meeting of the cardinals with the pope, which is why the rest of them don't look like that. I think that /u/bullittstng is right when he says that's an eastern cardinal, not what you describe.

At this link, http://www.catholicregister.org/features/item/13836-vestments-and-symbols-of-the-office-of-the-cardinal you'll see an image about 1/3 down on the page. It describes the 'simar', a black robe worn by cardinals at non-liturgical events. It looks more like the first image in this post but not the second. 

But now I don't remember what was shown in the episode! Which of the two images you've shared looks the most like the one you saw on the show? </TEXT>

Good point, though her wrists and arms were covered up. I also considered a prior drug habit or perhaps jokingly checking to see that she hadn't gotten engaged since last he saw her.

I initially thought of drugs but realized later there's no way they would have left their daughter in school in Toronto when they relocated up north if this were an issue. Also I would think that they might be concerned that she's potentially bipolar as well given the hereditary factors with that illness. 

This scene was shot on the grounds of Bishop Strachan, which is a private girls school in Toronto. I'm not sure if we're supposed to know this or not. BTW, they drank their coffee in a place called "Snakes and Lattes" on College St., also in Toronto. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe I'm being dense, but I don't see anything in that section that describes this particular dress. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)#Vesture_and_privileges

There are four images at this link. Two show cardinals wearing red, one in black and the other in white. Below the image with the cardinal in black it states:

"Cardinal Pell wearing the ordinary dress of a cardinal: black cassock with scarlet (red) piping and buttons, scarlet fascia (sash), pectoral cross on a chain, and a scarlet zucchetto"

And the following description of all four outfits is provided:

"When in choir dress, a Latin-rite cardinal wears scarlet garments  the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal's willingness to die for his faith.[43][44] Excluding the rochet  which is always white  the scarlet garments include the cassock, mozzetta, and biretta (over the usual scarlet zucchetto). The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color, but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates. Until the 1460s, it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business. His normal-wear cassock is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia (sash). Occasionally, a cardinal wears a scarlet ferraiolo which is a cape worn over the shoulders, tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front, without any 'trim' or piping on it.[45] It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such.[citation needed]"

What does everyone think about Cardinal? Does he know he's under investigation? Is he corrupt or will his 'shady' ways be explained away?

I'm not sure about his daughter and the hands. I'm guessing she goes to a private school because of the uniform (well, really the knee socks). Is it possibly she was sent away to school because of behavioural issues? Other than that I have nothing.  </TEXT>

His reign was in the WWII period so his story is interesting and somewhat controversial.

The role of the Vatican during WWII was very interesting. Because Vatican City is a technically a country with its own currency, government, etc. it was able to declare itself neutral during the war thus (unofficially) acting a safe haven. 

See for example the film, "The Scarlet and the Black" (short description: "Defying a Nazi colonel (Christopher Plummer), Vatican Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty (Gregory Peck) hides thousands of escaped POWs in occupied Rome"). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guessing here but I wonder if the Young Pope is a Jesuit (as in that's his particular religious order). The Jesuits have their own Pope, sort of, known as the Black Pope who wears black vestments. I was wondering if this group of cardinals are Jesuits and therefore dressed in black.

You'll notice that the nuns are often dressed in different habits. These reflect the specific religious order they belong to. It seems like they are making an effort to distinguish amongst the nuns.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think what you're referring to is a single bed. Others have been seen sleeping in these (e.g., the napping nuns). 

In my experience these beds are commonly used for children. Given that priests and nuns have taken a vow of chastity they have no need for a double or larger size bed as they sleep alone.

I believe we've become accustomed to seeing larger beds for adult characters in film and television whether they are married on not. I'm guessing this is because people assume these characters are sexually active whether the story line portrays this or not. Seeing all of these single beds in the Young Pope has been a bit odd. </TEXT>

1. Why was this episode with only Arizona, Bailey and Jo? Were the other actors on vacation or was it just a 'coincidence' due to how the writers wanted to write this episode?

From a medical perspective the purpose of the episode was to tell a story about a woman in prison with a high risk pregnancy - hence Arizona. From a personal perspective Jo and Bailey were brought along to interact with Arizona and each other as character development. The writers may have something further down the road for Bailey with respect to prisons.


2. Why did Bailey offer Dr. Eldredge a job and vice versa? I somewhat understand why Eldredge would offer Bailey a job, but the other way around? There weren't (IMO) really any indications that Eldredge was a particularly good doctor, even less so a surgeon?

It was an effort to show mutual respect. Bailey learned about the implications of practising medicine in an underfunded prison and Eldredge respected Bailey's clinical skills. Eldredge barely gets to practise medicine because she's bogged down with bureaucracy and unruly patients but she still does her best to make it work. I'm sure it's a brutal environmental to work in. 

3. Is this an accurate portrayal of maximum security hospitals? I've never heard of the concept before (non-US here) and I'm baffled the way it was portrayed as something of a prison hospital.

I know many shows get a lot of flak for not portraying things accurately. I don't work in a prison hospital but I'd assume the writers did their research. Nothing they showed in the prison hospital was unexpected or unrealistic in my opinion.

4. Is it just me or was there a (not-so-)subtle reference between Eldredge - "Eldritch" and her nature as a monstruous keeper-doctor? 

I didn't notice that but I presume it's possible.

	<TEXT> No question this is shot beautifully. So much so I looked up the cinematographer. Turns out it's Steve Cosens:

http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181767/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr13

He also did Durham County, which was also visually striking and some other productions I've seen (e.g., Tracy Fragments). 

I have not read the book so I can't comment on that. 

I'm seeing some obvious tv tropes here with the main character Cardinal (man with a past, man with a secret, man with a sick wife, etc.) along with the overall storyline (murder mystery in small town, divisive community, threats from outsiders, etc.) but thus far I think the story telling is intriguing enough that I'll continue to watch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Season 2 was also my favourite. 

I attribute this to growing up in a city with a large manufacturing base and union movement. I grew up with guys like those portrayed working at the docks. They weren't Polish but from another immigrant minority population with strong religious ties.

I saw the industry fail, the union lose its power and the jobs ultimately disappear.  It was a slow, painful decline that had a devastating effect on the community.

I love The Wire. But I love The Wire even more because they took the time and effort to tell this story. Warts and all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was one of my favourite shows of all time. Although the last few seasons weren't that great the rest of it was so exceptional that I'll always include it in my top 5 list.

I'm disappointed it's rarely discussed anymore and unlike other popular shows (e.g, The Wire and The West Wing) that have gone off the air it doesn't have a subreddit of its own.

Thanks for posting this clip. </TEXT>

True.  But she has stated, Colbert was the last time I saw it, where she doesn't want to work with kids on set.  

Here's a link to the interview:

https://youtu.be/UQ6-uVGEDxU

I think she meant that she doesn't want her character to have a baby with Leonard and not necessarily with respect to Howard and Bernadette's child.

In the context of the interview it could be interpreted that she's making a bit of a joke as a play on an earlier part where she discusses being "outspoken" in real life. She also jokes that she doesn't want to work with puppies. 

I could see this part of the interview being interpreted as a bit of a fluff piece designed to create some comedic banter. I do know that talk show hosts pre-interview their guests in order to ensure they have something funny or interesting to discuss. I'm guessing this was a set-up.

I wouldn't read too much into it.

	<TEXT> Pamela Adlon, a voice actress among other things and a long time friend of Carol Ann Susi, who played Mrs. Wolowitz does the voice of baby Halley. It is meant as a tribute.

http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-bang-theory-unexpected-way-howard-bernadettes-baby-honors-carol-ann-susi-955549

Quoted from showrunner Steve Molaro in reference to Adlon doing the voice:

"She is with us for the long haul, as far as I'm concerned. Any time we need Halley in the background, we will be calling on Pam. She's terrific, I'm a fan of all her work"

Edit: spelling mistake. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Such an extraordinary talent, mostly revered by other performers for her songwriting skills rather than the general public for her performing. Her original rendition of "Wedding Bell Blues", which she wrote really shows her off her vocal abilities. 

I watched her being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Bette Midler providing the introduction. Too bad the crowd had no clue who Laura was and spent most of the presentation speaking to each other instead of listening to the speech. </TEXT>

Call me crazy, but did anyone else feel a Trump-esque connotation?

The production schedule would indicate otherwise ("Production of the first 10 episodes of the first season took three years between 2014 and 2016", Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Pope). 

This would likely mean the scripts were likely written in 2014 so the timeline is off as Trump didn't declare his candidacy until June of 2015. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion Lenny would never get elected Pope. At least not in this era. There are too many older (and old fashioned) cronies running the Vatican right now. And it's a self perpetuating cycle. Only the most conservative, ambitious, hard working priests move up the chain to Bishop, Cardinal, etc. and/or get assigned to the Vatican. Most of these are also likely to very politically savvy and power hungry. I do know brilliant scholar-type priests often get assigned to the Vatican though, if only for a few years.

I think the Catholic Church runs like a Fortune 500 company except it doesn't have to answer to its shareholders as in the people who practise Catholicism. If someone like Lenny would to be elected Pope despite all the balances and checks along the way he would likely have a number of others in collusion with him and his agenda, which I would assume to be a radical reform of the Church. I don't see them wanting some form of a reality series documenting this process no matter how progressive their views. 

Edit to add: It would depend on who is making the television show. If it's outside forces I think they'd ignore it like they have with so many other film depictions (e.g., The Exorcist, The Last Temptation of Christ, etc.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't recall that it has ever explicitly been stated. 

I always assumed that when her husband was alive she was financially supported by him as a stay at home wife/mother (aside from the fact that she had agoraphobia and couldn't leave the home). Or it is possible that she was receiving disability benefits from a job that she had before she became agoraphobic.

When her husband died I assumed there was a life insurance settlement. He did have a good job probably with decent benefits as they had a nice house and seemed to always have enough money.

There's a great book about this called "Breakthrough." 

Another good book is "Banting: A Biography" by Michael Bliss (https://www.amazon.com/Banting-Biography-Michael-Bliss/dp/0802073867) and "The Discovery of Insulin: Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition" also by Bliss (https://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Insulin-Twenty-fifth-Anniversary/dp/0226058999/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)

The Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto where the discovery was made once had an exhibit of Banting's artifacts. Included were lab notes, instruments, photographs and the telegram announcing they had won the Nobel. It was very moving to see this in person.

I want to see a movie about this. I'm just picturing this scene right now and it makes me teary-eyed.

See "Glory Enough for All": http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157704/.

If I recall correctly there is a scene like this. I know for sure the film follows one young girl suffering from diabetes and they show Banting injecting her with insulin. She may have been the first patient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was able to watch the first season on Apple TV (in Canada). It was also carried by Super Station, a Canadian cable channel at the same time. According to their web site it doesn't appear as though they'll be carrying season 2 so I'm hoping it will show up here on Apple.

Edit to add: I'm afraid the show has lost a huge amount of momentum by releasing season 2 two years after season 1 was aired in January of 2015.

Edit # 2: I meant "Super Channel" not "Super Station". I searched online and in 2015 Super Channel (via the cable company Rogers) released details about airing season 1 only ten in advance of the premiere so there's hope they still might carry it.

	<TEXT> I thought this was a very interesting episode as it revealed how physicians, which we would normally associate as not being easily grossed out (med students excluded) were quite affected by the patient with this condition. In some instances their behaviour was actually unprofessional (Lexie, for example if I recall correctly). 

Perhaps this storyline was used to help humanize the physicians. Although on Grey's the viewer doesn't really need that since we know all about their weaknesses from the depiction of their private lives ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they should rename this show, "The Guilt". 

Noah feels guilty about whatever he did to his mother, Helen feels guilty about letting Noah take the fall for her with respect to the driving accident, Alison feels guilty about the death of her child and (I think) Cole feels guilty about not being able to help his brother with his substance use issues. 

Some of the characters may feel guilt over more than one thing. I think Noah and Alison both feel guilty about the beginning of their relationship given that they both were married. I'm not sure if Helen feels guilty about her children, specifically how they are being raised (neglected?) right now or maybe she feels guilty about the wealthy background she comes from. Or is she too self absorbed to notice these things? Im pretty sure she hired the lawyer to help Noah out of guilt. I'm sure there are more examples...

I think these feelings are really driving the characters' behaviour.
