	<TEXT> I play on All-star simulation with 8 minute quarters. I'm a 6'11 C who's averaging 5 rebounds a game. Sometimes it seems both my team and the opponent make every single shot, whether open or not.

Does upgrading defensive and offensive awareness help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because whenever anyone tried to play a game it would say the servers are down when it wasn't the case for other tournaments. AND it made you lose contracts. I tried my first time. I didn't even get to the loading screen and I got hit with the server message. I thought it was just being buggy so I retried and lost another set of them, without even playing the game.

That would be a pretty good guess as to why they removed it, to get things stabilized again. Some dudes on Operationsports lost 10 contracts. Kind of a fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me situation but losing 10 contracts I don't even understand why you wouldn't stop way before that. </TEXT>

I have a physics test tomorrow, for which we have had to do plenty of exercises for the past 3 weeks. Since this semester doesn't count, I am REALLY slacking. It's unbelievable.

I prefer staring at a wall. Please help me. Any time I start working on something, I get demotivated because I understand absolutely nothing. And reading the textbook does zero for me.

I'm screwed. I need advice. I wanna at least pass my classes. Even though they technically don't count, I would still have to retake them if I get a fail grade. </TEXT>

"Nah I can't this time."
"Why not?" (At this point I think less of the person, I shouldn't have to provide a reason)
"I have to be home ASAP, sorry."

And then they think of me as less of a friend for the next two days or however long it seems.

"Dude come to school earlier tomorrow morning; I hate sitting alone at a lunch table waiting for classes to start."
"Sorry man I need as much sleep as possible. No can do."
"Fuck off then."

If that "fuck off" is supposed to be interpreted as a joke, then it's a horrendous one. What the fuck.

Am I doing something wrong?

Bonus question: how do you refuse to lift someone if you feel like they take advantage of you?

I'm 18/male, not that it matters. I just feel the need to mention it every time I post something here.

Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was fine for about two hours when we returned from the vet. After waking up from a nap, he cries at every slight movement (he got vaccinated on his back).

The majority of the time, he'a not moving, just sleeping. But when he does move, he cried and barks a lit.

I read up on other forums. Apparently, it's normal behavior, but I'm worried. Should I take him to an emergency clinic?

Edit: He's awake now just sitting in a corner, but he's not willing to move. He's just staring at his surroundings.

Edit 2: Now we got guests over and he's jumping on them from excitement, crying at the same time from the pain. Should we place him in his crate? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-02-02 15:18:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In my first MyCareer, I was drafted 5th by the Suns. We traded every one of our good ayers: Dragic, Bledsoe, Gerald Green, Channing Frye, Shannon Brown.

What we got in return were David West, Taj Gibson, Andre Miller and some picks.

I'm a few games away from the playoffs, but it's so boring playing games where I'm the only guy on my team who shoots jumpshots. No one else shoots. I tried playing a Rookie casual game and I could only get 5 assists. I'm a pass first PG who plays 41 minutes. We're running Gibson at the 3 for crying out loud.

I made a new MyCareer where I went to the Pistons at 8th. Right now, I'm 20 games in. We haven't made any trades so far. What can I do to keep my team the way it is? </TEXT>

Then just spam A. Press conference? Spam A. When the scout talks to you, select "Scout always handle" and he won't bother you anymore. When the coach comes to discuss a strategy for an upcoming games (will happen 2-3 times), do whatever. Go through the season and through the playoffs, this will get you 1550 VC. Then, the owner will ask you to release Karl Malone, that will get you 100 VC.

When you're done, wait 6-7 minutes before you redo, or else you won't get the VC. Also, quit the game and restart it to get the same goals, and in turn to get the same amount of VC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I do find it pathetic that you need VC to do simple things such as changing your lineup, I use the VC farming method to get around it. I get 1650 VC every 5 minutes for mindlessly spamming A (Xbox One).

Are you on Xbox One or PS4? I can tell you how to do it. I've saved up about 70K VC doing this. No way in hell I'm gonna pay real money for fake money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a friend. He's 18, soon 19, like me. He has been depressed for a long time now. I will make this short.

He had a girlfriend who he wanted to break up with. When he did (in person IIRC) she threatened suicide. Well, him feeling guilty, they got back together. He was still never happy with her. I advised him to break up because I knew she's never go through with suicide.

He did, got another girlfriend, got dumped by her. Started texting me endlessly saying he wants to kill himself because he now has nothing in his life. I was hanging out with him at the time, so we saw each other often.

He got back together with his older girlfriend, the one who wanted to kill herself.

So the school semester starts. We have no classes together so we just gradually lost contact over time. I didn't hear much from him.

Fast forward to recently, ANOTHER semester starts, out last one.  Started Monday last week. After not seeing him at all for the first week at school, I texted him because I was worried.

He is now on medication, getting treated for severe depression and ADHD. He got "temporarily dumped" by his girlfriend (the suicide one) because his sadness is destroying the time they spend together. His family "hates" him even more than they used to apparently because he's sadder than ever and he's a drag. They've never really supported him well emotionally from what I've heard. He used to be suicidal; I don't know if he is now, but I'm worried.

Help. What can I say over a text message that can make him feel better? He constantly puts himself down, I try to lift him up, but he refuses anything I say. Understandably of course, depression does that to people.

Thank you in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahahah I wouldn't know how to photoshop a friend's face on a pornstar's body anyway. And if their photos ever don't do the trick, I got lots of videos of actual look alike pornstars. They're great for backup.

Also, I believe your story, but I refuse to believe anyone is naive enough to think a virus can do such thing. </TEXT>
