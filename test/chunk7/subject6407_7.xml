	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So in advance, I apologize for the very long post; I feel that every detail that I share is necessary for you guys to understand my situation more clearly. I am a 20-year-old male from the California that goes to a community college and lives with my parents. I feel like I'm a screw-up who has high hopes for a lot of things, but they end up getting crushed by reality. There are a lot of factors that play into this constant disappointment and dissatisfaction with life, but mainly it's because of me. I do feel like I have what it takes to change the world, but most of the time I end up acting very stupid. I have horrible social skills, bad attention span, lack of total common sense or logic, and so many other underlying issues within me that make me hate myself. I've thought of suicide a lot of times ever since I was younger when I used to be bullied for my thinking issues, and I try to ease these thoughts by assuring myself it doesn't lead anywhere and that I have a family that I love and need to take care of, but at the same time my life is so bleak when I sit and think about it. I would consider therapy and treatment (like for ADHD, Aspergers, anything...) here and there, but I'm not confident in making that decision, solely because of price, and I don't want my parents thinking I'm using a copout for my problems.

I think the external factor that plays in my sadness, is my father and my girlfriend, who are both VERY judgemental and condescending when it comes to my debacles and tumbles recently. My dad has always had set expectations so high for me it stresses me out, and every other day he points out something that I'm not doing right (e.g, not paying my own bills, not being financially stable, not being a 4.0 student with a good job, not cleaning the house), there's almost NEVER anytime he says that he's proud of me or positively pushes me towards anything. I'll try to do something that I feel is a good deed that he will notice, but there he goes pointing out something that I didn't do. As much as I understand he wants me to be a man, and that I know he wants the best for me and I love him, he's just so bitter for me, I know deep inside he thinks I'm a loser. Overtime, this has led me to make risky decisions and fabricate my grades, and lie to him about a lot of stuff. We've grown apart so much since my childhood, and everytime we are in the same house together I want to get out. It's just too much, and I'm too scared to even admit this to him because he will definitely take it the wrong way. I have also refrained from talking to other members of my family, for they don't know what problems I'm facing, I'm afraid word will eventually reach my father. My girlfriend is on the same boat, she loves me and cares for me, but she has called me "idiot, dumbass, retard" and a lot of other things in that nature. To the point I get yelled at for not doing things right.

I don't know, all I'm trying to say is, all my happiness and motivation is thinning to nothing. What if I am not the person I believe I am? What if I never get my life together. I don't know what's the next step to becoming an ordinary person that is independent and mentally capable of taking on life's challenges. I read motivational books and do brain training, and try everyhting I can think of to be a better person, but at the end of the day I'm the same person that can barely think for himself, is gullible, easily manipulated, and not able to be bold and prove everyone wrong.

	<TITLE> [College-Level Political Science] I need help finding good web sources for an essay? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-02 22:06:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, so I'm doing this political science essay and my professor has given little to no help on clarifying any good sources, he only wants web sources too, which makes it hard. It is about the constitution in relation to a presidents power. Here is the prompt.
*2. What are the main powers (expressed powers) granted the president directly by the Constitution? What are inherent powers? What are some of his delegated (statutory) powers? What are some examples of duties/powers assumed by the president in more recent times? (Think FDR and the president as Chief legislator.) How and why has the power of the President increased over time, while that of the party (Democratic or Republican) has lessened in the past few decades, and has this led to greater presidential independence? (Think campaign finance/bribery, and the change over time in its sources.) Please provide examples of this power shift. (Note that I am not asking you here primarily about the president's roles, but rather the powers which allow him to carry out those roles. If you cannot understand the difference, this might not be the right question for you.)*


The issue is we havent really gone over this topic much so I have little to know knowledge what to search for, so any comprehensive or trusted source will suffice. Beyond that I'll take on writing the essay by myself and dont really need help with writing it. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was this one time my friends and I during high school went to watch a movie on a no school weekday. We got our tickets and ran into the biggest douche I've seen in my life. I don't know what ticked him off, it probably was the possibility we looked under 18 to watch an R-rated movie. But my friend was just looking at the guy go back to his kiosk to confirm our id's and then this schmuck went ape shit walking towards us. 
"WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?"
"I didn't mean to stare at you, I'm sorry my friend..."
"FRIEND???? WHO ARE YOU CALLING FRIEND?"
"I'm sorry sir."
He threw us our tickets on the floor and said "go watch your movie" with the most condescending tone i've heard from a minimum wage employee. We decide to watch our movie and hide our anger. Once it finished, we came back out to talk to perhaps a manager to report the situation. And here is the movie theater fuckboy patrol chief pursuing us as we talk to another employee. He literally spotted us across the theater, stopped what he was doing, and went after us. 
"Whats the big deal over here?!"
We didn't want anymore business, we were like whatever we're leaving, didn't get to even tell the other employee what happened. My friend decided to flip him off on the way down an escalator. And HE STILL IS FOLLOWING US, LIKE WE'RE IN GANG TERRITORY. 
"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS DOING FLIPPING ME OFF? WHO DID THAT? YOUR MOVIE IS OVER, GO ON WITH YOUR LIVES."
Fuck it we never went back to that theater again. We called the customer service line for the theater and it turned out to be a manager interrogating us... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I have brilliantly formulated a new unit of measurement, what do you guys think? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-30 22:22:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So you guys know how the average dick is about 6 inches long (or half of a foot)? Well, how about we turn that in a unit to measure length? For example:

*John: Hey Bob how big is that screen in our office?
Bob: Hi John approximately it should be about 4 dicks long.*

*"It takes Julia about 10,560 dicks to finish her jog"*

If you have not noticed by now, there is way more precision in measuring with this unit. I honestly believe we can start integrating this into speedometers like dph for dicks per hour and soon enough for engineers. How do you guys feel about this?
