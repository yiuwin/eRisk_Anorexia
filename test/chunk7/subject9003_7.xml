	<TEXT> Well there is a case where shit learned on LSD is profound and actualized. If it weren't actualized, then what is learned is useless shit that a lot of acid users talk about. I don't think anyone should really talk about shit they learned. Just put it in to practice. A friend of mine said "those who say the least know the most". It isn't a universal maxim but an a posteori judgment. Some kantians would say you could derive a maxim that can be universalized and some would say other wise. It comes down to how you read into the first and third formulation of the Categorical Imperative. 

I don't know what I'm talking about. I like to talk about philosophy when I'm tipsy. Back to this paper </TEXT>

I am buying [this Chinese carbon frame.](http://www.velobuildmall.com/vb-r-055-super-light-carbon-fiber-road-bike-frame-set-830g/) (Let's not debate the quality of Chinese carbon itself.

	<TITLE> Building a road bike. In need of a decent guide. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-11 20:22:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've seen plenty of video series on building bikes, but I would really prefer a written up guide that lists necessary supplies/tools and also has pictures with each step. I've seen plenty of blog posts of people building up their bikes, but those are usually mere anecdotes. Thus, lacking substance.

I just ordered all the parts I think I need. Could someone at least look it over and say whether or not I've got everything.

-Carbon rame with internal cabling and BBright.

-Carbon seatpost and clamp

-BB right to BSA converter

-Headset

-Carbon clincher wheels with Shimano hub

-Ultegra 11sp Groupo with an english BB (is that the same as BSA? will it fit?) and braze on FD (I'm pretty sure the frame can do a brazed FD)

-"Complete Cable Kit"

-11cm Stem 31.8 clamp

-Handlebars 31.8

-Pedals, saddle, bartape, tires, tubes,

-Carbon Fiber paste and park tools grease

-I'm going to be building the bike the school bike shop. They probably have all the tools necessary but I am unsure about a BB tool. Is there a specific tool for english threaded BBs?


Thanks for reading and potentially helping! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm guessing you aren't doing any racing, if that anything more than a Cat 5 or 4. Carbon bikes are much more comfortable than aluminum and steel frames. A race bike's geometry may be uncomfortable for those lacking in flexibility but even your grandma would find the average your bike comfortable. As for gears, most bikes are double crank 11 or 10 speeds. If by speed, you mean number of possible gears (meaning my 11 speed is your 22 speed, then you are either spinning out at 30 mph or spinning 40 rpm up 4% grades. 

Racing or just riding competitively strongly favors newer carbon bikes (there are a few exceptions, such as the CAAD 10). Chris Froome would smoke me on your bike, that doesn't mean that I should buy your old Bianchi </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Contador is more of a time trialist than a climber. Also that ratio is just dumb. An accurate measure is your power to weight ration. A sprinter or time trial rider will want a butt load of power with little regard for their weight (obviously they don't want to be a 250 lb power lifter). A climber wants to have as much power per pound of body weight as possible. Some people, like Armstrong, can be bigger and maintain a high power to weight ration (obviously drugs were involved). Marco Pantani went with a smaller frame and that's what worked for him.

A few other things to consider with climbers is that they have a lot of slow twitch fibers. They can attack on a climb, go extremely anaerobic, and recover quickly. Also a higher blood lactate level will allow them to climb harder longer. A high VO2 max allows a climber to work more efficiently. It should be noted that VO2 and blood lactate are important for all parts of cycling. 

Having an abundance of slow twitch fibers and a high power to weight ratio is what makes someone a good climber, not some silly height-weight ratio. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a lot of fun in the fresh snow and inconsistent on packed snow. It isn't actually my bike. I checked it out over my winter break from a school program, Outdoor Pursuits. 

I've been doing a lot of climbing in the San Juan mountains. The day it snows, about six inches to a foot, the bike is awesome! The day after when cows, horses, hikers, and sun get to the trails/roads, the bike is awful. Today I was riding around some River beds up into canyons in northern New Mexico. There was about three inches of snow. It was sitting in the sun for two days but the bike killed it! 

Deep snow is best dry. Luckily I live in the desert where snow is always super dry. When the sun hits it and it gets packed, it's miserable, unless it's not too deep or packed.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Inscurance Claims </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-17 01:55:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I would like some insight about filing an insurance claim for a totaled bike. But first, the accident

About a month ago I was hit by a driver. I was going down a hill. The driver was at a stop, waiting to turn left. When I was about twenty meters (I'm not great with distance, but a distance to close for me to avoid him) away, he decided to turn. Strava says I was going anywhere from 17 to 22 mph. I flipped over the car. The driver called 911. An officer showed up and started a police report. An ambulance showed up and I was off to the critical care unit with my bike.


They took a couple of cat scans and verified that I had a skull fracture. They wanted to keep me overnight in the event that I have any complications. I get out of the hospital about the next night.

I noticed when I got out that my wheels were not spinning. I looked at the bike and saw a couple of things that were wrong. The frame was cracked (Carbon), wheels were bent (alloy), handlebars bent (alloy), derailleur was bent, and few other little things. The bike is a 2008 trek Pilot 5.0 so I took it to my lbs that deals trek. They guy in there is very knowledgeable. He raced "proffesionally" on Treks for years and has been selling them even longer. Luckily he was experienced with insurance write ups.


He set the price for 2015 Trek with similar components. That number ended up being around $2,800. I just got the police report yesterday with all the information from the accident. His auto insurance is State Farm


**What I'm asking for is some insight into the process of filing a claim for a bike. For any of you who have had experience with these types of things, what things would you recommend I do and not do?** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yall have some cognitive dissonance. Eating meat is bad, yes. Eating animal products is bad, yes. Going vegan is a good ethical decision (I can argue how it is good from every position, so please do press me on it. I am studying philosophy with a concentration in ethics). Why should you be upset if someone is doing something good? I do not have any reason to care if you eat meat or not. Western culture does not have a vegetarian or vegan consensus. It would be appropriative for me to shit on you for eating meat. That being said, I am always delighted whenever someone tries to do something good, such as going vegetarian or vegan. I am just as delighted about that good act than someone who decides to work at the soup kitchen.

We are making an effort to be good. What about trying to do something good is upsetting to you? This is a genuine question. I want to foster a good debate </TEXT>

Your feet dry quickly and you developers a tolerance for the cold. I wear skate shoes for everything, even if I'm romping through the snow. The key to fighting the cold is to not give a shit.
