	<TEXT> The Human Condition by Hannah Arendt

Basically she talks about the three forms of human activity - Labor, Work and Action. She criticizes Marx for not differentiating Labor from Work. For her, Labor is about fulfilling the biological needs of the body (animal laborans) while work involves fabrication and changing the material reality (homo faber). Both are incomplete forms of human activity because they are both driven by necessity. Action which is similar to speech involves participation in the shared world. Through this participation we can exist in our specificity and uniqueness and engage others in a dialogue for the betterment of our shared world.

The German Ideology by Karl Marx

Its a good summary of Marxist thought. He criticizes his old group of friends (Young Hegelians) for being disillusioned idealists and do not realize that everything is due to the material forces. From this idea, he goes on discussion the origins of private property and the division of labor.

Time and the Other by Emmanuel Levinas (Chapter on Eros)

He talks about the pathos of love and how it involves an encounter with the "other". For him loves involves the protection of the duality of beings of the lovers. He also analyzes the phenomenology of sex. Its not something I can explain in a few short sentences.

Totality and Infinity by Emmanuel Levinas (Chapter on the Phenomenology of Eros)

This is sequel to what he wrote in the first book but he changes his understanding of eros. In the first book he talks about the duality of beings, in this books he realized that there is a difference in those beings.  
Levinas is a complicated read, I don't think I explained it well :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it has something to do with the design and characteristics of our society that discourages the development of those kinds of intellectuals. First of all, we have a very anti-intellectual culture and at a young age, children learn that being "pilosopo" is a bad thing. Second, our educational system suffers from a lack of quality and it has a bias towards skills that are more employable. Third, the prevalence of Christian teachings has numbed and turned most of the population apathetic and more accepting of their hardship. There are other cultural factors that contributes to this but Christian teachings are definitely one of the main contributors. Occasionally we do have exceptions like Rizal, but these individuals were either insulated or spared from these conditions. Rizal had a very miserable life growing up and he sought education to improve it. He was also a victim of Spanish injustice, and its possible that some of the hatred of his brother towards the spaniards was passed on to him. His brother suddenly couldn't go to school because of the cavite mutiny, and he was made to watch the execution. We also know that Rizal questioned religion and the moral virtues it imposes </TEXT>
