	<TEXT> No. I have found no one cause for my eating disorder, but a bunch of factors played a role. 

I am sorry to hear that you've experienced this. I was raped when I was 16, so I can understand how hard it must be for you, in some senses. I would really encourage you to see a therapist and/or dietitian to begin healing from your trauma and being to build better coping mechanisms. (DBT and CBT are great) 

Don't let these experiences define you and your future. Reach out for support, there are loads of resources!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great! I'm in school to become a registered dietitian specialized in eating disorders which helps give me a sense of purpose.

How are you? :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was 13 when I first developed my eating disorder and coexisting mental health issues. So yes, it began initially before the trauma, hah. 

I've racked my brain through therapy for years trying to determine the "cause," and nothing has ever come of it. I had a splendid childhood with not many issues. I've always been a perfectionist (which stemmed from years of gymnastics), so I feel that had a lot to do with the development. There are so many things that went into it tbh haha. 

I didn't really have an "aha" moment/turning point, but I was supposed to go to college right after I graduated high school. I had paid for some stuff and had a roommate and everything. But then my weight dropped to a critical point and I got sent away again to treatment. After that, I was sorta like "I need to get my shit together, I want to go to college, there's so much more out there for me" </TEXT>
