	<TEXT> Like a dude above said, connect it to an external monitor first to rule out motherboard issues. Then I suggest you replace the wire, it might be an issue of the LCD connector, that's a lot more likely to go faulty than the screen itself. 

And you're right, it's not a very tough job to do yourself BUT if time is an issue, go your city's IT marketplace or whatever, and have a guy do it for you. Tell them to replace the wire only, though. It's a one day job for them, two at best. So don't panic, it's no biggie :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first flaw that pops into my head is easily the visual aesthetic of the movies. I find that a vast majority (and I'm explicitly looking at Marvel movies here) tend to be....bland. Like the Avengers, for instance. Name one scene that you could consider creative in its cinematography and visual setting. All the Cap movies suffer from this too. The plot may be interesting but the setting itself is usually bland and boring. Large and extravagant, sure. But bland. 

The second flaw would be what I call "character" in a movie. I'll bring up the example of my favourite superhero movie Spider-Man 2. The movie has so much character, that feels intrinsic to the movie itself. It's a result of the movie being a little eccentric, little quirky scenes like the "Raindrops are falling on my head" scene or the jazzy transitions. The superhero movies I see now feel mechanical and formulaic to me, and nothing really stands out. I think the blame lies with the studios, not the filmmakers themselves.

Like the great Vincent Chase said, 
They don't care about art, all they care about is munnneyyy </TEXT>
