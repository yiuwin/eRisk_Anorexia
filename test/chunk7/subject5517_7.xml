In addition to just not wanting to, I have some issues that can be genetic that I wouldn't want to hand down. And even I did want kids, it would be terrible of me to have any. I am irresponsible, lazy, and impatient. I would be a horrible mother. And quite frankly, I'm vain. I don't want stretch marks and mom boobs. There's nothing wrong those things, they are just not for me. Finally I am horrified of gaining weight and I don't like large amounts of pain and because of past sexual abuse I wouldn't be able to handle the prenatal checkups and doctors or nurses poking around at me during labor. Also because of that past I would be terrified to touch the child in anyway and if it was female I would never be able to bond with it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats awful. I'm so so sorry. just because there are people so diluted as to think that one's gender can't be raped, or that one's gender means they can't commit rape, doesn't mean it wasn't. I kind of have a similar experience from quite some time ago, where if the gender had been different it would have been taken seriously. I was sexually assaulted by a female psychiatrist (I'm a female myself though so it's a bit easier, I just have to avoid gender pronouns for the monster when talking about it) and I *know* that if the psychiatrist had been a man, I could have had him charged and arrested no problem- vulnerable 14 year old girl in a mental hospital held down and stripped and groped by *male* psychiatrist? That would have been so easy to prosecute and many more people would have believed me and supported me. But a vulnerable 14 year old girl in a mental hospital held down and stripped and groped by a *female* psychiatrist? "you must be remembering things wrong", "you're lying", "it must have been procedure", etc. 

I wish everyone would accept that gender has nothing to do with rape or molestation or anything like that. Men can be victims too. Women can be monsters too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciate the sharing of your experience. And you've put the reasons into words better than I ever could. Thank you. It is so disgusting that this happens and is ignored or laughed at. I can't stand how so many people don't care about male abuse victims.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was an anorexic 14 year old trying to keep weight off while still appearing to be "recovering" to my family to avoid being sent back to the treatment center so I decided to buy some laxatives. I had a very intense binge of roughly 17,000 calories and then took a few laxatives. After writhing in pain all night from the cramping I bolted to bathroom almost exactly 12 hours after taking them and the result was a huge *pile* of shit. It filled the bowl up to the waterline at the highest point. My waist was 4 inches smaller than the night before. I was so *satisfied*.  </TEXT>

I'm a woman though, and that's why *I* oppose feminists.  </TEXT>
