	<TEXT> "stop smoking weed," said the man holding his bourbon glass. 

The fact is drug testing is pretty dumb, all because someone smokes weed, doesn't mean that they are irresponsible and are going to be smoking on the job or going into work high. I drink, doesn't mean i drink on the job or go to work drunk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So as someone who didn't watch a lot of the lions as a kid growing up, and only sees Barry on highlight films, honest question:

I know he was one of the best ever, but did he get tackled for loss a loss a lot? i know he had huge plays all the time, and he broke tackles like no other, but it seems like his playing style (ei: often reversing field behind the line of scrimmage) would get punished alot too, I mean when they work, they're amazing (thus highlight reels) but when he'd get stopped seems like it'd be for pretty big losses... I guess i'm asking if he's kinda like Brett Farve (in his prime), amazing when hes good, while at the risk of losing big yards when hes not.  </TEXT>

I think you posted this before and I didn't really read the figure, i was thinking it was more abstract/ the shoulder was a weird head thing. personally i think you need to work on distinguishing between the layers, maybe if you made the white outlines slightly more pronounced, or changed you carving weight between layers that might help to get things a bit more dimensional  </TEXT>

ps. but honestly, unless your someone famous who wants to remain anonymous , i don't think its a issue to post something with your last name. The idea that you have to be 100% detached from you personal identity when posting to reddit... especially when posting OC in an artistic forum is silly, imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this is really well done and a technical beast, but i think you should push yourself to make slightly more original work. prints/reproductions of pictures like this often feel more akin to a photoshop filters than to original images. not to say that you didn't hand craft the image, but personally i don't feel like you've added your own voice to the piece. you clearly have a technical ability that is killer, you just need to keep going with it.  </TEXT>

-What you'll need 3 blocks that are the same size, 
-registration sheet
-paper

step 1) carve black block
step 2) make registration sheet for black block, and print
step 3) remove black block and replace with new blank block, re-register previously printed block onto the new block, (make sure registration is tight) and run thru the press -the wet print will offset onto the blank block,
step 4) repeat with another block, 
step 5) carve out color blocks
step 6) print color block, let dry, print 2nd color block, let dry, print black block, and your done

	<TEXT> Herd to tell entirely what's going on, but it looks like your ink might be too think (which would slow drying) so my first suggestion would be to tone that down. 

Something else you could do is to throw some (just a schmidge) cobalt drier into your ink with will quicken your drying times (it's toxic so wear gloves) 

also I've found the thinner the fabric the quicker it dries, when I printed on muslin it dried basically overnight, when I printed on a Tshirt it took like 3-4 weeks to dry (dunno why the disparity, but haven't investigated it too much.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only problem I had at first was getting the thumbnail to show up right, because it's always the first picture you upload, even if you change the order later on. Also if the image size is to big it might not show a thumbnail.... And if you don't have a thumbnail the odds of your post getting traction go down. 

Also it's not that artist websites are particularly difficult to navigate, it's just they are each different, often take SLIGHTLY longer to load/navigate, which In the internet age can mean the difference between hitting the back button or spending a minute looking at your work. I've had a picture ripped off imgur and rehosted before, but whatever, if people want to steal your stuff their going to do it, just like music/software, pirates gonna pirate.   </TEXT>

Also I'm mostly a mobile user so it's easier for me to flick thru your pics on imgur rather than hope that your site is easy to go thru on an iPhone. Do I really care about self promotion, due to website vs imgur... Nah it's all an ease of use kinda thing. if I like what you show, and I want to see more then I'll put up with navigating your site.  </TEXT>

And yah they want to tear it down, and use the space, instead of paying taxes on a "worthless" lot, wouldn't you do the same thing?

it'd be like if you had a broken down POS el camino in your driveway, and wanted to get rid of it so you could park your car you actually drive there. But your neighbors demand you save the el camino, and put in far more money into it than the car is even worth. And in the end you have an el camino, that has to much money spent on it, and your still parking your new car in the road.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, and Sorry op didn't mean to sound like a dick, just feel like in a lot of cases (can't speak about you particularly since I really can't see the photo too well) the artist spends 90% of the time on the face, and the suit is just quickly done without the same amount of detail and attention because the face is the money maker, and the suit is just secondary or tertiary. I like when the same amount of care that goes into the face goes those secondary items, expecially when they amount for 90% of the picture frame. But a that said, good job, super cool experience.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this maybe semi trivial, but pinning thru your prints makes me cringe, When you pin them to the wall use the flat part that faces the wall to hold it against the wall, you don't need to stab your actual prints to get them to stay up there. 

Edit: also I like the background forms but think they might be slightly over powering , I feel like in this image you want the figure to be the foreground, but him being light kinda makes him secendary. I'd like to see him a bit darker, and some more subtle/ grey tones being used for the outside marks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally I think this is a great question, and one that's extremely hard to answer simply. 

One of the hardest things an artist can do (IMO) is create a unique style. It's hard, it takes a long time and much trial and error. Although some artist you look at May have styles that seem very simple and minimal, they've often taken years upon years to refine. It's not something you can just ok my style will be "X" and it'll be good. It's more of a seeing where your work takes you and embracing/ pushing that. 
Until little over half way thru undergrad I stuggled to find "my style" most of my work took on the form of the assignments I was assigned, and looked like "student work" it was fairly boring and generic. I always envied those around me that had their thing, their style, their nuances. I wondered why I hadnt found mine, would I ever find mind?
I think I found my "style" one semester then I was taking a semester break from art school, when I stopped having to make assignments, where I stopped making work for my teachers, and made a piece that was for me, and only me, no one else would need to see it, just me. That was MY point where my style started to define itself, when I started to do what I wanted and didn't care what anyone else said. When I embraced what I liked, and made that I like. Granted that point had been slowly building for 5+ years, and has slowly evolved since then. 
Looking back at my "student work" I could see threads of what lead to my style, I saw how my work was a progression that lead me where I wanted to get to. So I think all I'm really trying to say is keep pushing, keep working, keep looking for those threads, and eventually you'll find yourself. GL </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh Geeze your doing 100 days, GL it gets hard after awhile. I did one print a day for 6 months and it was a bitch staying with it. I ended up making each month themed, otherwise I started running outa things to carve. 

Also try to work on getting your prints cleaner, those smudges need to go. Wash you hands if they get inky. When I'm printing I try to pick up my plates with my ring finger and pinky, the use your other 3 fingers to pick up your paper. That way it minimized the chance of ink getting on your prints.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If your just talking about multi block printing, don't really have a demo... I'll make one next time, but it's really pretty simple, though describing it takes a minute. 

1) Get 2 blocks (or more) that are  same size. 2) carve your key block (the black one in my case). 3) make a registration sheet just like you would for any other relief print. 4) ink up, register, and print your key block. 5) take out your key block and replace it with the 2nd blank block. 6) put the inked up print back onto of the new block ( making sure the registration is the same) 7) run it back thru the press. 8) you now have the key block transferred exactly onto your 2nd block. Carve it up, print it, then print your key block on top of that, just make sure your registration is the same every time and you'll be multi block printing in no time </TEXT>

Although sometimes it's nice, I the actual printing process is one of my least favourite parts, and is more of a chore that's part of getting to my end goal, the prints. if I could, I'd have assistants do all my printing for me, but I don't, So using a vandercook to speed the process that I don't like, and let me get back to the part I enjoy more....

	<TEXT> I'm not going to argue the validity of the mural but a couple points... A) the last thing we need is more horse/ bourbon art. B) the building is privately owned and the mural was privately funded, its more akin your nieghbor having an "monstrosity" of a house which annoys you rather than them vandelizing your fence. C) Its not like the nursery was in the middle of a sublime pasture encased in rolling hills, its in the middle of a dilapidated industrial district flanked by train tracks and abandoned warehouses. (honestly i feel like the nursery is more out of place than the mural is, but thats just an opinion) D) "art should stay in a museum" what you fail to realize is that meuseum art is highly curated/ often highly pretencious/ and thus often highly institutionalized (ei only what the meuseum wants to be "art" is "art") which creates a huge barrier for any artist who isn't dead. Graffiti gives an artist a canvas which can still reach an audience without having to edit himself to fit within the bounties which are acceptable by institutional standards.
