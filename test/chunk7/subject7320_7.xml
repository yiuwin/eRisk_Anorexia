	<TEXT> You can get the whole thing on marvel unlimited and in order too.  Just be prepared for an insane amount of pointless filler.  It wasn't the best story line and the end solves nothing and feels pretty hollow.  Play marvel ultimate alliance instead if you can.  Better than reading one more comic about speedball (an awful superhero that civil war focuses pretty heavily on for really no reason)

	<TEXT> You can find crazy stats like that on any game.  It just means people turned on the game and for whatever reason decided it wasn't for them.  

Clunky controls are a pretty big turn off.  My immediate reaction when I started it up was like "ugh people are confusing poor design and controls with difficulty".  But I went back a month later and it turned out to be really fun.  

It is difficult, but the majority of the userbase greatly exaggerates it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's hard comparitively.  If someone had never played a game on a system before xbox 360 or ps3 then this game would appear pretty uniquely hard.  

These games are fun, but skill is not required.  You can get a similar experience from most rpgs by simply setting the difficulty all the way up, and then it is series of remembering a pretty basic sequence of button mashing until the end.

Loved the game, just hate when people go on like they are in some elite club because they beat a dungeon grinder. </TEXT>

It has a relatitvely low user base, yet somehow it got upvoted on to the front page.  Not only that, but 20 something people scrolled to the bottom of this post and downvoted my comments.  20 something people sought a buried comment that would have required a bit of clicking to get to.  I can not even find my comment when I go to look for it.  You can be damn sure I reported this whole fucking thing for vote manipulation.

	<TEXT> This is simply not true and you guys should be ashamed of yourselves.  I get my news from npr which at least Reddit agrees is a legit news source.   There it is nothing positive I can find on this.  This is a product marketed towards teens by people who are trying to fill the void that the shrinking tobacco industry has made.  You guys can down vote all you like.  I've never seen people have such a hard on for something that isn't fda approved.  You realize that is just as stupid as defending bullshit supplements from gnc.  10 years from now people going to be like "wow I rabidly defended something I knew nothing about and it turned out it was pretty unsafe.

Talk to a doctor.  These companies are not some benevolent group.  They want you to keep using it while funneling it through a questionable medium.

	<TEXT> I jump in and out of comics over the years.  Most recently I reread Onslaught (one of my favorites as a teen, I know it's not the best but I have fond memories of it) and am currently rereading Civil War.  I'm looking for anything not on MCU as I will be reading those here and there.  I just want to get a good collection to read on toilet at home or something.  I'd like it to be more current (I have tough time getting into older comics these days, but am not completely closed off)  Favorite characters are too many to list but i can probably limit it to Cable, Wolverine, Thanos, Adam Warlock, Iron Man.  I like big story arcs with an "oh shit everyone is going to die" theme and gritty reboots.   </TEXT>

Like seriously, how the fuck does Blame Canada win some bullshit award awhile back and the the guitar battle between Toki and Swisgard not immediatly not take that award away and then Blame Canada is all like "You're right, it was even that fucking clever" and then the guitar dual is like "That's ok, the bar is set pretty fucking low these days, I wouldn't sweat it" and then Blame Canada is all like "I appreciate you, guitar duel....like...seriously, thanks man.  It really means a lot"  and the guitar duel is all like "It's cool I've been drinking quite a bit and then posting to Reddit late at night" and then Blame Canada is all like "It's cool, not one is going to read this shit anyway" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some context is seriously missing from this story.   I mean I'm sure those guys are assholes, but this is like when that pastor was saying things like "he was on his way to church to preach the word of the Lord when he was gunned down".  The story didn't need extra bs to make it a tragedy, it already was one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the other side of the token, I have noticed that many intro level class professors take their class way more seriously.   "Guys I know no one is majoring in this area and the university is forcing you to take this bullshit, but i am dissatisfied with my life so I will be grading attendence, weekly quizzes, and so much homework that you would think even 10 percent of this will be in the test-it won't." </TEXT>
