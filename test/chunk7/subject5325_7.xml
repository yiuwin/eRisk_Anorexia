	<TEXT> - You need to add his works on the right like the work with SBTRKT, Dual and links to his iTunes, Play Music and Spotify (like you did with r/frankocean)
- He's not very active on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram but you should definitely have a place just for those links.
There's not much you can do otherwise tbh you just need to hope more people find his music and end up here. I would suggest daily song discussions but it's nowhere near big enough like Kanye's or Frank's for that.
Hopefully by the time Process the film is out, more people will know him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> HL Maths needs effort if you're not naturally quick at understanding maths like you need to be able to commit. You can't expect to put the same passive effort as you would in SL as this is a lot of commitment. But don't let me scare you. It's fantastic to have a slight head start if you study in the STEM field at university. </TEXT>
