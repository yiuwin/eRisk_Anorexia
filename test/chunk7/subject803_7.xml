	<TEXT> I remember trying to buy a netbook some 6-7 years ago when it was about $200-250 in the U.S., but in Korea it was about 650,000 or so.

Wow, is this 2016/17?

Does the government prevent buying products from overseas?

I wonder why they're so expensive....

	<TEXT> In 1996 I got a Slurpee in a 711 and overflowed it way over the rim as you do. My uncle told me this infuriated the clerk and we all got charged double.

That's a shame.

Once every few year in Australia, 7/11 runs a "BYO Cup Day" where they encourage people to bring whatever container (no matter how large) and fill it up for the same price as the usual size.

They use KFC buckets, rice cookers, pots for plants, garbage cans....it still cracks me up.

However, even though they're basically giving away slurpee, they get a **huge** amount of sales in their other products.

Which is why I don't understand that clerk's stance towards you.

That's because it is......


A few years ago, I had an idea for an app that could change how people interact with the internet on their mobiles.

However, since I was a Civ Eng student.....I just abandoned it.

However, I think running away is not the answer, so I have a few questions for the Developers/Programmers who frequent the sub;

1 - What programming language should someone learn to code a Android/iPhone app?

2 - How many hours/months/years of practise/study does a complete amateur need to be able to start working on said app?

3 - What myths/misunderstandings do you constantly see people have about programming/app building?

Thank you very much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cause most of them are in the same continuity

I get where you're coming from, but there's no rule saying a movie in the same continuity can't look visually different, especially with the animated movies....that are **very** loosely linked and are nowhere near the MCU/DCEU type of interconnected stories.

For example, other than Batman -  "JL: Throne of Atlantis" and "Batman: Bad Blood" aren't connected (but have the same artistic style).

The DC animated movies can be given more leeway for each director to have his/her own unique signature.

I don't think it would detract from the story. </TEXT>

I remember watching a live video last year, a few weeks before BvS's release.

He said the exact same thing.

It's not his fault, people who watch movies before everyone feel like they are a part of some exclusive club.....thus the great reviews/remarks movies get before release.

Hell, people who watched the Fantastic 4 reboot early loved it.

ALL characters are the Peter Parker with different powers

While this is your opinion, I have to disagree....

- Spiderman is not the same as a billionaire kidnapped by terrorists.

- Tony Stark is not the same as a World War 2 veteran given a super strength serum.

- Steve Rogers is not the same as an African King with mystical powers and cat-like agility.

- T'Challa is not the same as a wise cracking S.H.I.E.L.D operative who uses arrows as a main weapon.

- Clint Barton is not the same as a hammer wielding alien god with an evil adopted brother.

- Thor is not the same as a sentient synthetic being fused to one of the infinity gems.

- Vision is not the same as a decorated military officer who has used his billionaire friend's tech for good and is now paralysed.

- James Rhodes is not the same as a high school teenager bitten by a radioactive spider and harnesses his amazing strength and intellect.

Should I continue? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lex wanted to show that Superman was willing to take sides in conflicts. (Something the comics tell us he was avoiding).

It still baffles me that the amazing stories in the comics weren't used in the movie.

Man, I would give up my left testicle to see Superman using his powers in a smart and calculated manner...like the train sequence in the comics.

I can understand the thinking behind it but that didn't come across in the film so it felt pointless. There's lots of ways they could have salvaged it just by having someone mention what a unique event it was.

I would have greatly appreciated the African incident if it was given due importance. 

For the general audience (who weren't living in Metropolis for the past two years), an explanation for why this situation is important and unprecedented would have gone a **long** way in alleviating the confusion most had regarding Lex's plan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean Lex doesn't even bring Naoromi up once during his conversations with Finch. Why engineer that scenario if he wasn't even going to try and use it as leverage?

Exactly.

Furthermore, why does Lex feel an incident in Africa would resonate more than the BZ Event for the people of Metropolis/America?

People die every day in multiple foreign countries that are simply ignored daily, but the death of innocent people in western countries are given weeks of 24/7 coverage.

Using his pristine image as "The Saviour of Metropolis", Lex could have used his voice and contacts to absolutely berate Superman in the media.

People are still emotionally affected by 9/11, imagine an attack the size of ten 9/11's that occured only two years ago.

It's also kind of sad that they didn't show the damage the attack did to Metropolis. In the movie, Metropolis is spotless - as if a huge attack didn't occur.

There is little to no sign of skyscrapers being re-built, no allusion to the **huge** increase in the homeless population and even the increase in Black Market activity due to people scavenging Kryptonian parts from the scout ship (explored in the comics).

I think a story where Lois focused on her efforts to uncover the shadowy benefactor who he is character assassinating her boyfriend could've been really cool.

	<TEXT> The kind of man Bruce was, the kind of man Clark truly is. These are not concepts that require a whole movie to set up. And even if they'd had those solo movies you'd still need to set up those concepts in the BvS narrative for the drama based around them to be effective. I think that was Snyder's biggest mistake. Assuming that because everybody knows who these characters are that it would be a waste of time to set that backdrop for people to be engaged in the film.

I absolutely agree.

I don't personally think all the JL'ers needed solo movies.

I loved the concept of BvS, but I think Snyder's mistake was to add in a villain (Lex Luthor) when the movie could've easily been a Superman movie with Batman as a "villain".

Focusing on both sides and ending with a mutual agreement.

They really dropped the ball by focusing more on Africa and Doomsday, rather than the emotional crux of the DCEU....the BZ event and Batman's anger fuelling his fight for Supes.

The trailers and advertisements promising a different movie didn't help either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find the "gripes" in this article are great buzzwords, but takes away the real criticism people had for the movie.

For example, a lot of people did say that solo movies would've been better for the DCEU - but it was a response to BvS's extremely convoluted plot that gave us a Batman that "had fallen" while never truly seeing where he fell from (his character before the BZ Event), a Superman who didn't change character wise (from MoS) and was more a conduit for plot progression than his own unique character....... and a cameo of Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg which had little to do with the movie.

Obviously this is my opinion, but if they wanted to discuss the points people have against the movie - wouldn't it have been better if they dug deep rather than arguing an extremely shallow statement?

It would've been a great article. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is it when an article is supporting/against the DCEU, they use the most asinine and basic of criticisms as a counter argument to their opinions.

- "They Need More Jokes, Like The Marvel Movies!"

- "They Need Action Scenes That Aren't So Explosive!"

- "They Needed To Do Solo Character Films First!" [This one I've heard a lot and I find it a good gripe to discuss].



-  "They Need To Stop Taking Such Dumb Chances!"

- "They Need To Really UNDERSTAND The Characters!"

I really like Cracked, but if an article wants to discuss the pros or cons of the DCEU movies, they need to delve deeper and focus on what people are really saying...instead of using "clickbaity" arguments that only the most rabid fans use.

	<TEXT> Yes, but I'm talking from the perspective of a normal person who doesn't know about the existence of other dimensions or even magic.

Oh, then I agree.

However, the people in the Marvel universe have seen things we could only dream of....which is why her belief seems a tad comical.

	<TEXT> I think the reason why he looks weird is because all he has left is half a face.

The definition of a cyborg is;

*a fictional or hypothetical person whose physical abilities are extended beyond normal human limitations by mechanical elements built into the body.*

In the comics, Cyborg still looks human. You can see parts of his arm, the majority of his head and even a partial leg.

Cyborg in JL looks like a robot with half a human face, it doesn't feel all that natural......  the shape of his new body doesn't even look vaguely human.

The Cyborg in the comics could wear a suit and from the outside, his body would look similar to his Football days.

I like how he looks in the movie, I'm just explaining why some people might find it odd.

A question if you will.

It's an extremely common question, but as someone with dark skin....it's a question that has always intrigued me.

How does a Black/African/African-American male get treated in Japan, especially in the new age of globalisation?

Does it change when you are fluent in Japanese? </TEXT>

You literally proved my point.

I used the New 52 page because I think it's epic....and it's a fairly recent rendition - proving he didn't really need an "upgrade".

However, Aquaman has always been a badass character. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They don't have to do a full reboot.

Fox was able to do a semi reboot of their franchise with Days of Future Past.

The DCEU could use the Flash movie as a way to change whatever they need.

For example, Flash changes the timeline and Batman isn't a killer anymore and the Joker has no tattoos.

Ofcourse these are examples, but you could do anything with the premise.

Hell, you could establish an alternate earth and once the actors in this universe are too old...you could re cast them and create the "Earth 2 DCEU". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except his opinion is wrong, why would there be loads of colours in deep water? Deep water is meant to be dark.

It's Atlantis, a made up city underwater.

The soldiers could've had golden/green armour, the building they were in could've been an interesting colour as well.

While Atlantis is deep water, they also have access to magic and I'm pretty sure there's a source of light as well (faux sun).

I personally have no issues with the scene, but the scene *could* have been more colourful.

Atlantis is a place where you can go balls to the wall creative with amazing architecture, Lovecraftian monsters and weird fish.

PS - Opinions are never wrong when it comes to film/cinema. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two shots of Cyborg were pretty bad, but the trailer house were smart enough to keep them as quick shots.

A few of the parademons looked glossy, like video game characters.

This issue will probably be resolved by the time the movie releases and they will look more like the Knightmare scene (which was amazing).

Other than that, no issues - the cinematography is mindbogglingly beautiful and most of the CGI is great as well. </TEXT>
