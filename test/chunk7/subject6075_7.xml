	<TEXT> Physical appearance isn't everything, I have to assume if pedophilia is just an attraction, albeit a mental disorder as well, that you can try to focus on personality. I hope you can find the help you need to live a fufilling life </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try to focus on exceptions and not the rule. So far you sound like the exception, pedo who doesn't act, so continue to strive for the unlikely scenarios.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I have some hopefully helpful suggestions: 
 
I have a gay male friend who is flaming gay but had a crush on me, a female, for years. My lesbian friend put it like this: when someone's personality and soul is so beautiful, preference doesn't matter. I even have to suppress feelings for her because I like her personality so much ( I'm straight). So what I'm saying is continue to date if you wish. Make sure you share interest and chemistry. Anything can happen. Plus Asian girls tend to look very young? But legal of course </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's about culture, it particularly pertains to the above article being that it's about children marrying their rapist. Our culture is definitely not as bad but I think pedophile culture is a real thing. It sounds completely ridiculous especially if you don't see it around you. I just wanted to put the article here to inform anyone who wanted to check out more info on the matter. It's definitely something to think about. Btw I don't think men are evil or anything, I just think sex and women are too prevalent in our culture. From being oversexualized in Entertainment to being "temptresses" or oppressed in religion it's everywhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rape culture, this is a response to the statement that rape culture is not real. Yes there are plenty of great respectful men out there. Obviously you are not part of the problem. But saying it's not real just because you were raised right does not make it true. I know too many guys who would not rape a girl but would not stop a friends from drunk raping a girl. That's part of the problem. Men not correcting bad behaviors of other men. At least that's what I've researched and seen myself </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are so ignorant to this topic you have to be a male which is why you are so blind to what women go through. The U.S basically teaches us that men can't help themselves and rape is inevitable. It's normal for women to feel unsafe everywhere they go. Teens and jailbait happens to be the most popular category in porn websites. And not to mention that women are made to feel gross if they don't shave every part of their body so they basically resemble a prepubescent girl. Men have American women right where they want them. And they typical sentence for a rapist is like 8 years and they usually get out sooner then that and RAPE AGAIN. No this is not normal.  </TEXT>
