	<TEXT> I begin the tear down phase of the project. The Integra GSR was a donor and is being harvested of all the parts I can salvage for the 97 Honda Civic hatchback project car. I will eventually pull the suspension and other exterior bits but spent today pulling all interior items that I can sell on ebay to pay for the whole swap. The goal is to recoup all of the cost of the b18c swap by parting out the GSR shell and strip it bare.  </TEXT>
