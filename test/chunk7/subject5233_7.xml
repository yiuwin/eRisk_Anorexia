	<TEXT> Agreed during the pens momentum both of those called overlooked? I mean those are 100% calls if the refs were calling a consistent game. Then they call a trip. Sheesh fortunate we still won imo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How many slewfoots are 100% intentional? I mean almost all slewfoots are one player competing. It's still a penalty and a possible game. I don't like to see any player slewfooted, could end a career. (his leg kicks paquette's pretty damn intentionally lol.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Momentum is caused by calls and missed calls. You cant deny the slewfoot that would have kicked any player out of the game and he wouldnt be able to score the 3rd goal. Tampa had momentum until then just sayin. No need to homer goggle on that missed call sorry. </TEXT>
