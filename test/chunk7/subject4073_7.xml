	<TEXT> With Sarah in their alliance, was it a smart move for the 6 to vote out Zeke? They all knew that after doing this all it would take would be one person to flip to no longer have majority, and Sarah has been flipping back and forth this whole time. So is it smart at all to position yourself in an alliance of 5, where only one person needs to flip to screw you over, and one person has proven themselves very comfortable with flipping? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> probably not, the winners usually are satisfied and the losers are unsatisfied. I just think that, with the margins of how many people were against it, it's wierd to just be like "okay guess we're just going to ignore those people and continue business as usual." Like if it were 80-20 or something I would understand that more but it just seems like a lot of people's opinions or preferences are being swept aside. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think storywise the anime is great, it's been doing a great job of giving each character a lot of focus. I think I heard somewhere or got the sense from someone talking about the manga back when season 1 finished that the next arc wouldn't be as focused on Eren/Mikasa/Armin, and I was disappointed to hear that because it didn't sound like the story was going to go in an interesting direction, but I've actually really been enjoying it.

I think I was expecting going into this season for it to be something like Lost where we really didn't get any answers and the show just kept getting more bizarre and mysterious, so I was surprised in the premiere when the wall-titan was directly addressed by the characters as being something weird in the world. I don't know why I wasn't expecting that, but I think in that vein there are a lot of things that feel more concrete and real than I was expecting and so I'm really happy about that.

My only gripe with the anime is the actual animation. It's beautiful, yes, but there are a lot of times where no characters in the background are moving or there are just complete still shots. I get that they didn't have the biggest budget, it just ruins immersion a little bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what we've seen though, it doesn't seem like all shifters are a part of the same group. There are anti-human shifters or special titans like the Armored Titan, Colossal Titan, and Beast Titan (although I guess those three aren't confirmed to be shifters but it seems implied to me) and then there are pro-human shifters like Eren and Ymir. It seems to me like maybe some people were turned into shifters to fight titans while others were turned into shifters to fight humans. Idk though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People always complain about this on reddit but it's based on a misunderstanding of what guys mean when they say they are friendzoned. Being friendzoned isn't viewing women as sexual property and being disappointed when they don't put out. It's about unrequited feelings. Wanting to be more than friends with someone and having them only want to be friends is painful whether you're a woman or man or both, it's not about sex at all. </TEXT>
