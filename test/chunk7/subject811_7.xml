	<TEXT> As of yet, our amazing mod /u/Condensor has been taking time out of his schedule to put these tabs together as they don't exist anywhere on the internet yet.  
He streams on twitch every so often to share the process of how he breaks down the song. You should check it out, he'll post updates for it when he's going live here!  
In the meantime, you may have to wait for someone/him to get around to making the transcript for this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At this point, VIP isn't really worth it. 

 They've changed it since the Toronto show and won't be meeting fans to get pictures with them; now they just sit you at a Q A and give you a signed poster.  

Just a heads up!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Phobos gets plenty of love! They're all pretty equally admired.  

I also know of a couple people who've had successful lessons from him. Those fans are around, maybe they're just quiet like him. :) </TEXT>
