	<TEXT> Even assuming he is just as strong as Tatsumaki, that would warrant the highest threat level, God.

Just imagine Tatsu turning on the heroes. She'd just send the whole Association into space or something. No hero can resist getting dragged like a ragdoll by her telekinesis. 

And Mob doesn't even have Tatsumaki's weakness. So he could pretty much destroy the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I say that the highest priority, excluding God leaders, LR Goku and Gogeta, must be PHY SSJ Gotenks.

You read that right.

That's the guy you can slap in every meta team, super sealing + his links and passive are always wanted, you can make a spot for him. Sometimes he's even more useful than Gogeta.

So you may as well do maximum damage when using him. </TEXT>

Few things you post online should have consequences on the real world, this is not one of them. 

That picture alone had no real consequences, no african american lost their job by it, so the students shouldn't lose their scholarship.

	<TEXT> Buuhan had absorbed the kids and knew how much of a boost they got fusing, he also had Piccolo's brains.

And he was confident that Goku and Vegeta doing the fusion dance wasn't enough to beat him. 

I'd say he did the math. Since Vegito went SSJ right off the bat in the manga, since it was probably not enough to deal with Buuhan, we can just imagine that Base Vegito = Super Gogeta. 

Or maybe not, maybe even at base he's stronger. Power levels were crazy at Buu saga, Base Gotenks was stronger than SSJ3 Goku. Fusions are crazy and Potara's fusion is even crazier. </TEXT>

What a relief, this Buuhan event is too annoying, not worth trying to win 10 times. At least one can walk away with something good for less pain.

I'd also say that Kid Buu is worth putting in SS tier. If you pull another one, you shouldn't raise Buff Buu SA.

They pretty much have only ATK links and share them all except the TUR one, it's worth using both on a Mono-TEQ. If they link together it would be crazy.

He only gets a small increase in power by dokkaning, SSR version is still pretty tough. </TEXT>

Super Vegito friend is obvious choice, not only because he is strong, but because of Power Bestowed by God.

The subs is where it gets difficult. I already won 5 times but it depends on luck.

Right now I'm running Golden Frieza, PHY Super Gotenks, Kibitokai, Ultimate Gohan and Whis, hoping for a lucky stun.

I managed to hit that much using a Rebirth SSJ2 Goku (50% STR ATK) and a Gogeta friend SA 10, AFTER a Vegito SA. (and Vegito's passive adds another 25% atk)

With double 70% ATK up... well, I'm still not sure if he'll outdamage the God Leaders, lets wait for Buuhan tests and Omega Shenron's passive.

	<TEXT> Yeah, can confirm. It's not bigoted to talk like that about Mexico, people there really are what would be considered "rednecks" in USA, and thugs.

You already know the problems with that kind of ppl so no need to go further. Rednecks and thugs are the majority. 

And Japan is indeed majestic, you all downvoting should go check it up. I mean, except for the salarymen, that looks like hell, but they managed to be homogeneous and have a cool culture.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's no STR Super Buu so this might be the chance to do it.

Very doubtful tho, he isn't relevant right now. I guess Buutenks will dokkan to fill that void.

Btw, a dokkaned Buucolo would be silly strong. I was already considering him for a mono-INT team, since he heals for 25% of the damage he does. A dokkan would give him good ATK stat and maybe 30% heal. I imagine him hitting for 70k with god leaders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, for general use, I say it's between Buutenks and Beerus.

They both achieve ATK higher than the average SSR under the right conditions.

SR Beerus linked with TEQ Whis is actually stronger than him. Of course, that doesn't matter now since he dokkans.

And Buutenks getting a full row of red orbs (could be even more if you get lucky) has reached 28k for me, or at least pretty close.

Buutenks will jump straight to SS tier with a dokkan, or at least a solid S. I already consider him pretty close to S being a SR, only his stats hold him back.

He has this special combination of utility (Super sealer) with a damage passive and relevant links, so you're not hindering your team by using him.

Buu also has a use for events, like Blue. On Super strike events he is MVP giving +3 ki to Gogeta for a low cost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since his passive is already a high chance of stunning, I hope they give him the Gotenks treatment and slap a 30% ATK increase on him.

That is a surprisingly good way of keeping cards relevant, I find that  cards with no % increase are really weak unless it is a really big flat boost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meruem wakes up on Ash's body and discovers Team Rocket trying to follow him, they are annoying and he decides to fight them barehanded.

He doesn't have his tail or strenght anymore but is ruthless enough to win against their small pokemen and beat them badly.

Then he goes on to ask them about the world. They understand he's some powerful entity on the brat's body and are too afraid to lie, so he gets reliable info about pokemon, trainers, gyms, etc.

On Round One, he wins mid-hard diff. 

He would train like a madman to know the full extent of his pokemon's powers, he may even train them to max level, depending on how the anime works, I don't remember if they get stronger over fights. 

But even assuming he has them at the same level as Ash, he will know them better.

He's a King with a powerful presence and a personality fit to be a Ruler, that would allow him to command even Charizard on the first league, and of course, he surely learned all the theory before participating, so his strategies will be perfect. 

Meruem on HxH was already the perfect gamer, he was learning every possible strategy game and perfecting them within 10 matches. Ash came pretty close to winning everytime, so Meruem should accomplish it.

Except for Tobias, now that would be a match worth seeing. Meruem is the perfect strategist, but fighting against legendaries is a real handicap. He'd enjoy this fight. Instead of overpowering Tobias with brains, his wits would only close the gap between their teams. It could go both sides. But he'd take Darkrai down like a bitch using Heracross, that's for sure. 

Round Two: Low diff.

He travels the world catching pokemon befriending them and uses teams with glorious synergy, but he's actually looking for the very strongest. 

Strategy is a tool for the weak to overcome someone better, if he wants to be the absolute King of Pokemon, he needs to get Legendary Pokemon with so much raw power that there's nothing to do against them. 

He gets Ho-Oh, Kyogre, Cresselia, Terrakion, Yveltal and eventually Mewtwo. They'd follow him outside their pokeballs and roflstomp everyone.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Analysis] Has anyone paid attention to TEQ SS2 Goku's leader skill? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-22 12:48:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I see him on Z tier, but after searching the whole place I see no one talking about his leader skill, which is even incorrectly written on his character analysis and tier list.

Maybe people saw that and overlooked it, since it's listed as +50% HP and DEF for STR   TEQ. 

But it's wrong! It's 50% HP AND ATK for those 2 types. He'd be actually pretty underwhelming/WT niche if his only worth was a +3 ki passive, since he isn't hitting hard anytime soon, but boy am I happy of pulling him.

If you don't have a god leader, just use this banner with double rates featuring him and get yourself a mini-god. 50% is as good as an undokkaned GOD, and I'm sure they'd still be top tier without being TURs

So yeah, just a heads up. He obviously won't replace a GOD leader if you already have one, but if you don't, this guy is many times easier to get and does the same job, one big boost to HP   ATK. If you already have him, congrats.

And the fact that it gives a boost to STR type comes especially handy considering than most people with Gogeta would be taking him into any battle, at least that's what I do, putting to use those insane stats.

Also remember, even tho he doesn't provide ki with his leader skill, his passive makes up for it (+3 ki to STR/TEQ), so it isn't really hard to SA if your team has good linking and orb manipulation (TEQ has Bardock and SSB Goku)

I finally feel "in the meta" again with him, Gogeta was getting rusty. With a SS3 Gotenks support and this guy you can go over 100k life and that's pretty. 

Really happy they put this character outside a Dokkanfest. Maybe they'll start releasing more characters like this? HP   ATK for 2 types and no Ki   DEF boost. It could work for those who can't get the very best ones. They wouldn't be as good without a +3 ki passive tho. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> THIS

I was just thinking about this. 

I recommended HxH to a friend and he's starting the election arc, I know he'll have issues with Alluka and I already planned to tell him a little mental fix.

Imagine all the healed Gon stuff being just a dream Alluka gave him, her power isn't absolute and she could only remove the dark Nen to finally give him a peaceful death, this assuming he was trapped into a nightmare. 

Killua managed to at least free Gon from his endless suffering and walks away with Alluka to never be seen again. Leorio failed to protect his friend and changes his personality, becoming much more serious about being a doctor, we get to see him skipping parties and stuff only to study, with some tears falling on the book he's reading. 

Days later, Kurapika checks up his phone only to see Leorio's desperate messages but now it's too late. He breaks down after realizing what he lost and how much of an hypocrite he was for letting them down. We get some scenes without dialogue on him travelling and doing research.

He's last seen arriving at the spider's nest and facing the entire Phantom Troupe ready to die going berserk on them, having lost the will to live.

Now the last scene of Meruem and Komugi holding hands coming after all of that hits even harder.

But of course, Kurapika dying would interfere with Togashi's next arc, but the 2011 anime could have ended like that on a tragic note. 

I kinda let myself go there, in my defense I just finished the anime a few days ago and I'm still influenced by Togashi's dark writing.  </TEXT>

He's like an undokkaned GOD leader, he doesn't give 2 ki but his passive gives 3, so he's one of the best leaders you can use. He's replacing Gogeta for me since I don't have any GOD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I talk from experience, I tried to use a villain team to farm AGL Whis and ended up sick after 3 fights.

Way too boring. They don't do crap. No good leader skill, I used Raditz, Turles just came out a day ago. Now I think that he's pretty much mandatory to make villains work. 

But even then, they lack damage. Barely any links and best leader skill is a vanilla +3 ki. I rarely get to 100k with only villains. "Oh yeah, I finally managed to get my Bojack to SA!... That's all? 60k?" 

Those 2 events are great to compare their efficiency. And yeah maybe with FP Frieza or PHY Broly it would be easy, but those are pretty much units of the highest tier and dokkanfest exclusives, meanwhile Heroes don't depend on Vegito or Gogeta to be strong. </TEXT>
