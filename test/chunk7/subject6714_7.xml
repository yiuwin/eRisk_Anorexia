When we were at his place, and he wanted to watch something on TV, I kept my mouth shut, even though I thought it was the biggest idiocy on the planet (he had a fondness of German romantic made-for-TV films). When he was at our place and we wanted to watch a film, he would not stop ranting about how stupid that film was, until we told him to shut the fuck up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tengo 45 pirulos y me acuerdo bien de esa poca (como muchos, aprovech el dlar barato para viajar y ver el mundo). 

El problema un poco fue que muchos terminaron siendo rehenes del 1 a 1 (con una buena dosis de sndrome de Estocolmo, tambin). Por ej. mis viejos en 92 sacaron una hipoteca en dlares, lo mismo que mucha otra gente que conoca entonces. Si mal no me acuerdo, haba hipotecas en pesos, pero los intereses eran considerablemente ms altos y puede que hasta las condiciones del prstamo hayan sido ms estrictas. 

Ahora, imaginate si hubiesen soltado la convertibilidad. Incluso si la devaluacin hubiese sido ordenada y gradual, como vos decs, de un da para el otro la hipoteca (o cualquier otro crdito que hayas tomado en dlares) se te habra encarecido en un 50% y, al no haber inflacin entonces, difcilmente tu salario se habra incrementado lo suficiente como para hacer frente a la mayor deuda. 

Pero estoy especulando y me gustara que alguien me confirme si estoy en lo correcto o no. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There doesn't seem to be much "proper" science behind acupuncture. According to [this article](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/an-industry-of-worthless-acupuncture-studies/)

 carefully controlled scientific studies consistently show that it does not matter where you stick the needles or even if you insert needles (as opposed to just poking the skin with dull needles, or retracting needles, or even tooth picks). To further support this conclusion, the perceived effectiveness of acupuncture does not depend on the degree of training or experience of the acupuncturist (so whatever they are learning has no effect), but only upon how warm and nice they are to the patient. In short, acupuncture is an elaborate placebo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, let me see.

Airlines were still offering smoking flights as recently as the late 90s (source: I travelled quite a bit back then), though only in some long-haul routes, maybe to and from Japan, IIRC. All the rest were non-smoking by then. Was it self-regulatory? I don't know, in any case it's good because you're stuck several hours on a plane, without the possibility of even opening a window.

 Also doctors used to advocate smoking,

Some doctors did, and likely bribed by the industry to deny the scientific consensus that goes back to the 1920, IIRC. It's almost as if a doctor today recommended a diet of donuts and coke.

hell in the past they've shown kids smoking on TV like it's just a bit of fun.

And they also showed them drinking, so? 

I still don't see what any this has to do with smoking at pubs. </TEXT>

Relying on donations is a safer bet than putting ads that many people will block regardless.

	<TEXT> I fully agree. The reason I installed adblocking software was because the ads became a) a risk, b) way too intrusive. I don't mind banners that aren't hosted in third party servers and have no animation or sound, anymore than I mind printed ads on a magazine. 

However, I don't agree with your piracy analogy. In order to see a film or a cable TV show I have to either pay ticket/fee/buy media or wait until it gets broadcast on network TV. In contrast, if I want to read a non-paywalled electronic version of a newspaper or magazine, I don't have to pay for it, nor am I under any obligation to click on any of the ads. 

All that being said, though, enforcing a ban on adblocking software would be every bit as easy as getting rid of torrent sites or clients. </TEXT>

The other I found out that a guy I sometimes meet at one my regular pub believes in chemtrails. And he was showing pictures of contrails he had taken with his mobile the day before. 

I asked him who he thought was behind that and why were they doing it, also whether he had ever considered the type of infrastructure that something like that would need, and that kind thing. He responded with the usual "but there are more of them lines now than back in the day!". I explained him that of course, because there are a lot more planes flying around and above the country (I live in the Czech Republic) than there were back in the day.

I don't know if I was able to change his mind, but at least he shut up, and I may have planted a seed of doubt, and I'd be happy if that turns out the be case. And I believe that is the case, it's a person by person "fight" (for lack of a better word) and, more often than not, you will have to make do with just planting a seed of doubt. </TEXT>

Recent statistics have shown that more than 50% of pubs, etc. in the country are now non-smoking, and most new places are so from the start, so there's plenty to choose from and I don't see why someone who wants to have smoke while drinking a few beers or a cup of coffee with their friends shouldn't have a place where they can go.

	<TEXT> About Prague:

The best place to get your fix of Bohemian brews is the Czech capital. Although the Pilsener style originated in the town of Plze, Prague is a great place to enjoy it, whether youre on a shoestring budget or living it up. Dont miss **U Flecku**(1)  a tavern thats been brewing beer for over 500 years! This 1200-seater spot **rarely has a seat readily available** (2), but it is worth the wait. The dark lager they serve up is full of frothy, chocolately goodness, and the chaos of the tourists, waiters, and accordion players just adds to the charm. Other specialty brews include the **St. Thomas dark beer at The Augustine, which is even today made by the practicing friars who live in the vicinity** (3), and the hilltop Strahov Monastery. One thing you should know before hitting up the City of Spires is **the word pivovar which translates to beer bar**(4). Trust us, itll hold you in good stead.

(1) It's U Fleku

(2) Maybe in the evenings, otherwise you can walk in a grab a seat during most of the day. The beer is great, the place's a tourist trap.

(3) I would love to know where they go that from, because it's utter bullshit. The brewery was shut down in the 1950s, and even then I doubt there were any monks brewing. The pub operated until 2002 or 3 and now the site is a fancy hotel and the dark beer available is made by Matuka, and it's his standard dark lager.

(4) No! "Pivovar" is Czech for "Brewery". 

I didn't bother with the rest of the cities. My bet is that Karina hasn't visited Prague, and probably any of those towns. </TEXT>

El deportista discapacitado, ms all del grado de su discapacidad y el nivel de competencia en el que participe, tiene que entrenar, si quiere ganar, tiene que ser mejor que los otros (incluso, si lo que decs sobre los ciegos es cierto, que quizs lo es). Va a tener que correr ms rpido, va a tener que tirar el disco ms lejos, va a tener que ser fs fuerte, etc. 

Yo no estoy diciendo que la mina esta es pelotuda, no la conozco, pero estoy casi seguro que su estilo de vida no es el ms sano. No alcanz ese grado de obesidad de un da para el otro y la gentica podr jugar su papel, pero al fin y al cabo, el control sobre lo que coms y no, lo tens vos. La solucin en este caso es simple, morf menos, movete ms. Lo cual no quiere decir que sea fcil, como con toda adiccin.

En contraste, ac tens una mina que est enferma porque come mucho y se mueve poco (y s, la responsabilidad, si es adulta, es de ella; es bien sabido ya, y desde hace mucho, que ser obeso no es sano, y a esta piba nadie le est obligando a ponerle otra cuchara de dulce de leche al flan) y la premian por "ser la ms linda" (la ms linda segn quin?), o sea, la estn alentando a seguir gorda, a seguir enferma.  </TEXT>
