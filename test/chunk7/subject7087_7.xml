And talking about so-called jokes, you wouldn't think the guy who literally [sued a comedian over an *orangutan sex* joke for $5million](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/06/showbiz/trump-bill-maher-suit/) would think it's appropriate to 'joke' about the president being and terrorist and treason. Obama probably has a much better case.   </TEXT>
