EDIT: Fantastic job, by the way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not so well versed with the hardware aspect of PCs, but a friend (and others here) said the stock fan(s) would be fine as long as I don't overclock, so that's saving money. 

And yeah, you're right about the keyboard haha. But I'm really biased towards it for some reason... _ </TEXT>

Between a 1x8 and 4x2.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there a difference in 2x8 or two 2x4? Other than the 2x4's being more expensive. 

And I do kinda care for graphics, but if I need to start playing games in medium-high in a year or two, it wouldn't be much of a hassle.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you enjoy overwhelming hopelessness and impending suffering, like Berserk, then the manga for Bokurano is a definite recommendation. It's also the only manga I've enjoyed more than Berserk, if that's worth anything. 

Shamo is arguably similar since both MC's (Guts and the dude-from-Shamo) are pretty fucked up and neither series pulls any punches.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the heads up! Unfortunately, I already payed last night, but will keep this in mind for the future. Sorry to hear about them stealing your artwork; is there really nothing that could've been done? Sounds like them doing that + being a shady company is fairly easy potential to sue them up the arse.  </TEXT>
