	<TEXT> Well I mean it's not like Xhaka has been very good. Gives away possession constantly, commits stupid fouls, doesn't really give us much going forward. I definitely have not been impressed. He was pretty terrible yesterday against the press, and if he's better than Kante technically, then why did he struggle? I don't think Kante was or will be the answer to our problems, but so far Xhaka hasn't been either. 

I know I'm going to get downvoted for this but I just haven't been impressed personally.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Garcon's contract is gonna be bigger than $5 million. He will probably take a pay cut, but not that big of one. Also, I don't see us taking a RB and a WR back to back to start the draft. I think they'll go with Kelley next year. I think we might pick up a WR in free agency or later in the draft to fill the spot Jackson will leave, but we definitely won't get one that early. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alexis stole the show, but this was very much a team performance. I think our fullbacks deserve a ton of credit, Monreal put so many good balls into the box, and I don't think Payet got past Gabriel at all. 

Xhaka and Coq both played really well. I think we need to go with that pairing. Love Xhaka's passing ability, and paired with Coq's workrates and pace, can prove to be effective. Just worried they'll get themselves sent off at some point.

The Ox was outstanding. Wish he had the confidence to play like this every week. That goal should do wonders for him though. 

With Alexis at striker, Ozil doesn't seem to be getting as many assists this year. I think the new style of play Alexis brings is limiting his options for assisting, instead of when Giroud is in and he has an actual target man. I really doubt Ozil is upset with this though because he's the type of player who just wants to win, and he's getting a good goal tally now. Happy that he continues to contribute.  </TEXT>

-That goal from the Ox was insane. Love him with confidence.
-Monreal was great going forward today. Deserved an assist
-Gabriel can serve as a viable RB replacement if necessary. I think we should continue to play him there until Bellerin gets back.
-Other than his stupid yellow card, Coq played very well. Growing to like the Xhaka-Coq combination

	<TEXT> Ok. Wenger, it's time to stop. The Alexis at striker experiment needs to end. It doesn't work. He spent more time played DM today than striker. Giroud MUST be starting. He provides a scoring threat. Alexis needs to be back on the wing.

Elneny was so horrible. He gives us nothing. I don't understand why Xhaka didn't start today. We need creativity, not sideways pass after sideways pass.

Ramsey was horrible today as well, but when moved back into the midfield, he played much much better. Just shows that's where he needs to be playing.

We need Bellerin. Jenko wasn't necessarily bad today, but he doesn't give us anything going forward. It's going to be tough without him.

Overall this was a really bad performance saved by Wenger's subs, so we have to give him credit for that. But the lineup he put out was not creative enough going forward.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If we want to go for a point, we can stay exactly like we are and maybe bring Xhaka on at around the 70th minute.

But we need to win this game. 

Ramsey has been bad today, bring Iwobi on. Ramsey has not been creative enough today. Also, we need Giroud to come on. This Alexis at striker thing has gone pretty badly today. And we need Xhaka instead of Elneny. I'm really not sure why Xhaka didn't start, but Elneny has not been good. He provides no attacking threat and rarely makes a forward pass it seems. 

We have no direction in this lineup. Nothing going forward. We're making Phil Jones and Rojo look like Hummels and Boateng. Defensively for us however, I think we've been very good. I can't see United getting a goal if our defense stays as focused as we do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My worry is that if we don't sign Cousins to a big, long term deal, then we're back where we were in 2011. Do we draft a new one, or pick up a low end starter from free agency? Whether you like him or not, Cousins is an efficient QB. He just needs to figure out how to get things going early in the season. After the first two games though he's been pretty solid, shaky at times but mostly solid. While I don't think he's worth $20 million, that's what you've gotta pay these days to get a guy like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Theo was one of the main reasons I started to support Arsenal. I've been very critical of him lately (I really wanted us to sell him this summer) but he's completely redefined his game. I love his defensive work, and he's playing smart football. I really hope he can keep this form up for the whole season, and hopefully he doesn't get injured. Glad he's doing well again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to see Ospina; Bellerin, Mustafi, Kos, Monreal; Cazorla, Xhaka; Walcott, Ozil, Ox; Perez

Keep the back 4 because while it's a team from Bulgaria, they're still a legitimate team and I'd like us to take these games seriously.

Xhaka because he's going to be out next weekend.

Cazorla should be fit because he wasn't with Spain.

Walcott and Ozil for obvious reasons.

I want to see Ox get a start. If he isn't performing bring Iwobi on.

Perez needs a start and we need to rest Alexis. Maybe bring him on if we are in trouble. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was half of the reason that Pryor scored. Norman was trailing him and Blackmon didn't step in front to stop the ball. Lack of communication between the two.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're being outplayed by Burnley at the moment. Cech's distribution has been so poor because they're blocking off passing lanes to the defenders, forcing him to play long balls to players who aren't tall enough to win headers, not to mention his distribution is bad as it is. We look very tired, especially Ozil. I think we need to make some changes. Very happy with Iwobi, Koscielny, and Mustafi so far though. </TEXT>
