	<TITLE> What I'd do with tomorrowland </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-28 01:57:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With the recent Tomorrowland announcements, I've been thinking about what exactly they could do to make the land better. I have thought up my own idea of what they could (realistically) do. Here are my thoughts.

1. Peoplemover track  )  
While it would be nice to get peoplemover back, there would have to be a ton of work on the tracks and everything else. Completely removing the track would also require a massive amount of work and closure time. If I were Disney, I would turn the track into a walkway, taking you around tomorrowland from above. It would give Tomorrowland a 2-level feel which I think would add to the futuristic effect. The inside buildings could be exhibits, restraunts, shops etc. The entrance to space mountain could also be moved to the upper level clearing the bottom level of that building for other attractions. It would also help traffic in tomorrowland, as that is one of the main issues at the moment.
(TL/DR: Make it a walkway. Put entrance to space on it)

2. Astro Orbiter)   
Move it or remove it. Possibly make it on that launch platform next to the space mountain queue. Either way it's current location should serve as an entry way to the second level pathway which should take up less space.
(Tl/DR: Move or Remove)

3. Star Tours )   
They would have to remove and replace it because of Star Wars land. I don't know what to put here. I'm sure Disney can figure something out. I would say maybe a mission space, realistic type, ride but I'm not really sure.

4. Autopia/Lagoon )   
While I don't like this ride, It is a classic and I think it should be kept. However, I do think they should change the cars to be electric (or at least not sound like lawn-mowers). The submarine ride would also be fine to keep. It eats up crowds and is basically harmless.

5. Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters.  )   
While its not super fitting, I like the ride so I think it should stay.

6. Starcade  )    
With the space opened up because of the upper level, they could do just about anything with this. Possibly more seating for Pizza Port. They could also just completely close this area and use it for backstage.

7. Innoventions / launch bay building.  )   
This is the main thing I'm not sure about. They could demolish it and put something else there or keep it for backstage. They could keep it and put something inside the building. Honestly its pretty difficult to come up with what they could do with it. Realistically, I would say repaint it and put some show or ride in.


Thats about all the ideas I have for tomorrowland. I think that Disney could make this land great again without having to do something very drastic. I don't know if they will do anything like I've said here but I feel like these are fairly good ideas. Leave any thoughts if you agree or disagree with anything I put here. Thanks!

	<TEXT> It will. However turning time off then on again should fix it. So basically try to get time off from your boss (if he's still alive) and then go into work for overtime. Overtime should override the off switch and turn time back on. Afterwards it should be okay to set the time back. Good luck!!! </TEXT>
