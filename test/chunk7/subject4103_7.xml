	<TEXT> Sex between a man and a woman is ordered toward procreation, even if the actual mechanics of the conception are interrupted by injured or removed parts. As long as the act can still be performed, a marriage is valid. And just as long as you engage in the marital act with the intent to accept a new life that may be conceived by it, it would not be a sin. God has worked miracles in the past with those the world called sterile or barren. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remember that sexual sins aren't the be-all end-all of morality; it's just the fact that we live in a sex-obsessed culture that makes them seem unforgivable. Your sin does not define you. Once you receive baptism, you will be washed clean of the stain of any sin, and the fact that you are currently directly on that path indicates that God is already working within you. You are not any more unclean or broken than any other person who has committed a mortal sin (every single human being ever, with a couple of notable exceptions), and any man who would refuse to marry you on account of that isn't worth your time. You are not a whore. Again, your sin does not define you. You are a beautifully, wonderfully made image of God, though you're stuck with a fallen human nature like the rest of us. Christ makes all things new in Himself, so keep pursuing Him and you can't go wrong.

Also, given your age and the age of the "boyfriend" with whom you had sex, your culpability is likely GREATLY reduced. You definitely objectively sinned, but this is an adult man who preyed upon a pubescent girl for his own gratification. He should worry about his soul far more. Also, you are living in a culture awash with sexually perverse messages that place sex simultaneously too high and too low in the mind of the populace. Combine that with a lack of religious upbringing and it's no surprise you took the path you did. 

That being said, your actions did objectively hurt you and your relationship with God, as well as having pragmatic effects. A person who has been sexually intimate with another responds differently to sexual situations than one who hasn't. They know what they're missing out on, so to speak, and what it would feel like. This makes it much harder to resist. You are in for a difficult battle, but nothing is impossible with God. You may fall again with regards to sex. Statistically, it's very likely. The important thing, however, is to never give up trying, and never cease returning to Christ in the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Even if you haven't committed a mortal sin, you can receive Grace just by confessing any venial sins.

Remember above all, that God loves you and always wants you to return to Him, the cause and source of our joy. God bless you and keep you. </TEXT>

So that means that there are people in the Great Sacred Grounds who are over two full realms above the best in Blue Wind Empire? Have we learned the realm above Sovereign? It seems that these things come in groups of ten, and with this ordering, Sovereign would be realm number nine. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I finally caught up. A lot of chapters in a short time. Now I have questions and comments to contribute. I had originally thought that the Four Great Sacred Grounds were the strongest places in the world, but it looks like they're only relevant to the Profound Sky Continent. Have we learned anything about the strengths or important locations outside of this continent, except vague references to the Realm of the Gods and the Azure Sky Continent that Yun Che's past self was on?

Another thing: despite his growth rate being monstrous, he's going to need to pick it up in order to fulfill his promise to Jasmine. Wasn't it Tyrant Profound Realm in 3 years? It's been half that time and he's at the top of the third realm - he still has Spirit, Earth, Sky, Emperor, and Sovereign Realms to break through. And each of these is incomparably more difficult. There only seem to be a few Sovreign Pround Realm practitioners on this continent, so he'll need to surpass the continent itself in another year and a half. Looks like he'll need even greater Deus Ex Machina interference to complete his task.

Also, does anyone else think his next step should be to go back to Floating Cloud City and rescue his grandfather and Little Aunt? His grandfather was at Spirit Profound Realm and was the strongest in the city, and Yun Che is proving that he can go toe to toe with Earth Realm practitioners, plus his name will spread across the continent due to this tournament. He could smack around the entire Xiao Clan without breaking a sweat. </TEXT>

The former is only part of the Blue Wind Empire, while the Divine Phoenix Empire is stronger than the entire Blue Wind Empire. The Mighty Heavenly Sword Region is one of the Four Great Sacred Grounds, and it was mentioned that the Divine Phoenix Empire was below all of these. I don't think we've seen internal rankings as to which of the Four Great Sacred Grounds is strongest, however. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right. I think that paragraph uses the sort of language that is perfectly fine for theologians and philosophers, but makes no sense to average people. Especially the use of the word "nature", which in common parlance means "stuff that happens in the world not caused by humans" while to someone familiar with Aristotle and Scholastics it means "that which is ordered toward the fulfillment of a thing". Also, the inordinate focus on women only being called to chastity (or more likely that men are seen as a lost cause) drives me up a wall and is something I'm trying to eliminate. Thanks for the insight. If you think of anything else, I'd like to hear more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saving souls is literally infinitely more important than saving lives. The difference is, aptly, as great as Heaven and Earth. You seem to be confused into thinking that the main mission of the Church is to provide material comfort in this world. That is not the goal of the Church. The Church's goal is to proclaim the Gospel and save souls. Feeding the poor, clothing the naked, etc. are simply means by which this can be accomplished. If anything, however "good" from a secular humanist standpoint, requires an intrinsic evil, it is not permitted. For example, if a madman was about to press a button to destroy all life on Earth, and he said that he would not press it if you murdered an innocent person, it would still not be permissible to do so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, while I can't say that I understand quantum physics as a specialty of mine, I understand the arguments behind it and the reasons people might think that it may indicate an absence of causality. For starters, it mistakenly refers only to efficient cause rather than any other type, and only in the sense of linear time ordering. All current quantum physics opines is that some events may not have direct efficient causes in time-order. It can't definitely say that it is certainly the case that these events have no cause.

It's just funny that you place equations over "trite" arguments, when science is fully dependent on philosophy. In order to make any sense of data and interpret it, you need to look through the lens of a given metaphysical and cosmological system. Don't confuse current mathematical models with reality. Simply because the equations are probabilistic does not mean reality is as well. It just means that a probabilistic model is our current best approach for mathematically representing the behavior of particles.

Regardless of any of that, my main point was that it is impossible to function as a human without a notion of causality in everyday life. It drives all scientific inquiry. Science would not be possible without causality, since it requires repeatable results. You may say that it only applies at the macroscopic level, but even if particles can only be mapped probabilistically, the laws of the universe are still the cause of it behaving with that particular probabilistic model as opposed to any other. In any case, in order to make decisions in everyday life and operate in society, a person needs to assume some level of causality, so it can never be eliminated except at the expense of humanity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Read it, and it's pretty much what I expected. Same objections Hume made in his original work, plus some quantum physics. Plus it relegates cause to efficient cause only. I understand the argument just fine - it just happens to be one that is completely useless for either scientific understanding or functioning as a human being. At some point I just have to think that if a person is willing to throw out causality itself in order to make a case against God's existence, the discussion is already pretty much over. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> This atheist argument </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-16 14:05:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Looking at the link for the Trent Horn caller as posted in /r/atheism, I came across this gem:

"Well, that was a waste of seven and a fraction minutes. I don't understand these arguments. Why does the atheist allow the theist to get away with the assertion that all actions require cause, thus an agent of cause? That's where the discussion begins, not wading in the mire of possible beginnings of our universe. On the other hand, physics has produced a number of potential explanations, none of which require a 'cause'.

The illusion of cause emerges from perception - our user interface, which evolved for efficient usefulness, not veracity."

Now, I didn't think there was anyone left that went full Hume and straight-up punted the causality ball, but there it is. How do you even respond when someone says that things don't need to have a cause in order to occur? It honestly just seems too pitiable to bother refuting. You have to give up not only God and the supernatural, but also anything interesting or meaningful about this world. Science, reason, morality, interpersonal relationships, consciousness...none of them are actually real. It would be impossible to actually function according to this principle. Even if it were true, why bother believing it, let alone convincing anyone else to do so? There's no benefit to it. Actually, there's no concept of "benefit" at all.

I guess I'm just looking for other people's views on this. Also, does anyone know of an argument proving the necessity of causality, just for the heck of it? Not that it would probably convince anyone who actually believes as this poster does. Once you're willing to abandon that much of your humanity, I think only God can pull you out, not any well-reasoned argument.

	<TEXT> Thanks for demonstrating exactly what I was arguing against. There is no basis for the belief that all of reality is perceptible through the senses, yet you clearly assume that to be the case based on your mocking tone. I believe that many things exist that are not material - neither matter nor energy. Truth, for example. Also love. 

By evidence that lends itself to theism, I would say that reported miracles and the like qualify, as well as the fact that the universe makes any sense at all, but there is always a possibility to simply apply a naturalistic interpretation of reality onto anything that happens. That's why it can never be proof. All evidence needs to be interpreted through a given metaphysical and cosmological framework. The evidence itself can never change that framework.

If you compare the prime mover of Aristotle (let alone a monotheistic personal God) to Vishnu, Thor, and the like, all you are doing is making an error in kind and showing that you don't actually understand the definitions of terms given, let alone the arguments in their favor. The fact that nobody can prove it doesn't exist is not the only reason for believing in it, and nobody said it was. The fact that God is a necessary being, as opposed to the contingent universe (or multiverse) is the reason to believe in God. </TEXT>

And then there's the faith of future children to think of. After dating several atheists, agnostics, and non-denominational Christians, I'd now date only other practicing Catholics, or possibly a well-churched Orthodox girl (still hoping for a mending to the schism). Of course, at the moment God seems to have other plans for me since I'm in seminary, so it's a moot point for me personally. I'd still say that sharing faith (even the particulars) is vital for romantic relationships to have a future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually think that Horn didn't address the key weak point in the argument. God is not part of the natural world, so any attempt to look for a natural or scientific explanation of Him will fail. Though, as he said, you can find evidence that lends itself to theism. Never definitive proof though. The key thing is that there is also no evidence to prove that science works as a system. You can't prove a system's truth by its own rules. That's where the caller's argument falls flat on its face. There is no evidence that you can only arrive at truth through evidence. You always need some sort of philosophy to back you up. That's where arguments like the prime mover can come into play. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the thing about multiverse theory is that it doesn't actually say "there are infinite universes where all things that can be imagined happen". Rather, each universe has a different set of laws and physical constants as bounded by the Feynmann equations. Like all science, it only explains the natural world and cannot make any claims on the supernatural one. </TEXT>
