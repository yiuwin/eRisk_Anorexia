	<TEXT> Super late, but...
One time my friend's family was having a BBQ. At the time, I had injured my foot because I ran and jumped a lot, and the final moment that really pushed it over the edge was me jumping out of a 6 foot tree onto concrete without landing properly. So this one kid is about 13 or 14, a couple years older than us at the time. This kid goes back inside and starts playing on their family computer (that nobody said he could use, that wasn't his) so then like 15 minutes later me and my friend come inside and want to use the computer, and we see this shitdonkey sitting on the computer staring at a game. Not even playing it, just staring at what's happening on screen. (I'm assuming it was sort of like one of those "Infection" style games where you monitor what's happening in the world or a state or something like Plague, Inc.) So I'm like, "Hey, can you please get off the computer so we can use it?" (we'll nickname him KV from now on for the sake of convenience.)

KV: Why?

ME: Because it's not your computer and nobody said you could use it.

KV: I'll be off in a minute.

Surprise, surprise, one minute passes, I come back, and say, "Your one minute is up."

KV gets really pissed off at this and says "It's just a metaphor. Why do you not understand that?"

ME: Because you said one minute. If you wanted two minutes, you'd say two minutes. If you wanted 15 minutes, you'd say 15 minutes, but no, you said one minute. If I hear you'll be off in a minute, that means a minute. 60 seconds. No, "I'll be off in a minute but I'll actually be off in 15" kind of stuff, just one minute.

KV: *silently goes back to playing his game*

ME: *hobbles over and closes his tab*

KV: *smashes fist on keyboard* What was that?! Why the heck did you do that, (subject9873)!

ME: Because you said one minute. It wasn't one minute.

He then tries to intimidate me by chasing me. Unfortunately I had an injured foot, so when he started chasing me I couldn't really run. I had to leave before the whole situation was finished, but according to my friend he got grounded for a month. </TEXT>
