	<TEXT> Haha thanks. I noticed myself that I have pretty good genetics to get the standard 'aesthetic' looks. However that's not my goal in the end. I actually just want to get really strong at both barbell lifts and gymnastic exercises as well as being athletic in general. I must admit that currently I am focusing mostly on hypertrophy though ;)

	<TEXT> Wow, that's a long time you've been having this problem. In my deepest point, I did not necessarily started looking down on others for eating unhealthy stuff but for some reason I did think it was somehow morally superior to eat very little and exercise a lot. Keep up the work, you good luck too m8 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah! It feels good to know that I have got so much room for improvement as my body catches up :)

Thanks for the feedback. I know my squats should be deeper. However when I go parallel I start getting butt wink. I am now working on ankle flexibilty to solve the issue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right. When I started training last year I did not let my body recover enough and was training daily. I have now learned about the importance of rest days and deloads however. I still tend to push too hard sometimes and sometimes I get caught up in researching and thinking about training.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "...I think the trap bar deadlift is the better option overall." That's what Greck Nuckols says, and that's why I mostly use the trap bar. Plus, it just feels a lot better and I feel the movement in my hams and glutes a lot more, while with the normal deadlift I mostly feel it in my lower and upper back.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mixing strength and hypertrophy in the same workout </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A lot of routines start out with heavier compound exercises and then have you move on to higher reps for hypertrophy However, I have heard that it is not good to do this, because it would interfere with the desired adaptation, so you're better off separating strength/max effort days from hypertrophy/volume days. It kinda makes sense, because if you do bench press 3x5 for strength and then do incline dumbbell presses 3x12, you are using different energy pathways, different motor unit activation and all that stuff, and your body will adapt to both forms of stimulation but in an inferior manner. 

PS: sorry for possible bad English.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Old-school bodybuilders used to do it a lot. Squats, milk and dumbbell pullovers. Some even say it will expand your ribcage. What is true?  </TEXT>
