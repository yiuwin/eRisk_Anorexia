	<TEXT> Go north of skull lake. There is an enemy camp that almost only fires bomb arrows. 
Go while it's raining hard and bomb arrows won't ignite (and you can tell when they do). Get there attention and stand back. Not very fast but it's the only Method I know of.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I happened to do the same thing recently, so instead of using the interactive map, I used a list. It listed shrines in what tower region they were in, along with a map showing them all. Was very helpful to get the last few shrines. Having it broken into sections like that made it a lot easier (for me) than the interactive map.

This is the list I used.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are 120 shrines and each gives one spirit orb. 2 extra wheels of stamina is max (3 total) and 30 hearts is maxed. But you can't max both out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. Completely this. Weapons break so often that it's no use worrying about that one early in the game. I have many weapons I don't even use because I want them when I really need them but it doesn't even matter because as soon as a weapon breaks, there is usually one around to replace it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same here. Although, if need be, I will just create another user and start that way. I would greatly prefer if you could just switch our current games over to hard mode though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uhh... no. Bomb arrows don't ignite in the rain and if they happen to, you can easily tell. They sorta spark before they are fired. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah that's a good place to get arrows too. There is also a place north of skull lake where, if it is raining hard, you can farm bomb arrows. Not nearly as quick, but farming bomb arrows is still nice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure if this is your case or not but I since I have all 120 shrines and never really wandered on actual paths, I decided to take a horse out for a ride. I just came across Kass and finished a shrine quest I already had the shrine for. 

Are all your shrine quests complete? I'm at 35/42. </TEXT>
