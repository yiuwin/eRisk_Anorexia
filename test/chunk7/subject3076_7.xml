	<TEXT> I work around alcohol on a daily basis, but it has taken me a few years to build up to to this point.

At work I view alcohol as a commodity and detach from it. If I didn't have this ability, I fear that I wouldn't be able to happily do my job.

Do you think it's possible to work on how you view alcohol and move forwards?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've seen it work really well for people in tandem with therapy/support. I believe that my addiction affected me biologically, psychologically, socially and spiritually. I tackled each of these with a program that worked for me. 

I was put on Campral for the first few months of my recovery and I think it really helped me deal with the biological side of cravings. </TEXT>

Something that helped me was really parceling my days into moments that I could "control." The AA slogan "first things first" basically got me through my first year. </TEXT>

What I learned is that I didn't have to face it all at once. I stayed sober day by day, did the things I was told to do from my rehab and started to get better.

Specific

Measurable

Achievable

Realistic/reasonable

Timely

So like, "exercise" is on my list tomorrow. But...that's a terrible goal. Specifically, I am going to go to the gym for one hour tomorrow, after my doctor's appointment, at the gym I like. I will walk on the treadmill for that time.

As for daily goals in general, I set my priorities for the day the night before on a whiteboard in my kitchen. It helps me stay focused.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It took me some time to relax into sobriety and my new life.

In early recovery I wrote lists of things that stressed me out, and then I decided if they were things I could change or not. 

If I couldn't change it, I would work on letting it go. It's an ongoing process for me and it involves mostly managing my self-talk. Also, when I cannot let something go, it means that there must be something emotionally charged about it. So I explore a little there.

If I can change it, I decide the when/how. 

Sort of a labour intensive process but it's helped me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I admitted that I had a problem when I was in rehab. I think part of me knew that I'd need a lot of support to admit it...so I kind of waited.

It wasn't easy for me to admit it, but it did explain a lot of my behaviour. I thought I just had a drinking problem, or that I wasn't strong enough, or that I was weak.

I learned about addiction and realized there was a lot more going on than what I thought. My alcoholism had biological, psychological, social, and spiritual roots. It started to make sense why I was struggling so badly to stop drinking.

I hope you find some relief on SD until you go back to your support system. This subreddit is my home. </TEXT>

My alcohol problem kept telling me this. "Victoria, you're just going to relapse, might as well not even try. I mean, look at the stats, there's no WAY you can stay sober. Now, go grab a bottle and let's settle into this life we've created, okay?"

I ended up giving recovery a choice and telling that voice to go fuck itself. Then I got really hardcore into recovery. I went to meetings, I went to rehab, I literally did everything I could to increase my odds of succeeding. People thought I was taking it too far. No alcohol in the house? No bars? No vanilla extract? Staying at home and going to AA meetings? 

But yeah, I really wanted to beat the odds. And I did. And I am. So fuck you relapse odds. Fuck you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find that life is easier when I don't drink, I guess we're different in that sense. I can relate though. I used to believe that alcohol helped me cope, but it was just a band aid. Sooner or later it stopped me from learning how to cope with life in an adult way.

What other things are you interested in? Some hobbies I picked up were lifting weights, running, and volunteering.  </TEXT>

In early recovery (first two years for me) I decided to tell people BEFORE, if there had been a previous understanding with that person that we would drink. If it was a meetup for coffee or dinner, I wouldn't bother remarking that I don't drink anymore.

	<TEXT> For me I think my family was full of secrets. My plan is to allow our kids to talk to us as much as possible. I don't feel like scaring them with sharing what happened to me, or talking about the genetic risks. My husband and I plan on just talking, being present, and hoping our behaviours and habits will help limit their exposure to drugs and alcohol.

I think lots of parents try to keep their kids super busy, but I've seen that backfire. 

There is a lot of information out there on preventing substance abuse. [A huge wealth of research is here](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/preventing-drug-use-among-children-adolescents-in-brief) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally. I get that. What I do is that I have friends and family there to support me for regular life stuff. Like, stuff family and friends do. In my opinion, my friends and family should not have to share the burden of treating my substance abuse problem.

I leave the substance abuse to professionals and support groups. I leave the daily emotional support and family-aspects of life to family and friends.

For me it's been great. My family knows I have a support structure for sobriety, and that gives me a good foundation for a good relationship with them! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is super common. The reason you don't see people giving tips and tricks for moderating their alcohol use is that for many people on /r/stopdrinking, rules are a joke. For me at least, having two bottles of wine infront of me is a matter of "How fast can I finish these" or "Will I need more in a few hours". It's like putting food infront of a starving person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a lot of temptation in one day. In early days I didn't put myself anywhere near liquor. It was actually a requirement for the inpatient facility.

I was told that the days following exposure like this are the most important. Thoughts of "I can be around alcohol" may step into the territory of "I bet I can have one"

	<TEXT> I was like this before my problem got really bad. I remember thinking it was fun and endearing. Like I was some hard working, smart, young woman who could 'handle her booze."

I ended up becoming extremely physically and psychologically dependent on it. 

For me, one bottle of wine didn't cut it. So I start graduating onto the second bottle. Then that was embarassing, and so much sugar (omg gotta stay slim), so I transitioned to vodka. So much classier. Plus a 26 would last me two days. I bought less booze, hence didn't have a problem like buying 2 bottles of wine per day.

Basically, sooner or later, tolerance kicked in. Then the morning shakes started. From there it took me less than a year before I progressed into full-blown, every day drinking.

I don't say this to scare you or say 'U GOTTA STOP OR ELSE ULL TURN INTO ME'

This is simply my progression. </TEXT>
