	<TEXT> As stated by u/ThankYouDude (all credits to him) from r/malefashionadvice: "... Patagonia just went live today with their "Worn Wear" website. They are selling a ton of fleeces and jackets and a few other things for dirt cheap (dirt cheap for Patagonia). They are used, but I mean come on... Patagonia lasts one hundred years. I must admit I used to work for them, but I don't now. Just want to clue y'all in on a good deal." </TEXT>
