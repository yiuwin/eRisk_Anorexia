	<TEXT> Barely have enough time to think about comp and map. It's like the game assume you already knew which champ to pick once you hit the accept button. 

I was waiting to find out which healer my team is gonna play to pick a suitable tank, the guy decided to wait until there's 5s left. Then i picked mine, realized i misclicked, a buy order popped up because i hadn't unlocked Makoa yet, then came 30 minutes deserter penalty.

Then came me http://imgur.com/gallery/M3wJ6Ii

	<TEXT> Displaying masculinity without any effort. 

I have seen so many male being a total mess in life but is still somehow assertive, confident and resourceful. I have to be self-concious about everything i do to try and achieve that ( the way i dress, speak, act etc..), and even so i can barely keep up with it. Is it because of the lack of male hormones, or some external factor ?

This isn't a rant, just me genuiely asking for an explaination. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/56lqa3/githubcomjwashamgoogleinterviewuniversity_a/) is the post i was mentioning

He shared the materials on Github, and because i have never used GitHub before (or maybe i am stupid), the format was too confusing for me. I managed to download the "repository" but the some files are ".md". I tried opening them with notepad++ but all the hyperlink and bullet list are messed up. Do i have to download something else to run  ?

He also shared his ["Flashcards site repo"](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards), which, he said, contained his own database of flashcards and a tool to create my own. I have no idea how to use this either. I would be really grateful if you guys can guide me through all this stuff.
