	<TEXT> My class found out that our Spanish substitute used to be a male stripper. During recess, two of my classmates snuck into the class and played his stripping video on the whiteboard. Poor guy left the school in shame. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Question) 39k vs 29k but the 29k stack is a Fallen Empire? (Spoilers for Automated dreadnought) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So a Fallen Empire has attacked me and I'm wondering if my 39k stack could beat their 29k. My ships are equipped with III armour, Marauder Missiles, Gamma lasers, Tachyon Lances (battleships) and III Bombers. I'm currently rebuilding the Automated dreadnought and I'll have it in 10 months. Is it safe to attack the FE? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Spanish empire saw a decline in power and prestige and numerous bankruptcies . So I'd say that's a beginning of the end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, I'm currently on my phone so I'll keep this brief and if needed be, respond more thoroughly when I'm at my computer.

Firstly, I was unaware that the English pursued the Spanish.

Secondly, it was the beginning of the end for Spain, during Philipp II's rule, Spain was bankrupted five times and the Spanish armade was decimated. 

Now I've read your post and the amount of research you've put in is impressive. IMHO The Spanish was a larger blunder since the Spanish Empire only declined from that point. The English would create Great Britain and the largest empire in human history which would last well into the 20th century. After the Spanish armada, Spain's power and prestige would steadily decline.

Yes, Spain would last another 200 years but that battle proved to the world that Spain wasn't invincible as previously thought which was a great blow to Spanish prestige.

In the end it's a matter of opinion since alot can be said for both sides of the argument and history is open to interpretation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The storm damaged the armada and forced it into a narrow bay where the size and numbers of the ships became a disadvantage. The English could easily crush the fleet with fewer, more mobile ships. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get you. I however consider it a blunder since the idea was essentially "Let's invade England and convert them". I personally think that the end goal wasn't worth the risk (loosing the armada vs converting a country" and therefore was a blunder since calculating risk vs reward is a large part of a commanders job.
