If really enjoy this module be sure to support the developer and buy the paid version on Google Play. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ind.fem.black.xposed.mods </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll be using this modification when my [NFC Ring](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mclear/nfc-ring) arrives to turn on the screen when I hold my phone, and to lock it when it leaves my hand. I've added other tasks to let me change hands without locking the screen and configuring the PIN unlock depending on whether or not I'm connected to my home WIFI.

A taglost sound feature was recently added, but I'm hoping for the ability to be silent altogether because of how often I'll be using it. After using this module for a few weeks, and enabling NFC even when the screen is off (Don't forget to disable Google Wallet if you do this!) I still haven't noticed a difference in battery life.

	<TEXT> I'm not very experienced with Tasker. 

Netflix and Snapchat cause my phone to turn off if they're not swiped away in recents. It's a known issue caused by the 4.3 update that needs to be fixed by the app developers. 

I want automatically kill the apps when I leave them.

	<TEXT> I don't hear people talk about this feature very often, but it's one of the main reasons I bought the Nexus 4.

 Not only does the micro usb double as a slimport hdmi, but it also acts as an antenna extension. Your entire room, or your entire house might be acting as an antenna when you plug your phone in, depending on how your house is wired. 

 Right now the only other phone with this feature is the xperia Z. If you want even better signal plug in some headphones too. 

None of this is true but if this was a feature I would be so happy. 

TLDR: idk  </TEXT>
