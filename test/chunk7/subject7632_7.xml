	<TEXT> Sorry, dude. I know you had good intentions in writing this post, but Niantic doesn't want external apps / devices providing PoGo's distance, they don't want to do work for free if it doesn't possibly give them more income and they definitely don't want to give you features for free when their device (PoGo Plus) does exactly what you're asking for.

I'm not saying they won't add/edit things later on, but none of this is a priority to them now or for the foreseeable future.

To respond to your specific points:

1) The way distance is calculated in the game is maintained by Niantic. I think it's actually pretty accurate considering the amount of stuff they do to calculate it. No, I don't like missing out on distance, but I understand that's how the game works right now.

2) The locked phone thing is why they want people to buy the PoGo Plus.

3) The health app doesn't calculate distance the same way and it's an external source that could change and break PoGo's stuff. It's a massive effort to account for this and it would allow people to cheat by not actually walking outside. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of those (except Lapras) spawn in the biome around me.

As others have mentioned, you need to dig around in the desert biome(s).

So there's more than one desert biome type. One that my apartment is in (I'll call it desert biome 1) does NOT spawn Chansey, but it does very rarely spawn Aerodactyl, Lickitung, Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, Larvitar, Mareep, Kabuto, Omanyte and a couple other decent spawns. My common spawns are Nidoran (M), Nidroran (F), Geodude, Growlithe, Sandshrew, Snubble, Slugma, Houndour.

Now, the one you're looking for is similar to this (desert biome 2), except the most common spawns include Meowth and Mankey. Look for the above common spawns as well as very common Meowth and Mankey. That's the biome you'll find Chansey in. It also still spawns Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee and (I think) Aerodactyl

Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Maybe trainers submit recent catches of interest using an item or cooldown and the radio selects them from airing at nearly-random.

If it literally links to the trainer's last seen Pokmon or last catch then it eliminates rubbish reports. That could be great :)

 I am not sure how people would feel about the game inviting the area to sack their gym RNG style, so in-range might be be a fair trade-off.

If the gym is within your range of vision, you would see it fall anyway. I feel like that's not an issue. </TEXT>

Need to make sure everyone sees the sponsored stop first? FINE. Then do exactly that.
You open the Nearby/Sightings bar, it shows SPONSORED first, then Nearby, then Sightings. Everyone has to first see the sponsored stuff, but we can still willingly see the other stuff. But there's no reason not to show everything else. I'm even willing to deal with more invasive adverts if we actually get to see what's around us properly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't played the latest couple games in the original RPG series but I know I used to occasionally listen to the in-game radio show (which showed as text). It would be something like:

PokMart in Celadon City! For all your shopping needs!

Professor Oak joins us today. Professor, what's your favourite thing about Pokmon?

*Well, I love that there are so many DIFFERENT Pokmon. I'm doing a lot of studies on Dragon types at the moment.*

That's great, Professor! Thanks for your time.

Interesting news, trainers. Reports are coming in with large amounts of Dunsparce sightings in Dark Cave.

Team Rocket was sighted in Goldenrod City! Apparently a Mareep was stolen. If you have any information on this, please contact us.

I wish Pokmon Go had something like this. They could report nests or other spawns with a reference to nearby Pokstops and Gyms. Perhaps "Nearby" could be whatever is visible on the map, or perhaps a greater distance if possible... like anything within a 10km radius.

I could imagine the PoGo radio show could get information about the area and about the current user... It could be something like:

 It's a great day today, don't you think? Callers are calling in about their favourite Pokmon. We hear that subject7632 loves his PORYGON. He's been seen walking it around. Anyone else love their NORMAL type Pokmon? Let us know!

 The **WATERFALL CORNER FOUNTAIN** gym is standing proudly with Team Valor members holding strong at level 10! Well done, guys!

 The **CHILLI LANE** gym has just been taken over by Team Mystic! jared062's TYRANITAR looks really cool at the top of that gym. Mystic members should hurry over for support. Team Valor and Instinct members might want to strike back before it's too late!

 It appears that lots of trainers are finding Swinub near the **WORLD OF GOLF** Pokstop. Remember, Pokmon migrate often so you might want to check it out!

 Today on the show, we have Professor Willow for a word about berries! Professor, what new things could we learn about berries?

 *Hi, trainers! Well, RAZZ BERRIES are used to help catch Pokmon by lowering their catch rates. I like to use it on CYNDAQUIL! It makes it easier to catch that sneaky critter!*

 Thanks, Professor Willow!

EDIT: As mentioned in a comment, I would think the radio would either be an item or an option on the main menu. </TEXT>

Imagine 2 people are after the Tyranitar.

It can't despawn and then be treated differently for both of them.

Imagine 2000 people are after it.

Imagine this happens in every city.

	<TEXT> So, I'm completely assuming here, but  judging from the way their system works with everything else and from my understanding of how most server calls and procedures work, the server can't just send an array of a maximum of 9 Pokmon to us. It does some work, which definitely involves finding and loading everything that is within range... then calculates both Nearby and Sightings and sends us the relevant 9 Pokmon.

That means either way, it is still using its resources to do all this and the latter part of actually sending us the correct addresses or links to info is just telling our app where to look. The "sending to us" should be the most insignificant part.

So I stand by my thought of this being very much within their capabilities. They simply don't want to do this. (Or haven't done it yet.) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, being in Johannesburg, South Africa, it's not always flooded with spawns and because of that, I love The Silph Road and all the info I get from you guys. In trying to play my part, I occasionally reported nests when I found them.

I always checked the Global Nest Atlas for great, helpful information but since Gen 2 came out, I've seen a whole lot of new nests in the greater area around me and most of them make no sense. Most reports are something like "Hung around for 5 hours. Found 3 of them." or "Used a lure and found 2."

Or otherwise, it's an extremely common Pokmon in that biome. "Found 3 Slugma here today" and it's a desert biome.

The worst part is, I have no idea if any of these are actually nests and there's no way I'd have time to actually go to each one and check them.

I don't mind ignoring most of them, but I feel like I might be missing out real info by ignoring most of these nests :(

Any advice, guys?

EDIT: I don't think these are all trolls. I think most of them don't understand how nests work or they are new users who are just excitedly reporting whatever they find. </TEXT>

I would love Old Rod, Good Rod and Super Rod to be once-a-day use items. (To be fair, Niantic could sell bait in the store to allow people to re-use it as many times as they want... for a small price each time)

You'd have **a chance** to force a spawn for each one. You'd still be likely to get Magikarp instead of anything else, but imagine using a Super Rod and finding a Gyarados? Or a Dratini :)

That'd be awesome. </TEXT>

I would rather have even more invasive adverts and then see something I need as opposed to not seeing anything because Nearby takes priority. We're almost certainly receiving both of these sets of data anyway. They're just not all being shown.

In any case, where I live (South Africa) there's not a single sponsored stop, so it's just a crappy design from my point of view with literally no reason to hide Sightings from me.

I would even be okay if they had 3 tabs and it always showed (in order)

* Sponsored

* Nearby

* Sightings </TEXT>

It doesn't even have to be a push notification. Just an in-game notification would be fine.

* **For those saying spoofers will make more use of it:**
What difference does it really make compared to how spoofers/cheaters work now?
So instead of a spoofer taking over the gym once a day, it's twice a day. Either way, I wouldn't know until the next morning unless I also get a notification. It's just using the spoofer's resources anyway, because they'll have to re-battle the gym and heal etc again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can confirm Chansey is in ONE of the desert biomes. I live in one desert biome and a couple kilometers away, it changes to a different desert biome.

Let's call my biome Desert1. It spawned Lickitung during the Valentine's event. Notable spawns are now both Nidorans, Ekans, Slugma, Snubble, Houndour, etc. I also caught multiple Cyndaquil and Larvitar here.

The other biome is Desert2. It spawns mostly similar spawns but spawned Chansey during the Valentine's event. This biome spawns Meowth and Mankey much more often than the other biome. Occasionally I found Magnemite, Voltorb and Pikachu in this area.

Hope this helps :) </TEXT>

* How will gym Pokmon be chosen / kicked out if there's always 3 different sets of Pokmon? If I'm Mystic and I fight Valor's gym section, are those Valor Pokmon still kicked out in order?

* Will Prestige even exist in this model?

* I'm 90% sure that this would destroy the gym hold thing. On average, nobody will be able to keep a Pokmon in a gym for longer than a day.

* ... well, you did say that the coin system will be based on earning experience for your team as opposed to holding a spot though so I suppose this balances out. How would you earn experience for your team exactly? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, for Sprint and Starbucks. That means that these Pokstops were paid for by sponsor companies.

Remember, at the end of the day, it is business for them and they will only really want to do anything if it makes them money.

I personally think that there's many changes they can make to make everyone happy and they should do it quickly to give everyone a better experience, but clearly, that's not their priority. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, but before my points above, I did say

 If Niantic cannot re-distribute Pokstops or add stops to rural areas then...

I understand everyone wants more stops and spawns, but we also have to remember that the more resources they use in the game, the less stable it becomes for everyone. Nobody likes the lack of stuff in their area, but nobody wants the server to go down when they finally see a Tyranitar. In fairness, we don't know how Niantic distributes their resources, but I think it's safe to assume that if they could easily add Pokstops, spawns and gyms everywhere, they would have done it by now. Otherwise, they're just prioritising the wrong thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sounds like you've had bad luck but unfortunately, everything you've mentioned is based on other factors.

* Your experiences with catching are purely based on the random nature of the game. I'm sorry you've had some frustrating times, but that's just how it is. There's a chance of this happening to you or anyone.

* Pokmon all spawn and de-spawn on set timers. This has nothing to do with whether you show up at a certain time. I've had plenty of situations like that.

* Egg hatches are a bit of a mystery to me still. I admit, I still don't understand whether the egg you pick up is related to your biome, etc. Either way, I've had a pretty fair distribution of eggs and I can't complain too much about that.

* Egg distributions are actually much more fair now (in my opinion) with the changes they've made and unfortunately, they were never specifically meant for you to get more candy for rarer Pokmon. Yes, Larvitar might hatch with lots of candy, but Charmander might only give you a few. This is how the game works.

Sounds like you're just having a lot of bad luck and frustration. I totally agree with you about how annoying some of this is, but if you've ever played the original games, you'll know how annoying certain things were. In Pokmon Red/Blue/Yellow, I can't count the number of times I knocked our Articuno while trying to catch it and had to reload my save. In Pokmon Gold/Silver/Crystal, I can't count the number of hours I spent trying to find all the Unown.

Trust me, EVERYONE gets annoyed and frustrated sometimes and then hopefully, something awesome happens to make you remember why you wanted to play it in the first place.

If it makes you feel better, apart from the actual game, I have a constant struggle with my cellphone reception which has (on many, many occasions) lost me rare Pokmon, stopped me from winning gym battles, etc. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Some suggestions for all the things rural players need. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-08 11:25:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my apologies for the long post, but here's my thoughts on the things that people actually need in the game:

* Wild spawns
* Items / Pokstops
* Stardust and XP
* Regional exclusives
* Legendary / unreleased Pokmon.

I think there's many ways that these things can be handled so that rural players and anyone else without easy access to everything in the game can still enjoy something. I hope Niantic makes some changes with regards to this. But here's what I think.

-----

**Wild spawns**

If Niantic cannot increase spawns in rural areas or re-distribute spawns fairly, then here's my simple suggestion on how to make spawns fair.

If...

* your game has been open and running for 30 minutes
* not a single Pokmon has appeared in nearby or sightings
* with distance tracking etc summarising the entire 30 minutes, you are within the speed limit (basically if your point at the start, and your point at the end can be travelled within the speed limit)
* you have not yet received your daily catch streak for the day

... you should have an automatic incense spawn. That's it. Just one spawn. That way, this isn't really a way to cheat etc, but for rural players who just want ONE catch for the day to continue their streak, you get something without having to travel a million kilometers. If it runs away, this won't screw you over because you haven't yet gotten your daily catch so you would have to wait another 30 minutes if you want another spawn without going to a better area.

-----

**Pokstops / Items**

If Niantic cannot re-distribute Pokstops or add stops to rural areas then...

* if your game has been open and running for 30 minutes
* if there are no Pokstops on your entire map
* you have not yet received your daily Pokstop streak

... a temporary one-time-use Pokstop should appear within your trainer scan circle (within swiping range). That's it. Just one. That way, rural players can still continue their streak and get at least a few items for the day. This Pokstop will work like an incense spawn where only you can see it. Instead of turning purple when it has been swiped, it will disappear. If the player has no Pokeballs of any kind, at least one Pokball is guaranteed in this swipe.

-----

**Stardust and XP**

This has been suggested so many times and I don't understand why it hasn't come up from Niantic yet... but we need some sort of mini-game.

So, with the above two suggestions, every player should still receive daily stardust and XP. However, for rural players, this means that there will be nothing to do after this single point of the day. Many people have suggested mini-games and AR-related additions.

Here's my suggestion:

**HIDE-AND-SEEK.**

A Pokmon you choose from your storage will play hide-and-seek with you. Why this type of game? Because this will still require you to physically move around and thus falls under the theme of the game. 

* Once you start the hide-and-seek game, you will see a different version of your normal map. 

* On this map, you'll see NO WILD SPAWNS, POKSTOPS or GYMS. You WILL however see random obstacles and hiding places (rocks, trees, a tiny abandoned shack, etc.). All of this will load in the entire map area you had when you clicked to start the hide-and-seek game.

* Possible hiding spots will defer depending on the size of your chosen Pokmon. (Weedle may be hiding behind a fire hydrant or a small bush. Snorlax may be hiding behind a shack or a large tree.)

* On the map, you'll need to be within range of the possible hiding spot to examine it. There is a small chance that you will find your buddy, a small chance that you will find stardust or an item and a very large chance that you will find nothing. Either way, the hiding spot will disappear and if you haven't found your buddy, you'll have to search at another spot. Straying too far away from the hide-and-seek area will end the game, or at any time, you can give up.

* When you have found your buddy, you will get a small amount of stardust and XP. At most, it should be the same 100XP and 100 Stardust as catching a Pokmon.

* While moving faster than the speed limit, you will not be able to examine a hiding spot.

* Distance will be tracked as normal while in the hide-and-seek arena. At the end of the game, your distance will be added to your current egg(s) accordingly.

* Perhaps after finding your buddy, as another reward, you would get to see them in a small photo arena similar to the catch screen where you can take a photo of them with or without AR.

-----

**Regional exclusives**

Despite the appeal of exclusives being rare and... well... exclusive... I don't understand why this would be something so limited. If the suggestion is to literally travel to another part of the world, I'm sure Niantic should understand that most players do not have the ability to do that.

Either every part of the world should have their own exclusive Pokmon or everyone should eventually have some opportunity to catch them. I can't say Niantic won't do this as they've already shown that they are adding regionals and may possibly choose to migrate them. I hope they do, but make sure to spread them out evenly so anyone in the world can participate.

-----

**Legendary Pokmon**

I am extremely worried about this. If Europe can be the only people to get Mr Mime, South America the only people to get Heracross, etc... what stops Niantic from simply releasing Mew in only one part of the world? How will any rural player have a chance of getting this?

I personally believe legendary events should be related to GYMS. This way, nobody will be left out. If you have to travel a bit to find your nearest gym, I think it's only fair, as opposed to EVERYONE having to go to the Empire State Building or something.

Suggestion 1:

* Every player gets flagged for whether they already have or have not completed the event for the legendary Pokmon and will see gyms differently depending on that.

* If not completed, they will see every gym around them as a legendary event. The entire gym game will be unavailable to people who have not competed yet (but you will still be able to collect coins from existing gym positions you hold).

* The legendary event gym will be scaled to your level and your highest 6 Pokmon's CP.

* The gym will work in a similar way to a normal gym except the top Pokmon will be a scaled-CP version of the legendary in question.

* The way the fight and the team at the gym work is up to Niantic. Perhaps it can be Team Rocket as many have suggested. Perhaps they will all be the legendary Pokmon and you'll fight it 6 times. Either way, it should be difficult and may even require multiple fights like taking down a gym. It should be difficult enough that not everyone should easily win it the first time.

* Either way, after winning the event, an egg with that legendary Pokmon will be awarded to the player. Perhaps it could be a much higher distance requirement. 25km or even 50km seems fair to me.

"Hey everybody! Niantic's my home.

We have thousands of spawns and every biome.

I don't understand what the complaints are about.

I maxed out my storage and I'm still throwing 'mons out.

-----

I have every Pokmon (yes, even Mew).

I have three hundred and fifty party Pikachu.

I have to admit, it's really quite funny,

I never ever have to spend any money.

-----

I get everything for free while testing and checking.

Gyms every day! I'm winning and wrecking!

I caught everything and have every gym too.

Ooh! I know! We'll release Gen 2!

-----

If these suckers have to keep spending,

I won't ever have to start bartending!

Maybe if it was only 2 hours I waste,

Changes wouldn't come at such a slow pace.

-----

But streaks are my favourite and I have to catch Typhlosion,

Those rural players won't cause an explosion

If they have to wait a few more weeks,

While I get to win this game and THEN make some tweaks.

-----

They might have to pay every day.

While I get to do things my way.

Oh no! Another email from some player afar.

Too lazy. Just gonna reply with... r." </TEXT>

I'm glad you get to experience the game as it is meant to be played.

I, however, do not always get that experience. My game works flawlessly at home with wi-fi where I don't have a single spawn or Pokstop. My cell reception does not stay constant while I'm moving outside where I actually need to go to find spawns and Pokstops. Unfortunately, this causes a multitude of problems and it would just be very helpful to me if the game directly told me when it was disabled because of speed and when it was disabled because my reception isn't picking up anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair enough. Maybe "ridiculous" is too strong a word. I understand the reason it's blocked and I agree with that. I disagree that this is effective or efficient.

Imagine if you're driving in real life and your car switched off at an intersection because you're supposed to stop at the stop street.

Yes, when you get your licence, you understand the concept but there should be a notice at every single stop street so that you understand what's going on.

In the same way, I think the Pokstop, egg and Nearby/Sightings tab should have the relevant messages. Not just a general pop-up before everything gets disabled. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I find it ~~ridiculous~~ frustrating that there's no indication of whether you're able or not able to accumulate egg distance at your current speed.

I find it ~~ridiculous~~ frustrating that Pokstops say "Try again later" when you're moving too quickly, even though they also say that when anything else goes wrong.

And most of all, I find it ~~ridiculous~~ frustrating  that the Nearby/Sightings tab still says "No Sightings yet" when you're moving too fast. Even though there could actually be no Pokmon around you. You wouldn't know until you wasted more time double-checking.

All of these (and many more) parts of the game have triggers or flags to tell you when you're moving too fast to use them.

Why does it not directly say that anywhere on the app apart from the annoying pop-up that doesn't make sense?

My phone is GPS drifting while I'm sitting on my couch? Yes, I'm a passenger. Not sure why they can't change this silly phrase.

Why does it not say "Moving too fast to keep egg comfortable" on the egg screen?

Why does it not say "Moving too fast to check this Pokstop for items" when you try to swipe it?

Why does it not say "Moving too fast to detect nearby Pokmon" on our Nearby/Sightings tab.

I feel like this was purposely left out and confused people who didn't understand why their Pokstop kept saying "Try again later"

Niantic should simply add in these minor messages or indicators. Even some kind of blinking light or static on the nearby tab would make more sense. I feel like it's less immersive because of this lack of communication.

I understand there's a pop-up message for speed limits, but that's pretty annoying and it doesn't directly show you what you can and cannot use. All the messages or responses in parts of the game that actually are affected by speed-locks give a generic error that could refer to anything.

Anyone else feel this could be made better?

-----

**EDIT:** Sorry if I sound like a whiny little kid. I wrote this while in a bad mood. My bad. Anyway, I'm not saying I disagree with the speed limits. I'm saying I disagree with the way we have to realise or figure out what it affects. Niantic literally has programming to detect the specific things that it needs to disable. Why can't those same points of detection be used to change the messages that it sends us? I want them to point out what is disabled because of the speed limit.

**EDIT:** I have bad reception in my area and I live in an area where Pokmon spawns aren't always everywhere. Sometimes, there actually are no spawns. And sometimes the Pokstop doesn't work because my internet recently stopped working or something. I occasionally miss a Pokmon because I think that there's nothing there, but as soon as I pass the area, I see that something pops up in sightings, knowing full-well that the only nearby spawn is the point I just passed. If they had different error messages, nobody would assume anything. </TEXT>

There's no Ditto transformation rate. I feel like so many people still don't understand this.

If the Pidgey you caught transformed into Ditto after you caught it, it was not a Pidgey that spawned with a chance of being Ditto. It's a Ditto that spawns and it looks and acts like a Pidgey.

It's either a Ditto or not a Ditto. It does not have a chance to be Ditto. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before the Valentine's weekend, Kabuto, Lickitung, Chansey and Porygon were the only remaining basic Pokmon I needed in my 'dex (apart from regionals).

More than once, in the middle of the night, Kabuto and Lickitung showed up near me, but far enough that I'd have to drive. I hated that luck.

Thankfully I caught them all within that short amount of time :)
Now I just need to walk some Pokmon to complete my non-regional Gen 1 'dex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found a Larvitar in a Clefairy biome. Clefairy is the usual spawn and since Gen 2, Chikorita spawns in that biome as well. I previously found a Dragonite in that area. So I know it's the one that people are referring to. Other spawns include Poliwag and Ledyba. Hope that helps.

EDIT: If it makes anybody less jealous, it was 10 CP. It's my fault for saying "PLEASE LET ME FIND ONE. EVEN IF IT'S 10CP"

Don't say it guys. It really happens. </TEXT>
