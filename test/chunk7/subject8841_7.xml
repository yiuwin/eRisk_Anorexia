	<TEXT> No doubt, his mixtapes are arguably better lyrically than his albums, UP was amazing as you said but if he just went back to his mixtape style after it he could of been top 5 young rapper. He has cool concepts and great production but all he wants to rap about is him being biracial </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Y'all probably won't agree with me but logic, his mixtapes and first album were fucking great, then came his second album and more biracial based material and then he released everybody while also saying that he's leaving the rap game after his next album </TEXT>
