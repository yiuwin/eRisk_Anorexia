	<TEXT> Blast is one of, if not the only game mode that is on every single map. I don't think it would require much work to add, and would please DLC/ Season Pass owners to get some offline content. If we had the choice for one game mode I'd choose blast for this reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't thank you enough for this.

I'm probably going to attempt to pet her if she approaches me while I'm sat on the sofa. I have been told she'll probably come round to me whilst I'm eating because she is greedy, but I'm not to give her anything.

I'm relieved to her an open mouth can mean relaxed! My automatic assumption was aggressive. 

I'm always very jumpy around dogs. I was playing with a border collie at my friends house. Throwing a ball and he would return it. But he would drop the ball on my foot, I'd go to grab and he would growl...so I'd jump back quickly from fear. After a while of doing this, the border collie hopped on the sofa and placed the ball on my lap. Assuming this way a sign to say "it's okay"? 

Thank you again for your kind words!! It has helped me a lot!! I was quite shocked to receive so much help.

	<TEXT> Thank you for that!! I'm happy to hear you overcame your fears! I was starting to think I'd be stuck with it for life. I'll often walk an extra 10/15 minutes out of the way to avoid dogs that aren't on a leash in my local area. But I'll make sure to give a positive impression from interactions with my girlfriend! :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have spoken to my girlfriend and she knows I have a fear. I'm not sure she knows quite how anxious I get. 

I've told her I don't want them to put the dog somewhere separate. I was to face it head on. 

The GSD is 11 years old and female. I have been told she will bark at me. And this will really increase my anxiety. Is there anything I should avoid? I'm not sure how accurate the Dog Whisperer is, but does no eye contact, no physical contact a good guideline for meeting the dog?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Help] "Fear" of dogs. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-16 00:17:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So...I wasn't sure where to post this, and I figured where better than a subreddit about dogs! 

Brief History - My fear came around from when I was around 5 or 6 years old, and a white terrier attempted to bite me. I was playing with my Nana's dog and the terrier (belonging to a family friend) ran up and tried to bite me. 

My dad is also terrified of dogs. Since I saw my dad as a fearless super hero, to see him afraid of dogs made me terrified and I saw them as dangerous.  My dad has been bitten by multiple dogs. Usually when he was out on walks, dogs will run up and bite him. He tries to just look ahead but his nerves get the better of him. I'm assuming dogs can sense this making them uncomfortable and feel the need to attack?

The Problem - I am going over to my girlfriends house. Worried first of all to meet her parents. They also have a German Shepherd. I was looking for advice on how to calm my nerves. I will be extremely uncomfortable when their dog approaches me. The dog is female if that helps? I am just very unsure about how to interact/ act around the dog. Thanks in advance! 

TL:DR - Afraid of dogs. Going to girlfriends house who owns a German Shepherd, how should I proceed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I purchased Burnout 3: Takedown from my local game shop. I got home, tried it out, played the first race and first crash. It worked beautifully. But if I try to play anything else, it takes me to an eternal loading screen. I've tried restarting the console, cleaning the disc, but it still won't work. The 2 missions I've played work fine but nothing else does. Is there a fix for this or should I return it? </TEXT>
