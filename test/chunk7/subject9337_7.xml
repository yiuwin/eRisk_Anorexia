	<TEXT> Had this happen when I was about to sleep with this guy for the first time.  I was pretty embarrassed and apologized.  We did it anyway.  Still dating him over a year later and we still laugh about it occasionally. </TEXT>

The thigh gap is pretty much nonexistent when I stand up straight and try to smash my ankles together :'D  My knees are also uneven. lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes!  I was thinking of posting a picture of the selfie thread concerning this.  My knees actually prevent my ankles from touching when standing straight up.  I have very narrow hips so I'm guessing that contributes.  

edit: I added a pic of this awkwardness to the selfie thread; didn't know if it would be allowed in other threads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You cannot tell her she can't have certain foods, even if it's candy and desserts.  You cannot police her food.  You can tell her how her unhealthy lifestyle and weight makes you FEEL, but you cannot control her or fix her.  She has to make that decision for herself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And when guys think there are girls like this and want to date someone who can match their eating habits and stay thin grrrr.  Sometimes I will splurge when I'm with my boyfriend and he'll say things like wow you eat more than me and stay skinny.  Nope that's not how it works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's this girl I follow on social media that constantly posts pictures of herself with massive amounts of food.  Entire pizzas, multiple pounds of meat, lots of cake.  She weighs maybe 110 pounds soaking wet.  Her sister is a super model.  But she makes a point to make these food posts all the time.  I don't know who she thinks she's kidding.  I guess it's possible that if these huge meals are the only thing she's eating everyday + working out but damn if it doesn't come off as "fast metabolism" bragging.  I guess it's also possible that she'll take a picture of the entire meal but not eat all of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think most of them probably restrict.  Can you imagine the competitiveness they must feel?  Not saying it's impossible that some are blissfully unaware of how they eat and have tiny appetites but yeah... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was shocked by her stupidity more than anything.  I was married at the time as well which made her comment even more ridiculous.  Moved on from that therapist pretty quickly after that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many therapists are unequipped to deal with eating disorders.  If it's not something you ask about upfront when choosing a therapist, there's a good chance it might not be something they studied and could handle it ignorantly when it's brought up.  I once had a therapist when I was about 100 pounds and near suicidal who told me that men didn't like bones so I should gain weight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you, but when I was fat I never had anyone say anything about my body.  It's obvious people feel much more comfortable with commenting on my body because I'm thin.  But when I think about, if I had been fat shamed even ONCE, it would probably have hurt worse than all of the skinny shaming comments combined. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No matter how much she's suffering it's not really ok for her to comment about your body or police your eating habits.  It's extremely hypocritical of her.  Don't be afraid to tell her this if it's making you uncomfortable.  Anyway it sounds like she is not willing to be helped right now, and you can't help someone who doesn't want help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, sorry to hear that. :(  Mine stopped growing with the medication, but I've been off it for awhile because doctor/insurance/neglecting my medical health reasons but I no longer have any symptoms.  Probably should check on it eventually though. _  It took forever to diagnose and it's like this huge inconvenience I wish I didn't have to think about.  Interesting to find someone on here that has one too though!  Hope everything goes well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pituitary prolactinoma?  I have one too.  I haven't noticed any change in my weight loss/gain rate because of it.  I know people have "conditions" but they are often used as a huge excuse as to why they just can't lose weight and how thin people are "so lucky."  Makes me bitter I guess.  

I think that appetite and emotional attitude towards foods makes much more of a difference, which I guess could be genetic or influenced by upbringing or trauma. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Weight isn't really genetic though.  It's calories in  calories out.  If your brother is taller and/or still growing it might seem like he can eat a lot more and not gain weight because his body may need more calories than yours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, that med almost killed me.  Completely nuked my appetite and escalated my ED to dangerous levels.  One of the side effects is anorexia, not anorexia nervosa but the actual lack of appetite.  They put me on it after ignoring my concerns about having an eating disorder because I was at a healthy weight. :')  Anyway I was on it for a long time and the lack of appetite eventually went away, but I did get to about a BMI of 15 on it before I "recovered." </TEXT>
