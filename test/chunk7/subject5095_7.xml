	<TEXT> Another things to try (not sure if anyone else mentioned it yet), is to first talk to his other teachers to see how he is behaving in their classes.  That will let you know a) what they are doing to control the problem, and b) you can start to work together to solve this issue.  From what you describe it can't just be your class, so band together to come up with a solution.

What my school does is have group teacher-parent conferences in cases like this.  All his teachers, his counselor, and one of the principals sits down with the parents and usually the student.  It is very powerful, especially for the parents and student (but also for the teachers).  Get everything out in the open -- don't hold anything back --, come to group consensus on what is expected from here on out, and from my experience this can correct most behavioral issues.  This also great for admin because they were at the meeting, too, and agreed to whatever behavioral contract you come up with.  In that case, they just about have to back you up if the kiddo starts marching down the wrong path again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Path to Power: The Years of Lyndon Johnson - Robert Caro - nar. Grover Gardner

Just finished it -  all 40-plus hours.  Worth it, though.  Caro turns a figure I knew little about into a story that's both inspiring and tragic.  Some of the other prominent figures in Johnson's life are equally inspiring/tragic -- most notably Sam Rayburn.  I need to take a break, but I'm looking forward to volume 2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So far two main reasons.  First how he came to power is an incredible story.  How do you go from dirt poor in middle of nowhere Texas, start climbing the political ladder during the Great Depression, being by most accounts a self-absorbed jerk yet somehow get the most powerful people in the land to support you, and with an all-consuming drive make it to the presidency?

Secondly, the book reads like a well-written novel.  Isn't dry at all, and the author knows how to lead you into the next chapter.  Not really cliff-hangers, but you definitely want to keep reading.  I'm going from knowing almost nothing about Johnson to being completely absorbed in his story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've probably heard this before, but teaching does tend to get easier with more years under your belt.  You develop more tools to work with, you learn how to handle situations that come up over and over again, you become much more comfortable with what you are teaching, and you learn how to deal with parents and students better.  Over time you start to see the same things happening again and again, and since you've been through it before, and hopefully you've learned from your mistakes, you are able to deal with them.

As far as respect goes, if you are a second year teacher, that often comes with not having a reputation yet.  Reputations take time to build.  But here is an advantage you have:  you're at the point where you get to decide what sort of reputation you have.  Reputations are double-sided.  They can be very advantageous, but also if you develop the wrong kind (examples: lazy teacher, tries to be every kid's best friend, doesn't know what they are doing, etc.), then it can take a long time to change that sort of bad reputation.  Reputations are important, through, so keep yours in the back of your mind as you make your way through this second year.

Also with time, you learn how to manage it (time, I mean) better.  Best tip I can give you is try and leave the work in the classroom.  Try your best to not bring it home.  Even if that means staying a bit later after school, try and walk out the door without taking anything home.  Have home be a sanctuary where you can recharge, and that is so much easier if you get in the habit of leaving all the work related issues at school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do a day long retreat with one of my student groups every year.  The key to making it a bonding thing is to put them into situations with students they don't normally hang out with.  So what I do is ahead of time I place them into mixed teams (usually four or five students) that they'll be with all day long for the various activities.  I try to make the groups as diverse as possible so that BFFs, cliques, and grade levels aren't together.  Then I have them participate in all the activities as a team.  One of the favorite team activities we do almost every year is a photo scavenger hunt.  Not only do they have to work as a team, but they come away with lots of silly photos of themselves with their new buddies. </TEXT>
