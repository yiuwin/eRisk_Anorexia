	<TEXT> When Izo first appeared I thought "damn finally a badass Capricorn (if we ignore LC)", but on this issue, damn Capricorn confirmed as major wuss. You can't name one lame gold saint in LC, they are all awesome, even their Gaiden manga was awesome. To me ND was, is and will be a major let down, if you stop to think about it Kurumada's best fights weren't ever the last ones:

1. Galaxian Wars: best fight: Shiryu *vs* Seiya

2. Black Saints: Black Dragon *vs* Shiryu

3. ~~Silver Saints: Don't really care for them~~ Shiryu *vs* Algol

4. Sanctuary: Shaka *vs* everyone (some might say Kamus *vs* Hyoga; Shura *vs* Shiryu; Aphrodite *vs* Shun; but nonetheless it isn't Saga *vs* everyone)

5. Poseidon: Kanon *vs* Ikki

You can see my point, right? We've seen most of the saints and they don't look like much, even though LC isn't canon, it is one of my favourite animes ever. Manigold was awesome, their Taurus, Aldebaran, was much better than 90's Taurus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He has successfully escaped Saga as Pope, then managed to fight Shura without any cloth and was able to hold his feet for awhile. He still has strong influence on the Sagittarius Cloth, sending it to Seiya several times and even writing a message. It was also suggested that [he was the strongest ](http://saintseiya.wikia.com/wiki/Sagittarius_Aiolos#Techniques_and_abilities).

Other than that, why would Seiya need Sagittarius' cloth to defeat the bad guy in 100% of the films? Why did Aioros was the one leading the 12 saints next to the Wailing Wall, couldn't he just send his cloth and let Dohko do it?

I know we can't consider LC, but its Sagittarius was a badass there too, I just think it is too repetitive, even though all saints in LC look awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Blades, once disbanded after the end of the Great War, were back together all thanks to the Dovahkiin, however, once again, the former protectors of the emperors and dragonborns weren't able to save someone with the Dragon's Blood. the Last Dragonborn had fallen.

They were prepare to give him a proper burial at sea with an enormous ship provided by Elisif, each hold was thankful for what the dragonborn has done to them and helped in any way they could: Markarth provided the jewellery; Whiterun gave the alleged head of Numinex as a decoration for the ship; Falkreath was represented by Runil, as a priest of Arkay and many other presents from each hold and guilds that was developed thanks to the help of the thane, the harbinger and many other rights held.

As Grandmaster, Delphine was appointed as the one to shoot the fire arrow at the boat, she took her longbow, arranged the arrow with its tip soaked in dwarven oil before lighting it up she muttered: "*^For ^a ^person ^as ^cursed ^as ^you ^were ^blessed ^I ^can ^only ^wish ^that ^your ^last ^place ^to ^rest ^is ^Sovngarde* " and she lighten it up proceeding to shoot it. It wasn't a windy day as usual so the arrow would hit smoothly the target, but it started slowing down, and slowing and it stopped right before it reached the ship imbued in oil, the spirit of the Dragonborn rises and, incredulous, sees himself in the world of the living, even though not materialised.

A glistening bright light brought a crystal clear gem which said in a saddened, but ostentatious voice: "Such a shame, mortal, you were stupendous as you kept bringing down so many necromancers, and not only that, but you made my light shine across Nirn. If you only had called for me earlier, I'd be able to trick Death, welcoming you in my Coloured Rooms, and you could return home any time you wanted to destroy more of those filthy creatures."

"Having the spirit of an Orsimer and cleansing my sanctuary when my followers couldn't keep it safe" -- it could be heard an angry, heavy grunt -- "I come forward to protect this honourable creature and I'll welcome you into my realm".

The spectre of a boisterous wolf appear amidst the latter beings: "Silence, fallen Aedra, what do you intend on doing with a creature so in tune with nature such as this one? We are talking about the ultimate hunter here, animals, creatures, daedras, World-Eaters... I can feel, the need for *the hunt* emanates strongly from this one, we'll ride to the Hunting Grounds aiming for the greatest game of all".

Rats come from the lower compartments, when then a rat king also approaches the spirit: "Was I summoned here because most of the Daedric Princes were gathered here? I don't have a particular interest in this mortal, nor I intend to have quarrels with any of you so solve this matter between yourselves".

A murder of crows approaches, they are all darker than the winter nights of Skyrim, they land forming a perfect circle from which rises the Night Mistress. "We had a contract, right my nightingale? I ought to know how were you able to overcome the lack of luck I provided for the Thieves Guild when I clearly worked as an encumbrance for all of those from that guild".

(...)

There are still 11 Daedric Princes to go, if someone reads this and is interested to continue reading do let me know and I'll resume it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What can we gather from today's chapter about Germa 66:

1. Reiju was a prototype of Germa super humans;
2. Ichiji and Niji are the strongest because Sora gave birth to two kids with the drug in its full extent;
3. Sanji was able to be born without the emotionless trait due to Sora's drugs;
4. Yonji is weak because Sora probably had some traces of the drug inside her making the youngest son emotionless, but weak. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On the anime, Shiryu loses his eyesight three times, meanwhile on the manga it happens two times.

1. Against Perseus Algol

       1.1 Recovers at Cancer's temple, when Seiya pours the water of life and Shiryu reaches the 7th sense

2. Against Chrysaor Krishna

   2.1 When Shiryu reaches the 8th sense in Hades arc

3. The third time, on the anime, he'd be blind in the beginning of Hades arc, sanctuary chapter.

    3.1 Here he would briefly regain eyesight between arcs but would become blind again, and finally restoring his eyesight by achieving the 8th sense </TEXT>

So it takes time until the star's bright comes to Earth, but a blackhole damage is quite easily verified. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually studies from the Sudanese University of Chemistry, the Poison Illness Institute of Sudan (P.I.S.S. for short), said that after a poison passes its expiration date it doesn't become neither more or less dangerous, it becomes its own antidote, that why when you are bitten by a snake someone has to suck the venom - it has a quick expiration date -, it has to get in touch with air and then the person that sucked the venom will have to apply it back in the same place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. I think that what SS does with the nest of maggots is way much worst.

2. It doesn't, necessarily, make him evil, he was just trying to escape.

3. I don't remember about the arm thing, but sure it could be bad.

4. Mayuri is a saint for you? Urahara?

5. A bit bad

6. If they would die anyway, what's the point in telling them?

7. Wonderweiss is not a child, also that point in general wouldn't make him bad.

8. Yes... taking down a kingdom is so bad, are you British or something? No one likes monarchies.

9. Talking about arrancars here?

10. Halibel is alive, he did backstab her though

11. He didn't force Gin to do anything, he had reasons of his own to tag along with Aizen *cough cough* Matsumoto's soul theory

12. Kubo's way to stall a bit, someone as powerful as him wouldn't give a fling about them.

13. That was a good one hahaha

I don't think Aizen is evil, he might have done some bad things, but nope he isn't evil. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What about this: 

 1 - Ryuujin Jakka needs oxygen, with just Senescencia he can stops three of the four abilities, the fourth one Yama-jii's armour would be nullified if he got close. 
 2 - How can Irooni work if Shunsui doesn't have any purple in him? Probably Kageoni would be the only useful shikai technique, I'd wonder if Daruma-san ga Koronda would be useful too, but I'm not so sure. He wouldn't use his bankai, but if he did the most useful ability would be Ichidanme all the rest can be rejected by Barragan's ability.
 3 - Histugaya too much hype, barely could fight Halibel, he wouldn't last long against Barragan.

Honestly I don't even like Barragan, but I don't think that none other than a kidou master could fight and "kill" him, thus Hachigen, Tessai, Sousuke, Retsu, Juushiro or Kisuke could kill him. </TEXT>
